<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Patients who are prescribed medicines take only about half of their doses and many stop treatment entirely. Assisting patients to adhere better to medicines could improve their health, and many studies have tested ways to achieve this.</P>
<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We updated our review from 2007 to answer the question: What are the findings of high-quality studies that tested ways to assist patients with adhering to their medicines?</P>
<P>
<B>Search strategy</B>
</P>
<P>We retrieved studies published until 11 January 2013. To find relevant studies we searched six online databases and references in other reviews, and we contacted authors of relevant studies and reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection criteria</B>
</P>
<P>We selected studies reporting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a group receiving an intervention to improve medicine adherence with a group not receiving the intervention. We included trials if they measured both medicine adherence and a clinical outcome (e.g. blood pressure), with at least 80% of patients studied until the end.</P>
<P>
<B>Main results</B>
</P>
<P>The studies differed widely regarding included patients, treatments, adherence intervention types, medicine adherence measurement, and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we could not combine the results in statistical analysis to reach general conclusions, as it would be misleading to suggest that they are comparable. Instead, we provide the key features and findings of each study in tables, and we describe intervention effects in studies of the highest quality. The present update included 109 new studies, bringing the total number to 182. In the 17 studies of the highest quality, interventions were generally complex with several different ways to try to improve medicine adherence. These frequently included enhanced support from family, peers, or allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered education, counseling, or daily treatment support. Only five of these RCTs improved both medicine adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common characteristics for their success could be identified. Overall, even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence varied among studies. It is uncertain how medicine adherence can consistently be improved so that the full health benefits of medicines can be realized. We need more advanced methods for researching ways to improve medicine adherence, including better interventions, better ways of measuring adherence, and studies that include sufficient patients to draw conclusions on clinically important effects.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-09 03:35:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of interventions intended to enhance patient adherence to prescribed medications for medical conditions, on both medication adherence and clinical outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-10-14 15:10:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated searches of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, including CENTRAL (via http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary/search/), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO (all via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and Sociological Abstracts (via ProQuest) on 11 January 2013 with no language restriction. We also reviewed bibliographies in articles on patient adherence, and contacted authors of relevant original and review articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included unconfounded RCTs of interventions to improve adherence with prescribed medications, measuring both medication adherence and clinical outcome, with at least 80% follow-up of each group studied and, for long-term treatments, at least six months follow-up for studies with positive findings at earlier time points.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted all data and a third author resolved disagreements. The studies differed widely according to medical condition, patient population, intervention, measures of adherence, and clinical outcomes. Pooling results according to one of these characteristics still leaves highly heterogeneous groups, and we could not justify meta-analysis. Instead, we conducted a qualitative analysis with a focus on the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias for study design and the primary clinical outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present update included 109 new RCTs published since the previous update in January 2007, bringing the total number of RCTs to 182; we found five RCTs from the previous update to be ineligible and excluded them. Studies were heterogeneous for patients, medical problems, treatment regimens, adherence interventions, and adherence and clinical outcome measurements, and most had high risk of bias. The main changes in comparison with the previous update include that we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence also specifically among the studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) do not try to classify studies according to intervention type any more, due to the large heterogeneity; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses, in acknowledgement of the need to make collective advancement in this difficult field of research. Of all 182 RCTs, 17 had the lowest risk of bias for study design features and their primary clinical outcome, 11 from the present update and six from the previous update. The RCTs at lowest risk of bias generally involved complex interventions with multiple components, trying to overcome barriers to adherence by means of tailored ongoing support from allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals) or daily treatment support (or both), and sometimes additional support from family or peers. Only five of these RCTs reported improvements in both adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common intervention characteristics were apparent. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence or clinical outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Across the body of evidence, effects were inconsistent from study to study, and only a minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. Current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. The research in this field needs advances, including improved design of feasible long-term interventions, objective adherence measures, and sufficient study power to detect improvements in patient-important clinical outcomes. By making our comprehensive database available for sharing we hope to contribute to achieving these advances.</P>

<P>Low patient adherence is a major barrier to realizing the benefits of medications that have been shown to do more good than harm in clinical trials. Such trials are typically done among patients who are volunteers, and who are followed closely to assure high adherence. Benefits are greatly reduced or nullified in usual clinical practice where adherence rates are low. Interventions to improve adherence have the potential to multiply benefits for patients, but at the time of our previous review, <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>, no method of helping patients to follow self administered long-term treatments had been proven effective, actionable, and affordable in usual care settings.</P>
<P>Many patients stop taking their medication in the first months following initiation, often without informing their provider, with further attrition over time. In addition, many patients who continue their medication do not consistently take it as prescribed. As a result, adherence rates average around 50% and range from 0% to over 100%, and there is no evidence for substantial change in the past 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gialamas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gialamas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naderi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naderi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Medication non-adherence is often defined as taking less than 80% of prescribed doses, although it has to be noted that non-adherence can also include taking too many doses, and it is associated with an increased risk for poor health, adverse clinical events, and mortality. Thus many people who could benefit from medications do not, and much of the public and private investment in health research and health care is undermined. To make matters worse, low adherence, even to placebo, is independently associated with an increased risk of death ('healthy adherer' effect) (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2006</LINK>). Therefore, enhancing medication adherence is a priority and could improve patient outcomes, primarily through the effect of medications, but also possibly through the overall 'healthy adherer' effect.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our most recent update (search until January 2007) of this Cochrane review included 78 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had &#8805; 80% follow-up and tested the effect of adherence interventions on both adherence and clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). We believe it is essential to have measures of both adherence and clinical outcomes, as ethical standards for adherence research dictate that attempts to improve adherence should be judged by their clinical benefits (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1982</LINK>). Studies that measure only adherence cannot show that patients are better off as a result, and studies that measure only clinical outcomes cannot verify that effects on adherence were important to achieving these outcomes.</P>
<P>Further, we described findings across disease conditions, as the clinical condition is not a major determinant of medication adherence, with the exception of psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979a</LINK>). Do note that studies targeting adherence for medications to treat psychiatric disorders are included in our review.</P>
<P>Our 2008 update found, besides the expected variety in medical conditions and regimens, a large diversity and complexity of interventions and of measures for adherence and patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). Although some intervention types tended to improve adherence, no specific recommendations could be given, especially since high-quality evidence for consistent effects on both adherence and patient outcomes was lacking.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With increasing numbers of efficacious self administered treatments being available, the need for effective interventions to improve adherence is ever more apparent. In recent years, research efforts to better understand the multifactorial barriers that influence patient adherence and to refine theoretical frameworks have been increasing. However, whether these efforts have led to the emergence of more effective interventions needs to be assessed by summarizing the high-quality RCT evidence to date. Many systematic reviews have been published after our 2008 update, but all focused on a specific (demographic, disease, or medication) population, intervention, or on an even more specific combination of both. Generally, these reviews reported similar conclusions: some intervention components are potentially effective, but small sample sizes and suboptimal methodology often prevented strong conclusions; the variety of adherence measures limited study comparability; and most studies lacked a theoretical underpinning (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dulmen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dulmen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering the substantial efforts in adherence research since 2007, and inconclusive evidence from other recent systematic reviews, we have updated our comprehensive systematic review. Based on publication rates over time in the previous review update, we predicted that we would find at least 50 additional RCTs, and thereby potentially improve our confidence for specific conclusions and recommendations.</P>

<P>This systematic review is an update of the review by Haynes et al (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>), which searched for studies until February 2007. As of 24 November 2013, no other comprehensive adherence reviews were registered in the Cochrane Database or PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (<A HREF="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/">http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/</A>). We used a web-based database management system, developed by the Health Information Research Unit at McMaster University, to facilitate screening, data extraction, adjudication of disagreements, author review and confirmation of data, production of data tables, and production of data files for future research use. This system has been successfully used in conducting and completing several large, complex systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies for this review were included if they were RCTs that provided unconfounded tests of interventions expected to affect adherence. A confounder is a characteristic that is extraneous to the primary question being addressed in the study, but which can influence the outcome and is unequally distributed between the groups being compared in the trial. For example, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Colcher-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Colcher 1972</LINK>), two groups received the same prescription for phenoxymethyl penicillin, but different instructions, providing an unconfounded comparison for the instructions, but a third group in the same trial received a different drug (penicillin G benzathine) by a different route (intramuscularly) with a different dose (1.2 million units) and schedule (one dose), making it impossible to separate out independent adherence effects of this regimen. Thus, only the unconfounded comparison of instructions for phenoxymethyl penicillin was included in the review.</P>

<P>We included studies if they reported at least one medication adherence measure and at least one clinical outcome. Regarding follow-up completion, studies needed to have at least 80% follow-up at the end of the recommended treatment period for short-term treatments, and at least 80% follow-up during at least six months for long-term treatments with initially positive results. For long-term regimens, we included negative trials with less than six months follow-up and at least 80% data completion on the grounds that initial failure is unlikely to be followed by success (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). The 80% data completion was required for both adherence and clinical outcomes, and for any outcome other than mortality, the denominator for determining data completion excluded those patients who died before the outcome assessment.</P>

We completed database searches for relevant articles on 11 January 2013, updating previous searches that were undertaken on: 1 September 1993; 12 December 1993; 1 June 1994; 30 June 1995; 28 February 1997; 31 July 1998; 15 August 2001; 30 September 2004; and 1 February 2007. We searched new publications since 1 January 2007, that is, having a one-month overlap with the previous search. All databases were originally searched from their start date.</P>
<P>The search filters for each database, and from the current and previous update, are shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. We checked articles cited in reviews and original studies of patient adherence. We contacted authors of included RCTs to identify additional studies.</P>
<P>We re-assessed all RCTs included in the 2008 update for eligibility to carry over into the current update. Retrieved citations from the updated search entered a first screening stage. Based on the title and abstract, studies moved to the second screening stage if they met all five eligibility criteria or if there was uncertainty about their eligibility. In the second screening stage, assessment of the full text determined if studies were included in the review. At both screening stages, two independent review authors assessed eligibility, and an adjudicator resolved disagreements. We recorded reasons for excluding citations in the second screening stage.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We imported data from the 2008 review into the update database, and checked the data for accuracy. Extracted data included items as provided in the tables from the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>): the 'Characteristics of included studies' table (i.e. methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, additional notes pertaining to any one of the aforementioned items, detailed assessment of risk of bias), and the 'Adherence and outcome' table (i.e. clinical problem, intervention, control, effect on adherence outcome, effect on clinical outcome). We extracted the same items for new included studies. In addition, we extracted items from the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for all included studies from the previous and current update (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two review authors independently extracted all new data, and an adjudicator resolved disagreements. We contacted primary or corresponding authors of all included RCTs to confirm extracted data and provide missing data.</P>
<P>We quantified review author agreement on study 'Risk of bias' criteria using the unweighted Cohen's kappa (k) coefficient (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>). We carried out all analyses using SPSS, version 20.0. When reporting results from individual studies, we cited the measures of association and P values reported in the studies. We interpreted P value &lt; 0.05 as indicating statistical significance. Due to the extreme heterogeneity in clinical conditions, participant selection criteria, medical regimens, interventions, adherence measures, and clinical outcome measures, pooling results according to any of these characteristics would still leave highly heterogeneous groups. In support of this, we refer to the meta-analysis reported by the Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance (ABC) project team, which exclusively focused on RCTs that measured adherence by means of electronic medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) and still found a very high heterogeneity of effects (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 98.88%) (<LINK REF="REF-ABC-Project-Team-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABC Project Team 2012</LINK>). Pooling of effects in our review was further undermined by the frequent use of complex interventions, which was already problematic for categorizing intervention types in the previous update. Studies also had very heterogeneous clinical outcomes; they also often lacked clearly defined primary outcomes. We could not justify even plotting intervention effects without pooling in meta-analysis, as this would imply some degree of comparability among the studies. Rather, as a best case alternative, we conducted a narrative analysis of the studies with the lowest risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), for study design (random sequence generation and concealment of allocation), and for their primary clinical outcome (blinding of outcome assessor, as relevant for the outcome in question). We did not require low risk of bias for the primary adherence measure, as this would have resulted in discussion of very few studies, as most adherence measures have a high or uncertain risk of bias, notably because of lack of blinding.</P>
<P>We reported intervention effects in individual RCTs for all outcomes for a) adherence and b) clinical outcomes. We reported effects in the RCTs identified as low risk of bias as described by the authors, with a focus on the primary outcomes, and with comments on methodological issues that might have influenced results, such as absence of correction for multiple comparisons. We considered adherence and clinical outcomes to be the primary outcome if they were:</P>

<P>The previous update included 78 RCTs, of which 73 were carried over into the current update. We excluded five previously included RCTs: in the course of this review update, we identified that two did not address self administered medication (<LINK REF="STD-Canto-De-Cetina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Canto De Cetina 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ran-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ran 2003</LINK>), one had less than 80% follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Servellen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van Servellen 2005</LINK>), one reported no data for clinical outcome (<LINK REF="STD-van-Es--2001" TYPE="STUDY">van Es 2001</LINK>), and one was confounded (<LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK>). Therefore, we included a total of 182 RCTs in the current update. The overall number of RCT participants was 46,962. However, this overall number does not reflect the strength of the evidence base, considering that we could not meaningfully combine results of included studies. The newly added studies represent a growth in the knowledge base of 150% in the past six years, with more than twice the number of trials than we had predicted based on publication rates in the 2008 review.</P>

<P>Of all included RCTs, 17 had a low risk of bias for both the study design (random sequence generation and concealment of allocation) and the primary clinical outcome (blinding of outcome assessor, as relevant for the outcome).

<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2012</LINK> randomized 127 patients with newly diagnosed ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma to an individually tailored adherence intervention or care as usual. The intervention was delivered by a glaucoma trained nurse with an initial session to assess patient needs, beliefs, and potential solutions, and to devise a one-year individualized care plan that involved education, training, liaising with and training for informal caregivers and professional health care providers, and planning approximately five face-to-face or phone follow-up contacts with the nurse for reassessment. From 12 to 24 months follow-up no intervention was provided and both groups had usual care. The intervention group had a higher proportion of patients with 100% refill adherence (70% versus 43%; P value = 0.002) as measured by low risk of bias practitioner and pharmacist report at 12 months. Intraocular pressure values and changes in management were recorded from routine medical care charts. The mean intraocular pressure, and fluctuations in ocular pressure and changes in management, were not different at 12 months. At 24 months, adherence was not measured. The mean intraocular pressure was almost identical in the two groups, but the fluctuation of intraocular pressure was higher and changes in management more frequent in the control group. It is possible that the differences at 24 months were found due to chance, especially as it is unlikely that a significant effect would be observed one year after stopping the intervention, while no effect was observed after one year of intensive intervention.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2012</LINK> sent seven informational mailings addressing osteoporosis to 2097 low-income older adults who were initiating osteoporosis medication, and randomized them to receive eight phone counseling sessions by health educators using motivational interviewing techniques to promote adherence, or the mailings alone. The phone counseling intervention did not significantly improve the primary outcome, adherence as measured by the median medication possession ratio using low risk of bias pharmacy claims data. Further, secondary outcomes including medication persistence, and proportions with self reported fractures or falls were not improved. The authors indicated that the 113-day time lag between identifying persons initiating therapy in the database and making the first phone call in the intervention group was a missed opportunity, since many eligible or recruited persons had already stopped therapy before the first call.</P>

Counseling sessions, which followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes, had no significant effect on the proportion of participants who achieved adherence &#8805; 80% or &#8805; 95%, as determined using low risk of bias pill counts at pharmacy refill visits, but resulted in a lower hazard rate of viral failure.

<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1976</LINK> randomly allocated, through the minimization method, 38 patients who were both hypertensive and non-adherent (less than 80% of prescribed pills) at the end of a six-month trial to an intensive adherence intervention or control. The intervention included care provided at the work site, special pill containers, counseling, reminders, self monitoring of adherence and blood pressure, support groups, feedback and reinforcement for adequate adherence and blood pressure-lowering, all administered with bi-weekly contacts by a lay program co-ordinator who was supported from study funds. At six months follow-up, there was a significantly higher adherence in the intervention group, as measured by low risk of bias unobtrusive home pill count. The change in diastolic blood pressure after six months was not statistically significantly different between groups (difference in change 3.5 mm Hg; P value = 0.12), although the small sample size might have meant insufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference. The authors discussed the possibility that simply the increased attention for intervention patients could have contributed to the improved adherence, rather than the specific intervention components. It has to be noted that medical therapy for intervention patients was more often intensified at the end of the study, while the intervention co-ordinator was not allowed to contact treating physicians.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2012</LINK> tested whether an average of 5.6 months of multi-systemic therapy (MST), a highly intensive, home-based, tailored family intervention, improved treatment adherence and HbA1c levels compared with weekly phone support during 4.9 months, among 146 poorly controlled adolescent diabetics (mean HbA1c = 11.7%, where good control would be an A1c of 7% for most patients). In MST, therapists were expected to meet with families, their related contacts (e.g. extended family, physicians, and school personnel), or both, a minimum of two times per week at the beginning of treatment with an option for a reduced number of sessions at the end of treatment based on family progress toward treatment goals. Treatment was planned to last for approximately six months. All participants in the trial received standard medical care in addition to MST or telephone support. At seven and 12 months follow-up, the intervention lowered HbA1c and improved adherence (Diabetes Management Scale) as reported by the parent, but not as reported by the adolescent. As the authors acknowledged, it has to be evaluated whether such an intensive intervention is cost-effective, especially as the difference in improvements in HbA1c were relatively small (e.g. A1c -0.74%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48% to -0.01%, at 12 months) in view of the poor control at baseline (A1c 11.7%).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Farooq-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Farooq 2011</LINK> randomized 110 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive family supervised treatment (STOPS) or care as usual. In addition to usual care, participants in the STOPS arm each had a key care supervisor, defined as any family member living with the individual for at least six months and providing support for the treatment as identified by the participant. Education was provided to the key care supervisor about the nature of the illness, misconceptions about treatment, the relationship between supernatural and biological causes of illness (some people believing in supernatural causes might think they cannot do anything about the disease), and the importance of continuing the medication, as well as basic skills in how to administer and supervise the medication. It was emphasized that participants should not be antagonized and violence should never be used in case of refusal to accept the treatment. Steps involved in collecting medicine from the treatment center, storage at home, administering tablets and their ingestion by the participant and how to confirm this were demonstrated. Intervention participants also received free medicines while control group members were left to their own means to obtain their medications. The proportion of patients with perfect adherence, as measured by a five-point self report scale supplemented by pill count data, was higher at three and 12 months in the intervention group, but not at six months. Supervised therapy also improved symptoms as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale. However, it was unclear to what extent free provision of medication in the intervention group for the study contributed to the effect, since control patients could only apply for free drugs through a regular care process (not for the study), if eligible.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Morgado-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Morgado 2011</LINK> randomized 197 patients with arterial hypertension, who had been on antihypertensive therapy for at least six months, to receive either counseling from a hospital pharmacist at a specialized outpatient clinic, or regular care at a traditional hospital clinic without a hospital pharmacist. Hospital pharmacists interviewed patients, assessed problems with blood pressure control, educated patients, advised physicians on medication changes, and provided intervention patients with written educational material. Patients in the intervention group were also encouraged to bring all empty blisters and boxes of antihypertensive medication to clinic visits for recycling and to verify compliance with therapy. The intervention improved the primary outcome of proportion of patients with blood pressure controlled to target, and reduced the proportion of patients with low medication adherence as measured by a five-item questionnaire. The medical therapy advice from pharmacists to physicians might have contributed to the improved blood pressure control in addition to the improved adherence, although the authors report that there were no marked differences compared with the control group regarding therapy changes.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2010</LINK> randomized 538 patients newly initiating antiretroviral therapy, and who had access to a mobile phone and, if required, a partner able to read educational materials, to receive interactive short message service (SMS) or care as usual. Patients in the intervention group received a short education session on the intervention from clinicians, received an SMS every Monday asking "How are you?", and were required to respond within 48 hours to indicate that everything was fine or they had a problem. In case of no response within 48 hours or an indicated problem, the clinician called the patient. The intervention was based on existing mobile phone services and SMS messages were sent by available nurses or clinical officers; no personnel or SMS credits were provided specifically for the study. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention improved the proportion of patients with self reported adherence greater than 95% as well as viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml). Of note, the intervention was reported to function well during a period of political turmoil and population displacement, directing patients to alternative health resources using interactive SMS.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Martins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2009</LINK> randomized 270 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis from urban community clinics in Timor-Leste, which had a well-functioning tuberculosis treatment program including direct observation of medication taking, to receive the intervention with supplementary food or nutritional advice only. Intervention patients were required to attend the clinic daily for routine tuberculosis treatment, and additionally were offered nutritious daily meals at the clinic during the first eight weeks with direct observation of consumption by clinic personnel, and received daily meal packages to take home during weeks 9 to 32. Control group patients were also required to attend the clinic daily for routine care, and additionally received advice regarding a nutritious diet, but did not receive food. The intervention did not improve the primary outcome of proportion of patients completing treatment (sputum clearance) or completion of eight months of treatment, nor did it improve medication adherence or clinical symptoms including cough. The significant weight gain in the intervention group could be beneficial for the tuberculosis patient group, but was not achieved through better medication adherence and therefore not pertinent to the research question of this review. Of note, a civil conflict arose during the last months of the study, which caused displacement of a large population and complicated adequate completion of the study.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2009</LINK> randomized 226 HIV-positive patients initiating or switching to a new antiretroviral medication in a factorial design to either peer support, pager messaging, both peer support and paper messaging, or care as usual only. Regarding peer support, clinic staff selected peer supporters who were also HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy, and had a high therapy adherence, regularly attended clinic visits, were socially skilled, and were able to participate in training and supervision. Peers were, as much as possible, matched to participants based on race/ethnicity, sex, and sexual orientation. During three months, aiming to use twice-monthly group meetings and thrice-weekly phone calls, peer supporters addressed barriers to medication adherence and potential solutions. Patients could choose to continue attending meetings and seeking assistance after three months. The three months pager intervention involved automated individually tailored interactive messaging, addressing medication adherence, education, entertainment, and adherence measurement. Messaging frequency could be tailored to the patient's preference with a minimum of three daily messages in the first two months, which was tapered in the third month. At three months, the only significant effect was for self reported adherence in the peer support group, compared with care as usual. No effects were found of either peer support or the pager intervention on self reported adherence, electronically monitored adherence, and viral load and CD4 count as reported in routine medical charts, at six and nine months. The one significant effect was likely a chance finding, considering the testing of multiple outcomes at different time points and the absence of confirmation by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). The authors discussed that the lack of an effect could be related to the poor use of the intervention by participants, the high quality of usual care in this HIV-specialized clinic, and the inclusion of all patients on therapy rather than those with adherence problems only.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2007</LINK> randomized 136 HIV-positive patients with prescribed antiretroviral therapy to receive a peer-led social support intervention or standard care. The three months peer support intervention was of similar design to the intervention for <LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2009</LINK>, with the difference that in the present study patients could not choose to continue attending meetings and seeking assistance after three months. The intervention did not improve adherence as measured by self report and MEMS, nor did it lower HIV-1 RNA viral load values as routinely reported in medical charts, at three and six months follow-up. The authors discussed the possibility that the lack of an effect could relate to the poor use of the intervention by participants due to multiple barriers&#8212;including poverty, substance abuse, and insufficient time to establish trust between patient and peer supporter&#8212;limiting consistent attendance at meetings and receiving phone calls for adherence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2006</LINK> tested the effect on adherence and mortality of pharmacist phone counseling, addressing medication adherence, lifestyle, and the next follow-up visit, versus usual care, among non-adherent stable patients on five or more chronic medications. Of 442 randomized patients, 236 had become adherent since screening. Adherence was measured by pharmacists using a structured questionnaire in combination with medication dispensing information: taking 80% to 120% of prescribed pills was considered adherent. A proportion of all medications for which the patient was adherent was calculated, but it was unclear how this was used since the authors only distinguished adherent and non-adherent. After receiving six to eight pharmacist calls during two years, the intervention group had fewer baseline non-adherent patients who remained non-adherent, and more baseline adherent patients who remained adherent. The phone counseling intervention also reduced the risk of all-cause mortality from 18% to 11% (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.97; P value = 0.039). Considering that mortality is hard to improve solely with an adherence intervention, and the confidence interval for the relative risk is wide, this result needs to be replicated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK> randomized 60 HIV patients, who were stable on a combination of at least three antiretroviral medications and had a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml, to a cognitive behavioral intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention group were given contact information for a psychotherapist, and asked to schedule a first appointment. The psychotherapist and patient determined a visit schedule for the year, with a minimum of two sessions and maximum of 25 (median was 11). In addition, they would identify at least two treatment goals, of which medication adherence was one, which would be targeted with treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. The proportion of patients with adherence of 95% or greater as measured by MEMS, and self reported adherence as measured on a visual analog scale, was higher in the intervention group at 10 to 12 months, but the regression coefficients for change in MEMS adherence during the study were not different between intervention and control. Viral load and CD4 count were not different between groups, but the intervention group showed an improvement in mental state, as measured by a standardized questionnaire on experience and behavior. This study was designed as a feasibility study, with no reported sample size calculation, and it is unclear to what extent the study was powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes, or if significant effects would remain after correction for multiple comparisons.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Laporte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Laporte 2003</LINK> randomized 86 patients who were hospitalized for a thromboembolic disease and needed oral anticoagulation for at least three months, to either intensive education or standard education on anticoagulation. Patients in the intervention group received visual educational material, daily visits from healthcare providers, and daily tests on their education for the duration of the hospitalization, all aimed at the importance of medication adherence and causes of anticoagulation instability. Control group patients received standard education without any of these features for the entire duration of hospitalization. Following discharge, no differences were found regarding correct bottle openings, timing of bottle openings or pill count, all measured using MEMS. In addition, no differences were found regarding the clinical effect of anticoagulants, e.g. proportion of values or the proportion of days the INR (international normalized ratio) values were within the therapeutic target range. The study used a factorial design and also randomized patients to anticoagulation with either warfarin or acenocoumarol, but these medication groups did not differ regarding adherence and no statistical interaction was found between the medication and educational interventions.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK> randomized 335 patients with dyspepsia and confirmed <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> infection, who were prescribed seven-day treatment with omeprazole, bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline hydrochloride, to either an intensive pharmacist counseling intervention or regular pharmacist counseling. Intervention patients received a detailed 15-minute pharmacist counseling session at the start of therapy, addressing side effects, the importance of completing therapy, potential barriers and coping strategies related to adherence, and encouragement to call the pharmacist in case of problems, as well as a standard phone call by the pharmacist after two to three days. Patients in the control group received a standard five-minute pharmacist counseling session at therapy initiation, describing the proper protocol to take the medication and providing an opportunity to ask questions. Self reported medication adherence and <I>Helicobacter pylori </I>eradication rate, as measured by carbon<SUP>14</SUP> urea breath test, were not different between the intervention and control groups at three months. The authors indicated that the lack of an effect could relate to enrolment of motivated patients who were doing well at baseline, the use of daily blister packs in all patients, which might have enhanced adherence, or spill-over of the intervention to the control group due to the same pharmacists applying the two treatments, both of which included counseling.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Nazareth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nazareth 2001</LINK> randomized 362 hospitalized patients over 75 years, who were taking more than four medications at discharge, to either an intensive or a standard pharmacist discharge plan. Patients in the intervention group received an assessment by a hospital pharmacist, who evaluated therapy appropriateness and the patient's ability to manage the medications, and educated patients on appropriate adherence and how to liaise with important healthcare providers. An individualized discharge plan was devised containing the patient's medications and required adherence support, and copies were given to the patient and an assigned community pharmacist, family physician and other involved providers. After 7 to 14 days the community pharmacist visited the patient at home to reassess therapy adherence and barriers, and intervene and schedule additional follow-up visits as deemed appropriate. Control group patients received standard discharge procedures by a hospital pharmacist, including a letter to the family physician. No differences were found at three and six months for hospital readmission, death, outpatient clinic visits, and family physician visits, nor for self reported measures including general well-being, satisfaction, adherence, medication knowledge, and medication hoarding. This study included old and high-risk patients, of whom 11% had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 15 or less at baseline and 15% died during six months, leaving 74% of participants for interview on self reported measures at six months.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Walley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Walley 2001</LINK> tested the effect of direct observation of therapy, and randomized 497 new sputum-positive tuberculosis patients to one of three arms: 1) direct observation by health workers six days per week during two months, 2) direct observation by family members, 3) self administered therapy, obtained by bi-weekly visits to a health facility. At seven to eight months, both direct observation intervention groups had comparable rates to the control group for the outcomes of cure (sputum-negative on two most recent occasions) and cure or treatment completion (no smear results on at least two occasions, but treatment completed). The authors indicated that the lack of an effect might be due to challenges such as the high rate of patients not being able to comply with direct observation of therapy by health workers, and the implementation of interventions for this study on top of a recently strengthened tuberculosis care system.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current review updated our 2008 version, <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>, with 109 new RCTs, a substantially larger number than expected from previous publication rates. To our knowledge this is the only comprehensive (not restricted to specific settings, medications, or diseases) systematic review of interventions to improve medication adherence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed both adherence and clinical outcomes. Despite the more than two-fold increase in the knowledge base, the interventions and findings of these RCTs only slightly alter the conclusions of the previous version of our review. Compared with the previous update, we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence among studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) no longer try to classify studies according to intervention type; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses. The wide variety of settings, participants, intervention types, medications, adherence measures, and clinical outcomes precluded summarizing findings to reach reliable general conclusions. RCTs included in the current review reported effects that were inconsistent from study to study. A minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs reported improving both adherence and clinical outcome, but these typically had very complex interventions that would be difficult to implement in usual practice setting. Thus, as a qualitative generalization, methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems tested to date are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. Therefore, the quest for effective and practical interventions to promote medication adherence and improve clinical outcomes must continue. In acknowledgement of the need for collective advancement, we make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses.</P>
<P>To the extent that they represent true innovation, the increase of trials is most encouraging. Even when outcomes were improved, however, the effects were generally small. Effects were seldom assessed on major clinical events such as death or hospitalization, and when done these were rarely significant, albeit possibly due to insufficient study power. The diversity, complexity, and uncertain effects of the interventions, as well as the often uncertain risk of bias for blinding treatment allocation and outcomes assessment, make generalizations about which interventions work and which do not problematic.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-09 04:56:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our narrative focused on the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias, to provide a reasonable sampling of the details and diversity of included trials. We identified only 17 studies as having a low risk of bias for study design and clinical outcome assessment. Their interventions were generally complex, trying to overcome multiple barriers to adherence by several means of tailored ongoing support. The lowest risk of bias RCTs primarily involved enhanced support from family, peers, or allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals), and/or daily treatment support. Of these RCTs, five improved both adherence and clinical outcomes, three improved only adherence outcomes, one improved only clinical outcomes, and eight did not improve adherence or clinical outcomes. This was a similar success rate to that found in the 21 newly included studies in the 2008 update (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). Whether these numbers reflect the actual proportion of studies that had an important effect is uncertain, and simple 'vote counting' is not informative because:</P>
<OL>
<LI>a large variety of often complex interventions would be inappropriately treated as equal;</LI>
<LI>many studies tested multiple outcomes without statistical correction, thereby increasing the risk of false positives findings;</LI>
<LI>many studies were underpowered thereby potentially hiding a true effect;</LI>
<LI>most outcomes were surrogate measures (e.g. blood pressure) rather than patient-important outcomes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>No common intervention characteristics for success were apparent among these studies. Therefore, even in the studies with the strongest methodology, no consistent evidence exists that medication adherence can be improved within the resources usually available in clinical settings, and that this will predictably lead to important improvements in treatment outcomes. The results might have been different with more relaxed criteria for participant loss to follow-up, but this would further muddy the water with even lower-quality RCTs, and we prefer to stand by our criteria of at least 80% follow-up in all treatment groups. In addition, most studies enrolled patients who were willing to participate, rather than those that had low adherence. This makes it harder to show an effect, as opposed to applying the intervention only to those in need of adherence support. Although we were not able to assess potential publication bias, as we did not pool results, we estimate that some publication bias is likely due to the widespread lack of power to pick up potentially meaningful effects. If so, our low estimate of the benefits of interventions to date would likely only be reinforced by unpublished studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">New developments</HEADING>
<P>Since the last update, some new or little studied intervention types have been reported. Although the technologies have been around for a while, we were now able to include several RCTs testing the effect of mobile text messages (<LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zolfaghari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zolfaghari 2012</LINK>), and remote internet-based treatment support (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meer 2009</LINK>). Of the five RCTs testing the effect of mobile text messages, two were included in the lowest risk of bias group. Only <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2010</LINK> showed a significant effect, on antiretroviral therapy adherence and the clinical outcome of viral load in HIV patients. There may be potential to build on the opportunities provided by text messaging, including in low-resource settings. <LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2009</LINK> also targeted HIV patients, but did not show an effect of pager messages on adherence or viral load. The remaining three RCTs testing mobile text messages for oral contraceptives, acne therapy, and diabetes were not included in the lowest risk of bias group, and none had an effect on both adherence and the clinical outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zolfaghari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zolfaghari 2012</LINK>). Further, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>, a study not included in the lowest risk of bias group, tested internet-based asthma telemonitoring for patients of 6 to 17 years, but found no effect on adherence or clinical outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meer 2009</LINK> tested internet-based asthma self management plus education among adults, whereby communication could also be done using mobile text messaging if preferred, and found no improvement in medication adherence, only moderate improvements in asthma control and lung function, and no clinically significant improvements in asthma-related quality of life and exacerbations. Further, no other RCTs testing the effect of internet-based disease telemonitoring made it through our selection process. Although both technologies have great potential to reach large population groups to improve adherence, further rigorous testing is necessary. Ongoing studies might strengthen the knowledge base and provide more details on how they could be better utilized. The present examples overall do not change our conclusion from the previous update that adherence research is lagging behind the rapid developments in technology, and that research methodology and evidence on their optimal use remain weak.</P>
<P>Allied healthcare providers such as nurses and pharmacists are increasingly delivering part of, or the entire intervention. In our previous update we advised further exploration of their role, and hypothesized that if their roles can be expanded to include counseling patients to enhance medication adherence, this may be feasible in practice. Considering that physicians have limited time, and sometimes skills, to counsel patients on medication adherence repeatedly, shifting these tasks to allied providers seems reasonable and potentially cost-effective. Several complex interventions involving allied providers were effective, but since they were often only part of the intervention and delivered a variety of intervention enhancing services, their efficacy has to be determined for specific roles and tasks. In addition to the role of allied health professionals, several studies tested family/social interventions, lay health mentoring, or group meetings. It seems worthwhile to explore further involving non-professional personnel, since the patient's social context is important to optimize chronic care, and might improve cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>As mentioned, complex interventions were often used in the new RCTs, typically involving intensive ongoing allied health care provider and social support, sometimes facilitating transitions in care. This seems logical considering that adherence is generally a complicated matter caused by multi-factorial barriers (<LINK REF="REF-ABC-Project-Team-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABC Project Team 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kardas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kardas 2013</LINK>), but also raises three primary concerns:</P>
<OL>
<LI>complex interventions are usually compared with care as usual, while it remains to be seen if they are more effective than a simple intervention;</LI>
<LI>if effective, the entire complex intervention should be implementable in other settings, without requirement of excessive additional personnel and costs (implementation flexibility and external validity); and</LI>
<LI>if the latter is not feasible, the effects of individual components should be teased out, such as by a factorial design, in order to be able to determine if all components were required or to select the most effective ones.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Related to complexity, many RCTs used personnel and resources supported by research funds. For example, pharmacists would be specifically allocated to the intervention and reimbursed accordingly, but outside this research setting they might not be able or willing to dedicate this time to the intervention. Even if a small effect on clinical outcomes was observed, it remains to be seen whether such interventions can be translated to other settings in a cost-effective manner. Regarding this, few adequate full cost-effectiveness evaluations of adherence RCTs are being published (<LINK REF="REF-Oberje-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberje 2013</LINK>). These will be needed if clinically important effects are documented.</P>
<P>Process evaluation of an effective complex intervention can be very useful to hypothesize which components were most effective and to identify individual or contextual barriers and facilitators to adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>). However, we believe that this eventually requires direct comparison in an RCT, compared with usual care or a simple intervention. Two RCTs in the lowest risk of bias group, <LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2011</LINK>, applied two different adherence interventions in a factorial design. This design allows testing of the separate effects of multiple intervention components, while also observing their additive effect. This will better inform which components are independently effective, or whether an effect is due to the combination of two components that individually might not be (very) effective. It has to be noted that to be able to test several components and their interactions with sufficient power, the required sample size has to be increased accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of note, the European Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance project published its final report in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Demonceau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demonceau 2013</LINK>), which also included a comprehensive systematic review including intervention RCTs assessing adherence outcome by means of electronically compiled measures. The authors used a taxonomy to label intervention components and tried to tease out the effect of each component, although they acknowledged that many interventions were complex, highly variable, and not easily summarized. Of the 65 included RCTs, 32 also assessed clinical outcome, with only four showing an effect on clinical outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Promising interventions not included in our review</HEADING>
<P>There are likely many potential areas for which interventions are either in development or lacked high-quality RCT evidence with adherence and clinical outcomes at the time of our search. We will illustrate this with a selected example regarding cardiovascular prevention single-pill combination therapies, also since a recent Cochrane systematic review by Ryan et al showed promise for simplified dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2014</LINK>). Several of these combination pills, containing multiple proven cardiovascular medications, have already been developed and tested versus the same medications as individual therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Working-Group-on-the-Summit-of-Combination-Therapy" TYPE="REFERENCE">Working Group on the Summit of Combination Therapy</LINK>). These pills simplify therapy to only one pill per day, where most cardiovascular patients currently have to take at least four to five separate pills daily. The RCTs testing combination pills typically assessed effects on therapy persistence (e.g. not explicitly discontinuing), rather than daily pill adherence while still on medications, in addition to intermediate clinical outcomes such as blood pressure. However, an RCT published after our search showed that self reported adherence as well as intermediate clinical outcomes (blood pressure, lipid levels) were somewhat improved with a cardiovascular combination pill (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2013</LINK>). That said, medication was provided free to the combination pill intervention group, while control group participants had to fend for themselves in acquiring their medications (almost half lacked insurance coverage), leaving uncertainty as to whether the improved adherence was due to simplified therapy or facilitated access to medication and cost-lowering. This study would be a candidate to make it into our next update, but the provision of polypills free of charge constitutes a more complex intervention than the authors highlighted. As a related example, in our previous review we indicated that there is some evidence that a dose frequency of one to two times per day may be associated with better adherence than three to four times per day, and advised better exploration of this dose frequency. None of the new RCTs with the lowest risk of bias addressed this issue, and we would like to highlight this important issue.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Measuring adherence and clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>To determine applicability to patient care, we only selected studies that measured both adherence and treatment outcome. This requirement has received the criticism that this resulted in a more negative message than some would like to see. It has been suggested that the findings would be more upbeat and positive if we included studies that measured only adherence. This criticism does not pertain to the purpose of this review, that is, to determine whether adherence interventions make a difference to clinical outcomes. It simply cannot be assumed that measures to increase adherence do more good than harm, even if they increase adherence. Nevertheless, we do agree that investigators who seek to advance the methods for enhancing adherence may find promising leads from studies that do not meet our criteria for measurement of both adherence and clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>Attempts to increase adherence can have adverse effects (loss of privacy and autonomy, increased adverse effects of treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2006</LINK>), and so on. Few RCTs assessed such potential adverse effects. Further, many interventions with an effect on adherence and surrogate clinical outcomes measured relatively short-term outcomes, typically at 6 to 12 months, which does not mean that their effect would be sustained or that they would lead to important clinical outcomes in the long run.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adherence measures</HEADING>
<P>A well-known problem with adherence studies is the inability to measure adherence accurately and reliably, making it harder to pick up true differences, which could have contributed to the variable effects we observed among RCTs. Most studies used patient self report measures, which are known to overestimate adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Gordis-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordis 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1993</LINK>); these studies are at especially high risk of bias when the patient is not blinded to the treatment allocation, which is usually the case. Some validated questionnaires are available, and should be used as much as possible if self report is chosen, but their accuracy and reliability are often limited and depend on the context they are used in.</P>
<P>Increasingly, studies are using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) pill bottle caps. These caps contain a microchip that measures the date and time at which the bottles are opened, but do not register if the patient actually took the medication on those occasions. Although this method is more objective than self report, it could also function as an intervention (patients feel monitored) (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2009</LINK>), and increase adherence in both groups, thus diminishing or concealing a true difference. It can also be 'gamed' by the patient who is aware of the MEMS function and wishes to keep non-adherence private.</P>
<P>A potentially more objective measure that was used in some studies was pill count, which is especially appealing if it is done unannounced, at home, and in an unobtrusive way, in order to prevent patient awareness and anticipation of pill count. However, most pill counts are done on containers that the patient brings with them to a visit to a health professional, and in this circumstance counts can clearly be altered by the patient.</P>
<P>A method that was regularly used, and that probably has the highest likelihood of maintaining blinding of patients and providers, was the use of routine pharmacy refill records. Although this method depends on the assumption that the patient is actually consuming the medication, and the only one doing so, it better allows adequate blinding of outcome assessors. In our view, using more objective measures such as pharmacy records is a productive step forward in the field of adherence research, as it will lead to further valid and reliable results. With electronic records available in most pharmacies, this option is increasingly available, inexpensive, and acceptable, providing that patient consent is obtained.</P>
<P>It is important to note that our review may miss the most severe form of non-adherence, among those who do not attend for needed care or enter trials. Patients dropping out of care are unlikely to be receiving any medication, and if those in care average about 50% adherence, keeping patients in care is arguably the most important adherence intervention at present. The same rationale can be used for keeping patients on medication, even if they do not attend clinic visits. Both assume, however, that for those who are prevented from dropping out or discontinuing medication, or who are returned to care or restart medication by intervention, adherence rates are sufficient to achieve clinically important benefits. This merits further testing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Consistent with the large variety in diseases and medications, many different clinical outcomes were reported. Most RCTs measured intermediate biological outcomes, such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol or HIV-1 RNA, or patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life, knowledge, beliefs, or attitudes. Very few studies examined major, patient-important, clinical endpoints such as death or hospitalization. The latter have the lowest risk of bias, as they are obvious and can easily be verified. Intermediate biological outcomes also often have a low risk of bias, although this could be compromised if measurement methods differ among subjects, and outcome assessors are not blinded. For example, measuring blood pressure requires a protocol whereby a fixed number of measurements are taken according to a standardized process, and a provider who is aware of a participant being in the intervention group might (subconsciously or otherwise) alter this process or interpret readings differently. Self reported outcomes such as symptoms and quality of life are more prone to bias, even if using well-validated general and disease-specific tools to assess them. Finally, many studies reported self reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, often in addition to more objective clinical outcomes. Although these types of outcomes can be used to further clarify mechanisms of effects, they are often not validated or inadequately validated, are prone to self report or observer bias, and their measurement varies with time and clinical care experiences which limits their reliability.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Study power</HEADING>
<P>Many RCTs had inadequate power to detect a meaningful difference in adherence, and this did not seem to be improved among newly identified RCTs. As a general guide, studies with a single intervention group and control group would need to include at least 60 participants per group if they are to have at least 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the proportion of patients judged to have adequate adherence. According to this rule, the new RCTs were as likely to be underpowered (40% (44/109)) as RCTs in the previous update, and even among the 17 lowest risk of bias RCTs in the present update, four had insufficient power (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laporte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Laporte 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farooq-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Farooq 2011</LINK>). For example, in a study of 38 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1976</LINK>), there was a significant increase in adherence associated with the intervention and an interesting within-group reduction of blood pressure within the intervention group. However, the difference between the intervention and control groups for blood pressure change was not statistically significant. Underpowered studies are more likely to miss a meaningful difference in adherence, even when improving adherence substantially, and showing an effect on clinical outcomes is likely even harder. This is especially true for major events. If RCTs with hundreds or thousands of participants are needed to show that the medication has an effect on major outcomes compared with usual care, it is unlikely that improving adherence among patients who are prescribed the medication will have a substantial effect on major outcomes in a small sample size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of reporting</HEADING>
<P>Many articles did not provide sufficient detail to allow the risk of bias to be determined, or for the exact nature of what the study tested to be understood. In particular, details of the methods of random sequence generation, concealment of treatment allocation, and blinding of the outcome assessors as relevant for the outcomes were often not reported, and therefore we could not determine the risk of bias. As a consequence, it is possible that some of RCTs that we excluded from our narrative actually had a low risk of bias, but we were unable to determine this based on the manuscript, supplements, and (absence of) author response. The importance of adequate reporting is further illustrated by the initially included RCTs that were eventually discarded due to less than 80% follow-up after repeated detailed review. The way these studies were reported was sometimes confusing for something as simple as follow-up rate, and the full picture was only revealed after reading all the details, tables, figures, or supplements. Examples appear in the listing of studies excluded for cause in this review.</P>
<P>Treatment arms, both intervention and control, were also not always described in sufficient detail. For example, while the report might state clearly that patients received reminders, the method of administering the reminder program might not be described, or might be described in some part of the text other than the section on the intervention. Most studies paid research staff to administer interventions, raising issues in generalizability to usual practice settings. This also raised the issue of attribution in many studies: if the control group received 'usual care', there would be no 'attention control' in the study and any effects observed could be due to either the intervention proper or simply the non-specific effects of increased attention paid to the intervention group. Furthermore, some studies reported that the patients in the control group received 'usual care', but did not describe what that encompassed. If the standard medical care is already performing relatively well, it will be harder to show an improvement with the intervention. Therefore, to understand the trial results better, it is recommended to provide sufficient details on the intervention design and delivery, the assumed change process the intervention aims to deliver, and the care process for the control group, whether this was an active control or usual care (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Missed studies</HEADING>
<P>Despite extensive searching, we may have missed some trials that met all of our criteria. The literature on patient adherence is not well indexed because the number of studies is quite small relative to the literature published on other topics, and because it is spread across traditional disease boundaries.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study eligibility criteria and 'Risk of bias' assessment</HEADING>
<P>We chose our eligibility criteria to summarize the current best evidence of unconfounded RCTs, with adequate follow-up completion in all treatment groups, assessing the effect on both adherence and clinical outcome. With other eligibility criteria, such as allowing a larger loss to follow-up or not requiring clinical outcome, the review results might have been different. In addition, in the absence of clear study details, we could have made judgment calls in our 'Risk of bias' assessment to avoid too many 'uncertain risk' assignments. This might have resulted in more studies being considered 'low risk', and therefore eligible for discussion in our main text. However, we anticipate that the quality of evidence in these trials would be even lower than the moderate study quality which was found in both the overall review and among the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias, and would lead us further from an accurate overview of the current best evidence in a field with a large number of small and low quality studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other reviews</HEADING>
<P>Our review is restricted to prescribed medications, excluding those prescribed for addiction, and to studies that assessed both adherence and treatment outcomes. There are many other systematic reviews of adherence interventions, too numerous to list, especially for specific clinical conditions, and also for non-medication interventions (e.g. diet, exercise, addictions, and so on). We acknowledge that systematic reviews focusing on specific clinical conditions, medications, or intervention types might draw different conclusions. We chose to focus on all RCTs testing adherence interventions for any self administered therapy, to get a complete overview of the field and to account for the fact that adherence problems are often comparable for different medications. This resulted in the inclusion of a large variety of heterogeneous RCTs that could not reliably be pooled, but we encourage reviewers and researchers who find a signal for effective interventions for a specific condition or medication to share their findings with us and other reviewers. In addition, we invite reviewers interested in specific conditions, medications, or interventions to propose such a specific analysis in our comprehensive database.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among 109 newly identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs), interventions were often complex, involving allied health care providers such as nurses and pharmacists, presumably attempting to overcome multifactorial barriers and to tailor support to individual patient needs. Only 17 RCTs had a low risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment, and clinical outcome assessment; this low number is likely partly due to the fact that there was often insufficient detail provided to determine risk of bias. Among these 17 RCTs, only five improved both adherence and clinical outcome, which is comparable to the rate found among the 21 new RCTs in our previous update. If there is a common thread to these interventions, it is that they are complex and use frequent interaction with patients with a focus on adherence. However, these complex strategies for improving adherence with long-term medication prescriptions are not very effective, despite the amount of effort and other resources they can consume. There is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that newer intervention types, such as mobile text messaging and Internet-based care, can assist in improving adherence. There is no evidence that low adherence can be 'cured'. Thus, effective methods to improve adherence must be maintained for as long as the treatment is needed, requiring interventions that can be integrated into the care system in a cost-effective manner.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:05:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low adherence affects all self administered treatments, and as the numbers of efficacious treatments continue to grow, investments in fundamental and applied adherence research are likely to pay large dividends. It is possible that interventions to date are not very effective since we do not understand in sufficient detail exactly what the adherence problems are. Frameworks to assist in the development of complex interventions therefore advise preparatory qualitative assessments involving patients and other stakeholders, to understand better the problems and context (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the steep increase in number of RCTs, the field of adherence improvement research has persistent methodological weaknesses. Rather than increasing the volume of research while repeating weaknesses, several study methodology issues need to be addressed to ensure that we are not missing any true effects or creating false positive findings. Investigators should make use of best-in-class adherence measures, such as prescription monitoring. More objective measures for adherence are needed to accurately determine intervention effects. Patients should be recruited because their adherence is low, not just because they are willing to participate. Researchers should design studies to minimize risk of bias as much as possible and clearly report their procedures, especially concerning co-interventions, such as additional staff supported by research funds. Another priority is attaining sufficient study power for clinical outcomes that are important to patients. Around 40% of all studies were underpowered, with less than 60 patients per treatment group, and this was a comparable rate to the previous update. Smaller studies may be appropriate until an innovation appears to have clinically useful effects. At that point, the innovation should be tested in more substantial trials to document effects on clinically important outcomes (including adverse effects), feasibility in usual practice settings, and sustainability. If complex interventions show positive effects, it would be appropriate to test their components in factorial studies.</P>
<P>A cure for non-adherence is nowhere to be seen, but treatments that obviate the need for ongoing adherence, such as implantable treatments with minimal adverse effects (e.g. intrauterine devices) could be worth pursuing. Intervention components that could be explored further include well-established and newer information and communication technologies on top of regular care, and specific or co-ordinated roles for allied health professionals.</P>
<P>Finally, it is essential that researchers stop re-inventing the poorly performing 'wheels' of adherence interventions that we have seen to date. It seems that most adherence research is performed by clinicians and others who discover adherence problems while working within the context of the management of a specific disease condition, such as cardiovascular risk, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and the like. Low adherence with medications is a ubiquitous problem, found with self administered treatments for all medical conditions. Without considering what has been studied across disease conditions, researchers will find themselves with inadequate knowledge of what does not work, and will be unable to avoid repeating the painful lessons of adherence research to date. Rather, we need to begin with interventions that have shown some promise, or at least have not been tested with repeatedly negative results. The methods and innovations of adherence research must advance if we are to be able to help patients enjoy the benefits of modern therapeutics.</P>

<P>The study location was Sinawe sexual assault service, Mthatha, South Africa, and Karl Bremer Hospital, Victoria Hospital, and the Simelela Centre; all in Khayelitsha, South Africa</P>
<P>
<BR/>136 participants were randomized to the intervention group and 138 participants were randomized to the control group</P>
<P>
<BR/>The inclusion criteria were women and girl children; girls under 16 years of age were eligible if accompanied by a care giver</P>
<P>
<BR/>The exclusion criteria were rape victims who did not get post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (due to being HIV positive or because they did not take an HIV test), those unable to give consent for reason of severe injury or severe mental distress (including severely distressed guardians), and those who were not contactable telephonically</P>

<P>Intervention: TELEPHONE COUNSELING<BR/>Patients in the intervention group received standard care and telephone counseling sessions. The telephone counseling included 4 calls in the first week, 3 calls in the 2nd and 3rd week, and 2 calls in the last week, but more were made if necessary. The support included the application of basic counseling skills including listening and validating the traumatic events, encouraging participants to take their medication, to seek support from family and friends, to attend formal counseling services, to read the pamphlet, use the diary, and return to the clinic for follow-up medication</P>
<P>Control: STANDARD CARE<BR/>Standard care consisted of psychological containment, medical examination, and collection of forensic evidence; HIV testing with pre- and post-test counseling; providing emergency contraception, treatment of sexually transmitted infections and PEP for HIV. Follow-up was arranged to collect further HIV PEP medication. All patients had an interactive information session to explain the content of the pamphlet, answer questions, and demonstrate initiation of the use of the medication diary. The pamphlet contained specific information about taking PEP after a sexual assault; a diary for the 28-day period on which pill taking was to be marked and contact information on support services. No further contact was made with participants in the control group until the final interview, but they continued to receive standard care from the service</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2014-10-14 13:55:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The measures of adherence were assessed within 5 days of the 28-day treatment period ending in a face to face interview conducted by a fieldworker. Non-adherence was defined as missing 3 or more doses of medication (of 56 doses). Patients who did not return to the facility to collect the full 28 days of medication, or who were found to have more than 3 doses remaining when pills were counted/volume of syrup was assessed, were considered non-adherent. If medication containers were not available at the interview, participants were asked to estimate the number of pills or volume of syrup remaining</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were depressive symptomatology, measured by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, measured 4 weeks after the beginning of treatment (within 4 days of treatment ending). The scale was administered by a fieldworker</P>

<P>Intervention: PHARMACIST CARE INTERVENTION<BR/>For all patients randomized to the intervention group, the research pharmacist had discussions with their physicians regarding drug therapy and, if necessary, treatment modification was recommended, e.g. more intensive management of hypertension or simplification of dosage regimens if deemed appropriate, taking account of the latest American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations. Patients who were randomized to the intervention group were educated on their illness and their medication in a structured fashion, including discussion on risk of diabetes complications, proper dosage, side effects and storage of medications, healthy lifestyle and management of diabetes mellitus signs and symptoms through self monitoring. A printed leaflet to assist with the education program was developed and the patient was given a copy to take home. Supplementary leaflets containing information about hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also given to the patients if they suffered from these conditions. The educational advice was reinforced when patients came to the hospital pharmacy to collect their prescribed medicines on their monthly schedule. In addition, behavioral modification aspects of the Pharmacist Care intervention involved advice on the following: self monitoring of glycemic control (patients were encouraged to monitor their blood glucose levels 3 times per day, to record these values and bring a record book to all subsequent appointments); physical exercise (this involved initiation of an exercise plan that could be incorporated into the patient's daily schedule, after taking into consideration their level of fitness, e.g. 1-hour walk daily; diet (the patient was assisted with the identification of dietary behavior that adversely influences blood glucose control, lipid levels, weight management, and of the times of day when the patient was most vulnerable to overeating, and given improved understanding of the relative effects of certain food choices on blood glucose control); medication adherence (patients were asked about any problems that they had encountered with regard to taking their medication and were offered education and practical help to encourage them to take the medicines prescribed for them by their physician); and smoking cessation (patients were encouraged to stop smoking by advising them about the danger of smoking to health, with emphasis on the increased dangers of smoking in diabetic patients)</P>

<P>Intervention: PROBLEM SOLVING INTERVENTION<BR/>Participants met with a research co-ordinator for 4 sessions of a problem solving (PS) intervention. PS comprised 4 30-minute sessions. The individualized intervention involved 4 interactive steps, usually 1 per research session. For the 158 participants who reported missing doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the goal was to improve adherence. For the 7 participants who declared adherence to the prescribed regimen, the goal was to maintain adherence. The first PS step consisted of defining the problem: improving or preserving adherence to ICS use within the patient's unique context and orientation. Problem orientation facilitated the adoption of a rational, positive, and constructive appraisal of how to achieve adherence, with non-adherence being presented as a problem to be solved. PS was presented as a means of coping with problems more generally and modifying attitudes or beliefs that inhibit or interfere with attempts to solve problems. It was a motivational technique to help the participant view the occurrence of problems as inevitable, normal, and solvable. This first step involved breaking problems into small achievable pieces. The second step was brainstorming for alternative solutions. The third step was choosing the best solution by weighing the consequences, both desirable and undesirable, of each candidate solution. Between the third and fourth meetings, the solution was tried. For the fourth step, the chosen solution was evaluated and revised. As part of this intervention, downloaded data from monitored ICSs were shared with the participant in a nonjudgmental fashion at each visit. At these sessions, subjects followed the same PS steps for addressing an additional problem of their own choosing, such as increasing physical activity. The problems were sometimes interrelated; for example, a father wants to play sports with his child, and improving asthma management makes this easier</P>
<P>Control: ASTHMA EDUCATION<BR/>Patients attended 4 30-minute sessions, conducted by a research co-ordinator. Each session was about an asthma education topic unrelated to self management, adherence, or inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The topics covered, 1 at each session, were the following: (1) the proper technique for using an albuterol rescue metered-dose inhaler and a dry powder inhaler or spacer, depending on the patient's medications; (2) the use of peak flow meters; (3) common asthma triggers; and (4) the pathophysiology of asthma. These sessions did not involve discussion of problem solving or adherence, only didactic presentation of health information</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were electronic monitoring. Date and time of ICS actuation was monitored. The electronic monitor can record multiple actuations over a short time period and thus can detect medication 'dumping', multiple actuations of an ICS unaccompanied by inhalation. Only 2 electronic monitors that measure the time and date of ICS use were available at the time of the study. Although no commercial monitor was available for fluticasone-salmeterol, the most frequent ICS prescribed to subjects during the study period, we were able to use the Diskus Adherence Logger (DAL). Fluticasone and beclomethasone administered by means of metered-dose inhalers were the next most frequently prescribed; for these, we used a commercial monitor, MDILog (Life Link Monitoring, Inc, Kingston, NY). Approximately 90% of study participants were prescribed an ICS that could be monitored with the DAL or MDILog. 14 patients were initially prescribed inhaled mometasone, but they were switched to a medication that could be monitored, fluticasone, during the study period with their physician's permission. We truncated adherence at 100% for each monitoring period to control for multiple actuations over a very short period of time and to provide a better measure of adherence</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were asthma-related quality of life, asthma control, FEV1, hospitalizations and emergency room visits.

This 15-item questionnaire, reflecting well-being over the past 2 weeks, has a 7-point response scale that provides a mean summary score. A 0.5-unit change is considered clinically meaningful. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire has been shown to be a useful indicator of AQOL in low-income adults. Asthma control was measured at each visit by using the 7-item version of the Asthma Control Questionnaire, which asks about symptoms over the past week. The score is the mean of all responses (0, total control; 6, extremely uncontrolled). The minimal important clinical difference is 0.5. A score of greater than 1.5 is considered inadequate control. Spirometry was obtained by using American Thoracic Society procedures for FEV1 and FVC. At each research visit, participants reported hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma or any cause that had occurred since the previous meeting. Measures were taken by research co-ordinators at each study visit, at monthly visits, for 8 months</P>

<P>UAB Asthma Self Management Program (n = 78): the core component of the UAB Asthma Self Management Program (ASMP) was a skill-oriented self help workbook, which patients were counseled about in a one-on-one session and during 2 asthma support group meetings. The workbook included information on physiology of asthma, asthma medications, identification and avoidance of triggers, detection of and response to asthma attacks, and asthma care services. The 1-hour counseling session included reviewing the workbook content and skills, identifying personal expectations, asthma triggers, and barriers to adherence, and practicing inhaler use until patients were able to do so correctly. Patients were also given peak flow meters and trained to use them for early detection of impending asthma attacks. Asthma support groups, facilitated by a health educator, consisted of 4 to 6 patients with asthma and, if possible, asthma control partners (spouses or close friends). Support group meetings were held once each month many patients came every month. Patients were encouraged to share asthma concerns, discuss adherence problems, and exchange patient-initiated solutions. Patients received 2 telephone calls and a follow-up letter at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, after the counseling session. The first telephone call allowed the discussion of problems and to collect baseline peak flow readings and to help determine their expected peak flow rates. The letter reinforced actions to take at different levels of peak flow readings. The second telephone call provided closure for the intervention. Overall, the intervention spanned about 6 to 8 weeks for patients. UAB Core-Elements Program (n = 76): this program consisted of a revised, shortened workbook that was given to patients. It was reviewed in a brief (15 to 20 minutes) one-to-one counseling session. Patients were trained to use inhalers and peak flow meters and rehearsed until these devices were used correctly. A follow-up telephone counseling session was conducted approximately one week later to review the patient's medication regimen and inhaler and peak flow meter skills. 2 weeks later, a follow-up letter was sent to patients, stressing the importance of adhering to the prescribed regimen and responding immediately to a drop in peak flow rate or other early signs of an attack</P>
<P>Usual-care control group (n = 78): patients received the education that was the standard practice of their physician.

<P>Compliance was measured using 2 4-item self reports, which were based on the prototype self report scale described by Morisky et al but were modified to be more applicable to asthma. The psychometric characteristics of the asthma therapy adherence scales were good to excellent. Adherence was analyzed in terms of the percentage of subjects with the highest possible scores on these scales. 4 clinical outcome measures addressed asthma status, specifically, the impact of asthma on respiratory symptoms and illnesses, functional status, and use of healthcare services. 2 scales addressed the severity of asthma symptoms in the past 7 days and the number of respiratory illnesses in the past 3 months. The functional impairment scale assessed the extent to which asthma had a negative impact on daily activities in the past 3 months. The scale for measurement of use of healthcare services classified patients as users if they had visited an emergency department for asthma and/or been hospitalized for asthma in the past 6 months. Other patients were classifies as nonusers. These measures also analyzed the percentage of subjects who obtained the highest possible score as users</P>

The second workshop used patients' diary records as illustrations of the relative effectiveness of controller medicines over rescue/quick-relief drugs in preventing asthma symptoms over time. Participants reviewed their own records of medicines and symptoms. The third workshop described asthma management as a 2-pronged effort of pharmacotherapy and trigger control. Between the first and second workshops, the Family Co-ordinator prepared families for their doctor visit. The Family Co-ordinator accompanied families to the doctor visit where he intervened if the family failed to communicate a thorough asthma history. The children in the intervention group were tested for allergies by an attending allergist at the hospital if they had not recently been tested by their own physician. Family Co-ordinator conducted a home environment assessment and suggested strategies for reducing asthma triggers</P>

<P>The experimental group attended 6 patient education meetings. The education program focused on compliance with sulphasalazine therapy, physical exercises, endurance activities (walking, swimming, bicycling), advice on energy conservation, and joint protection. 4 (2-hour) meetings were offered during the first months. Reinforcement meetings were given after 4 and 8 months. The program was implemented in groups and partners were invited to attend the meetings. 1 instructor (HB) provided information on RA, attendant problems, and basic treatment. The related beliefs of the patients were discussed and, when necessary, corrected. If patients anticipated problems with the applications of any of the treatments, these were discussed, including possible solutions. A training was given in proper execution of physical exercise. Patients were encouraged to plan their treatment regimens. Their intentions were discussed and help was given in recasting unrealistic ones. Patients made contracts with themselves regarding their intentions. Feedback on the eventual implementation of therapeutic advice was included in each meeting. The control group received a brochure on RA, as provided by the Dutch League against Rheumatism. This brochure gives comprehensive information on medication, physical, and occupational therapy. Sulphasalazine in the form of 500 mg enteric coated tablets was prescribed to all patients. The daily dose was increased in 4 weeks by steps of 1 tablet, until a daily dose of 4 tablets was reached. In individual cases, this could be increased to 6 tablets a day, reduced as deemed necessary, or stopped in case of inefficacy or toxicity, at the description of the attending rheumatologist.

<P>Compliance with sulphasalazine therapy was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months. Medical records and pharmacy records were the source of data on the number of tablets prescribed and the number of tablets obtained. At each evaluation, the number of remaining tablets were counted. Compliance was defined as the number of tablets that had been taken during the preceding period divided by the number of tablets prescribed. Disease activity was measured by the disease activity score (DAS). This is a function of ESR, Ritchie score (0 to 78), and number of swollen joints (0 to 52). The DAS ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the lowest level of disease activity possible, and 10 the highest. Physical function was measured by a Dutch version of the M-HAQ. The Dutch-AIMS questionnaire was used to assess physical function, psychological function, pain, and social activities. Compliance rates with prescriptions for physical exercise and with endurance activity regiments (walking, swimming, bicycling) were measured by questionnaire. Compliance with prescriptions for energy conservation was measured by questioning whether patients spread their activities over the day to prevent fatigue. A test for joint protection performance was used as an indication for the level of compliance with the prescription of joint protection. Patients were asked to perform actions, representing relevant ergonomic principles. The test score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents a poor performance and a 10 good performance</P>

<P>Intervention: ASTHMA SELF MANAGEMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS (ASMA)<BR/>Students in the ASMA group receive an 8-week intensive program. The intervention consists of 3 45- to 60-minute group sessions, and individual tailored coaching sessions held at least once per week for 5 weeks. Sessions were delivered by trained health educators during the school day. In addition to teaching asthma management skills and ways to cope with asthma, the health educators encouraged students to see their medical provider for a clinical evaluation and treatment. The individual sessions reinforced the educational messages taught in the group, helped students identify and overcome barriers to managing their asthma, and coached students regarding their medical visits. The health educator offered to accompany the student to the medical visit to provide moral support, coaching, or advocacy when coaching failed. Medical providers received a presentation by experts in person or by telephone about a recommended change in therapy. The medical providers were first mailed a packet containing: a letter informing them that one of their patients was in the study and would be referred to him/her for a clinical evaluation; a blank asthma checklist the students complete throughout the intervention and bring to the visit with the provider; and a blank asthma action plan the provider is asked to complete.

The common movements of TD were modeled and the patients were asked whether they thought they had the condition or had seen others with it. They were informed that they were receiving an antipsychotic drug and were given information about extrapyramidal symptoms and TD, its risk factors, prevalence, treatment, potential irreversibility and the 1% risk of TD in non-antipsychotic-treated patients. They were told that gradual discontinuation of antipsychotic medication was the best way to prevent the condition but if done abruptly carries a high risk of relapse and of precipitating TD. It was stated that the optimum maintenance treatment, taking into account its risks and benefits, was to use the lowest dose of antipsychotic drug that would keep them well. Most importantly, they were asked not to make any changes to their treatment without discussion with their psychiatrist. Finally, they were given the opportunity to ask questions in an informal interactive session lasting 30 minutes, and were given an information sheet for reference.

<P>Intervention: COUNSELING<BR/>In the adherence counseling intervention, trained counselors administered 2 counseling sessions to participants prior to HAART initiation and a third session one month after HAART initiation. Counseling sessions around HAART initiation were based on a model of successful antiretroviral adherence promotion at a large University of Washington-affiliated HIV treatment program in Seattle, Washington. All counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The second session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The third session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The adherence counseling intervention had been previously used and adapted at the same site in Kenya for over 2 years and was delivered in English and Kiswahili</P>
<P>Intervention: COUNSELING PLUS ALARM<BR/>Participants in counseling plus alarm group received both adherence counseling and alarm reminders. 3 adherence counseling sessions (2 prior to HAART initiation and 1 after HAART initiation) were conducted. All counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about the HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The second session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The third session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The counseling session was delivered in English and Kiswahili. In addition, participants were given a small pocket digital alarm, which the individual was to carry at all times for 6 months. The device was programmed by the study staff to beep and flash twice a day at a time convenient to the participant when medications were to be taken. The digital alarm could not be reprogrammed or inactivated by the individual and was utilized for 6 months after HAART initiation before being disabled by study staff</P>
<P>Intervention: ALARM DEVICE<BR/>Participants in the alarm device intervention received a small pocket digital alarm which the individual was to carry at all times for 6 months duration. The device was programmed by the study staff to beep and flash twice a day at a time convenient to the participant when medications were to be taken. The digital alarm could not be reprogrammed or inactivated by the individual and was utilized for 6 months after HAART initiation before being disabled by study staff</P>
<P>Control: USUAL CARE<BR/>"At HAART initiation, the study pharmacist explained the side effects of medications and problems associated with poor adherence in a 15-min session prior to dispensing drugs. All participants, including those in the control arm, received this educational message. Participants randomized to the control group did not receive adherence counseling or an alarm device."

<P>The measures of adherence were pill counts and pharmacy refill visits. After initiating HAART, participants returned to the study clinic monthly with their pill bottles to pick up antiretroviral medications. At each monthly visit, the study pharmacist counted and recorded the number of pills remaining in the bottle, the visit date, whether the participant took his or her morning dose, and the number of pills dispensed that day. Adherence was calculated as the percentage of dispensed doses that were taken since the previous visit to the study pharmacy. Total time between the last date the participant visited the pharmacy and the participant's subsequent pharmacy visit included any missed visits to the pharmacy or time when the participant was not attending the clinic. This calculated adherence was assumed to be constant and the same as daily adherence throughout this time period. Continuous adherence and time to monthly adherence &lt; 80% and &lt; 95% were calculated</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were viral failure, mortality, and change in CD4 count. Participants had blood drawn at 6, 12, and 18 months. RNA was measured using the Gen-Probe quantitative HIV-1 viral load assay. CD4 counts were determined using flow cytometry. Viral failure was defined as the first plasma HIV-1 RNA level greater than or equal to 5000 copies/ml measured at least 4 months after HAART initiation</P>

<P>The intervention group received serial, supportive telephone calls. Study site staff members (mostly nurses) followed a standardized script for telephone calls and received training by the study team. Spanish and Italian translations of the English script were provided. The telephone calls focused on each subject's medication-taking behavior, and study site staff members identified barriers to adherence and developed individualized strategies to increase adherence. During the telephone calls, the study site staff members also provided social support and assistance with the management of side effects. The telephone calls were to be made at specific times: 1 to 3 days after the initiation of the study regimen and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and every 8 weeks thereafter, as long as the subject continued to receive the assigned study regimen, for a maximum of 16 telephone calls over the course of 96 weeks. For each telephone call, a minimum of 2 attempts were made to contact the patient before leaving a counseling or general message. Also, a complete telephone call was one where all the topics described above were discussed, however, if that did not occur, calls were categorized as being only partially completed. The usual adherence support measures included an average of 35 minutes of in-person counseling provided by a study site nurse or pharmacist at the start of treatment. According to a study site survey, 67% of study sites reported providing written materials to study subjects as part of their usual adherence support measures. As well, 41% reported making at least 1 telephone call to selected subjects (deemed at being high risk for low adherence) as part of their usual support measures; however, the telephone calls were made to a minority of patients, the number of calls per patient was limited, and the content was not standardized</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were persistence with treatment and execution of the dosing regimen and measured using MEMS 6 to collect 3TC drug dosing histories. Persistence was defined as the length of time during which the medication is taken, that is, the time from the first-taken dose to the last taken dose, measured using MEMS. Execution of the Dosing Regimen measured how closely the patient's dosing history corresponds to the prescribed drug-dosing regimen by reporting the proportion of prescribed doses taken and was summarized as binary time series where for each consecutive day that the patient was still engaged with treatment, the variable indicated whether or not the patient had taken at least the prescribed number of doses. MEMS data were downloaded at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after each patient initiated treatment</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were measured in the clinic before patients initiated treatment (baseline) and each subsequent time point (4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks). Patient outcomes included: 1) Beliefs about HAART measured using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire&#8211;HAART specific version, which comprises 2 scales: HAART necessity scale which consists of 8 items assessing individuals' beliefs about their personal need for HAART for controlling their HIV, maintaining their health, and preventing illness, and HAART concerns scale which consists of 11 items which bring together a range of separate concerns about the potential adverse effects of HAART that have been identified across studies. Participants were presented with a series of statements about which they were told "these are statements that other people have made about combination therapy". They were then asked to rate their level of agreement with each item on a scale, where responses ranged from strongly agree (scored 5) to strongly disagree (scored 1). Scores for the individual items within each scale were summed to give a total scale score. A mean scale score was computed by dividing each scale by the number of items, giving a range of 1 to 5 for both necessity and concerns scales. This was done to facilitate comparison of scores between scales and to calculate a necessity&#8211;concerns differential (NCD) by subtracting concerns scores from necessity scores. The NCD score can be thought of as a crude indicator of the way the individual rates their perceived need for the treatment relative to their concerns about taking it. 2) HAART Intrusiveness Scale Consists of 10 items addressing the degree to which HAART is perceived to interfere with 10 aspects of daily life, each ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low interference and 5 indicates high interference. A total score was computed by adding up responses to each item. For comparison with other scales, an average score was computed by dividing the total score by the number of items. Possible responses ranged from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher perceived intrusiveness. 3) Viral load was assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after each patient initiated treatment using locally available method in each case. Viral load failure was defined as viral load &gt;50 copies per milliliter at 48 weeks</P>

<P>Intervention: TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH<BR/>The transdisciplinary intervention consisted of clinical follow-up, smoking cessation assistance, dietary advice and lifestyle modification advice. The intervention was delivered by a team consisting of an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, a nurse, and a dietician. There were 2 follow-up assessments - at 60 to 90 days after MI and 120 to 180 days after MI. In diabetic patients, capillary glycemia was measured (Advantage reagent strips, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), lower limbs were examined, and adherence to prescribed oral antidiabetic agents and insulin was reviewed. Those patients who were still smoking were advised to stop smoking by the nurse and also by the cardiologist. No oral medication was prescribed in this regard since these drugs are not routinely provided by the Public Health System in Brazil. After the above-described procedures, the dietitian evaluated body weight and performed a nutritional review. This review was followed by reinforcement of healthy nutritional habits, which included information on the characteristics and amount of healthy meals according to each case and also lifestyle modification reinforcement. The management plan was formulated as an individualized therapeutic alliance among the patient and family, the physician, and other members of the healthcare team. Finally, patients were evaluated by the cardiologist, who completed the visit with the specific medical history, physical examination and specific complementary tests. Drug prescription by the cardiologist followed the AHA guidelines for both groups (statins, antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Diabetic patients were evaluated by an endocrinologist. Drug prescription by the endocrinologist followed the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for both groups</P>
<P>Control: CONVENTIONAL CARE<BR/>Conventional care group received regular care. Before discharge, they were visited by a dietitian who prescribed a post-discharge diet plan after nutritional evaluation. Then they were referred to the conventional outpatient clinic for heart care, where the patients were seen only by the appointed cardiologist. Cardiologists kept a routine schedule with the patients and were seen for no more than 15 minutes. Then these participants were asked to be present at the clinic 180 days after AMI to perform a clinical examination and to obtain blood samples</P>

Reduction in smoking was not counted as cessation. Blood pressure was measured with the patient seated for 5 minutes and using an aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer, periodically calibrated according to the recommendations of the VII Joint National Committee (JNC). Body weight and height were measured on a manual balance (Filizzola, SP, Brazil), with a maximum capacity for a 150 kg load and 1.90 m height. Compliance with medication was evaluated by asking questions directly to the patient/family members. For each item with a positive change, 1 point value was assigned. A final sum of greater than or equal to 4 points was considered very good. In addition blood samples were collected at the outpatient clinic for the measurement of total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. All the measurements were performed during the 2 follow-up visits, first one between days 60 to 90 post MI and the second 120 to 180 days post MI</P>

<P>Intervention: MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING<BR/>Intervention group receives usual adherence education and motivational interview. Participants received 5 individual MI counseling sessions with a study nurse counselor over a 3-month period. The goal of these sessions was to help participants gain an understanding of their medication-taking behaviors and the actions necessary to successfully maintain a high level of adherence. The counselor used a MI script to guide the interaction with the participants. During the session participants were encouraged to identify and discuss barriers to adherence, to express and resolve ambivalence about taking medications, and to support motivation to attain or maintain adherence. After each medication was discussed and an action plan developed, the counselor ended each session by summarizing the discussion and the action plan agreed upon by the participant and counselor. Session 1 was completed in-person for all participants. Telephone sessions (for sessions 2 though 5) were conducted as needed for participants who were unable to meet the counselor in the clinic.

<P>The measure of adherence was a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) as the primary measure of adherence. MEMS consist of a microprocessor that is contained within the cap of the medication bottle. When the cap is opened, the date and time of opening are recorded and stored. These data are downloaded to a computer and used to calculate a variety of adherence measures. For the present study, 2 MEMS adherence rates were calculated. The first was based on the correspondence between the number of doses prescribed per day and the number of cap openings per day. The second was based on the number of cap openings occurring within one hour of the prescribed time for the dose. Each was converted to a percentage, i.e. per cent of doses taken and per cent of doses taken on schedule. Only one medication per person was monitored using MEMS. The staff selected the medication for monitoring using a predetermined list of possible medication combinations. MEMS caps have been used in a number of research studies assessing ART adherence and have been found to be a reliable and valid measure of adherence.</P>

<P>Intervention: HEALTH AND RECOVERY PROGRAM (HARP)<BR/>Participants in the intervention group attended up to 6 group sessions led by mental health peer specialists. Sessions covered the following topics related to chronic disease self management: 1. Overview of self management 2. Exercise and physical activity 3. Pain and fatigue management 4. Healthy eating on a limited budget 5. Medication management and 6. Finding and working with a regular doctor. During the sessions, peer educators modeled appropriate behaviors and responses, and participation from each group member helped model behavior and improve motivation for other members. Attendees are taught to develop short-term "action plans" for choosing domains of health behavior change. This process involves identifying a problem that is of particular concern, listing ideas for solving the problem, and then developing a plan outlining specific, short-term goals for improvement. 2 certified mental health peer specialists participated in a community-based, 5-day chronic disease self-management program (CDSMP) master training course to become master trainers in the CDSMP program.

<P>Intervention: MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION<BR/>MBSR aims to teach participants to respond to stressful situations "mindfully" - a state in which one focuses on the present moment, accepting and acknowledging it without getting caught up in thoughts that are about the situation or emotional reactions. This enables people to respond to the situation by making conscious choices to respond instead of reacting automatically. The MBSR program consists of the following elements: (1) individual pre-program intake interviews performed by the course instructor with each participant, lasting 30 minutes; (2) 8 weekly classes of 2.5 to 3 hours; (3) an all-day silent retreat during the 6th week of the program; and (4) daily home assignments including a minimum of 45 minutes per day of formal mindfulness practice and 5 to 15 minutes of informal practice, 6 days per week for the entire duration of the course. The total in-class contact is approximately 30 hours, and the total home assignments are a minimum of 42 to 48 hours. In addition, one to 2 additional individual interview sessions may be provided, at instructor discretion, to individual participants during the course. In addition to teaching mindfulness practices, the course includes didactic presentations that include information on stress physiology and stress reactivity.

<P>The patient outcomes were side effects, perceived stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Side effects was measured using a AIDS clinical trial group checklist in which respondents were asked whether they had experienced each of 25 possible symptoms in the preceding 30 days, and whether they attributed these to their ART medications, their HIV infection, or to other causes. Symptoms were coded as: 0 = did not experience the symptom versus 1 = experienced the symptom; the individual symptoms were then summed to create overall counts of symptoms and symptoms attributable to ART medications. To measure severity, participants were asked how much each symptom bothered them (on a Likert-type scale: 0 = not present; 1 = present but does not bother me; ranging to 4 = present and bothers me terribly). Average symptom bother scores were computed as the mean of these individual Likert items to quantify the overall average bother and bother attributable to ART medications. Residual plots of the sum of symptoms attributable to ART medications variable appeared skewed and heteroskedastic in our data, so log transformation was applied to this outcome. The residual plots of log-transformed symptoms attributable to ART and their average related bother/distress appeared close to normal and homoskedastic. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Perceived stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), was used to assess the intensity of positive and negative affect during the previous week. Mindfulness was assessed using a 5-factor mindfulness questionnaire.

<P>Adolescents assigned to the intervention condition received multisystemic therapy (MST) plus standard medical care. MST is an intensive, family-centered, community-based treatment. Therapists conducted a multisystemic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the family, then tailored treatment goals and interventions to each family to best treat the adherence problem. MST interventions targeted adherence-related problems within the family system, peer network, and the broader community systems within which the family was embedded. The therapists drew upon evidence-based intervention techniques that included cognitive behavioral therapy, parent training, and behavioral family systems therapy; the various interventions were incorporated at home, school, with peers, and within the healthcare system. Therapists were expected to meet with families a minimum of 2 to 3 times per week at the beginning of treatment. Treatment was terminated when treatment goals were met and the mean length of treatment in the study was 5.7 months. Adolescents in the control condition received standard medical care. Standard care at the hospital where adolescents were cared for consisted of quarterly medical visits with a multidisciplinary medical team composed of an endocrinologist, nurse, dietitian, social worker, and psychologist</P>

<P>Intervention: TELEMEDICINE ENHANCED ANTIDEPRESSANT MANAGEMENT (TEAM)<BR/>Patients at intervention sites received a stepped-care model of depression treatment for up to 12 months. Treatment intensity was increased for patients failing to respond to lower levels of care by involving a greater number of intervention personnel with increasing mental health expertise. The intervention involved 5 types of providers: (1) PCPs located at CBOCs; 2) consult telepsychiatrists located at parent Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs); (3) an off-site depression nurse care manager (RN); (4) an off-site clinical pharmacist (PharmD); and 5) an off-site supervising psychiatrist. The consult-telepsychiatrist accepted consultations or referrals from PCPs. The supervising psychiatrist provided clinical supervision to the care manager and clinical pharmacist via weekly face-to-face meetings. Patients and providers could choose either watchful waiting or antidepressant treatment (Step 1). Nurse care manager encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted to enhance standardization and reproducibility. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) administered the PHQ9 symptom monitoring tool; (2) educated and activated using a semi-structured script4; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers using semi-structured scripts for endorsed barriers. Follow-up encounters to monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects were scheduled every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. Non-adherent patients or those experiencing severe side effects were administered semi-structured scripts. A trial was considered to have failed in the acute phase if the patient: (1) was non-adherent to the medication, (2) experienced severe side effects, (3) experienced = 5-point increase in their PHQ9 score, or (4) did not respond (50% decrease in PHQ9 score) after 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy. All feedback was provided to PCPs using the electronic medical record. Progress notes reporting failed trials requested an electronic co-signature from the PCP. If the patient did not respond to the initial antidepressant, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note (Step 2). The pharmacist also provided non-scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side effects or problems with non-adherence. If the patient did not respond to 2 antidepressants trials, the protocol was to recommend a telepsychiatry consultation followed by additional treatment recommendations to the PCP (Step 3)</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were assessed using an instrument specifically designed for the study. Prior to administering the follow-up survey, a study psychiatrist examined the patients VA electronic medical records to determine what antidepressants had been prescribed (or refilled) during the previous 6 months. The most recently prescribed/refilled antidepressant medication was recorded prior to the follow-up interview and the adherence questions referred to the antidepressant explicitly by name. Research assistants asked all patients with an active prescription if they were currently taking the medication. If the patient was currently taking the medication, the interviewers asked how frequently they took the medication in the previous month and if they took the dosage prescribed. Patients were classified as adherent if item responses indicated they took the full dosage &gt; = 80% of the days in the previous month</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were treatment response, remission, health status, and quality of life. Treatment response and remission were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Response is measured dichotomously as a 50% improvement in depression severity between baseline and follow-up. Remission is defined dichotomously as SCL-20 &lt; 0.5. Health status was measured by the change in the physical health and mental health component scores (PCS and MCS) of the Short Form (SF12V) between baseline and follow-up. Improvement in health-related quality of life was measured by the change in the Quality of Well Being (QWB) score. Measures were taken at 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</P>

One healthcare assistant from each practice assigned to the intervention group in 2 workshops (an 11-hour and a 6-hour workshop). This interactive training included information on depression, communication skills, telephone monitoring, and behavioral activation for the patient. The healthcare assistants contacted their patients by telephone twice a week in the first month and then once a month for the following 11 months. They monitored depression symptoms and adherence to medication by using the Depression Monitoring Context List. Healthcare assistants also encouraged patients to follow self management activities, such as medication adherence and activation for pleasant or social activities.

<P>The measures of adherence were a modified Morisky patient self report scale, in which patients are scored from 0 to 3 on the basis of their answers to the following 3 questions (coded higher values indicate higher adherence): Did you ever forget to take your medicine during the last 2 weeks? During the last 2 weeks, did you sometimes stop taking your medicine when you felt better? During the last 2 weeks, did you stop taking your medicine when you felt worse? This questionnaire was given to patients at 6 and 12 months</P>
<P>The patient outcome was depression symptoms as the primary outcome, which was assessed by using the primary care&#8211;validated PHQ-9. Each item is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), for a total score that ranges from 0 to 27 (high scores indicate more severe depression). Response (50% improvement in PHQ-9 score) and remission status (PHQ-9 score=5) were secondary outcomes. Data for the following secondary outcomes were also recorded: quality of life, patient assessment of chronic illness care, and medication adherence. Health-related quality of life was measured by using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol-5D. The SF-36 allows the calculation of scores for physical health and mental health (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better status). The EuroQol-5D is a generic instrument that measures health-related quality of life with a visual analog scale (range, 0 to 100; higher ratings indicate higher quality of life). The number of physical comorbid conditions was determined by counting the documented diagnoses from different diagnostic groups listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, excluding all psychiatric diagnoses in the patient record. Severity of chronic physical diseases was assessed by using the Chronic Disease Score, on the basis of prescription data from the patient record. All outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months</P>

<P>Intervention: SHARED DECISION MAKING (SDM)<BR/>The intervention was designed to inform patients about their treatment options and to prepare them for a planning talk with their physicians. A printed 16-page booklet covering the pros and cons of oral versus depot formulation, first versus second generation antipsychotics, psychoeducation, and type of socio-therapeutic intervention was presented to the patients through the head nurse of the ward as soon as the psychiatrist in charge considered them able to co-operate. Trained nurses assisted the patient to work trough the booklet. Within the decision aid, patients were asked to write down their experiences with previous antipsychotic medication and to indicate their preferences regarding the different options on each topic. Nurses were advised to answer any questions of the patients and to encourage them to state any point of view contrary to that of the doctor. They were also instructed to postpone the participation of patients in the study if serious thought disturbances or delusional misinterpretations were detected while working through the booklet. The average time for working through the booklet was 30 to 60 minutes. Patients met their physicians within 24 hours after having worked through the decision aid with their nurse. The aim of these meetings (planning talks) was to reach an agreement between patient and psychiatrist on the further treatment according to the preferences indicated by the patient in the booklet. Like nurses, physicians were also trained about the SDM and required communication skills</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) adherence questionnaire and a measurement of plasma levels. Patients were followed-up at 6 and 18 months. To rate compliance with medication, patients were requested to fill in a questionnaire on their compliance (MARS). MARS is a previously validated 10-item questionnaire derived from the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and the MAQ (Medical Adherence Questionnaire). Physicians were requested to rate compliance of their patients on a 4-point scale ranging from "poor compliance" to "very good compliance". MARS rating below the median score of 8 were considered to indicate poor compliance; rating of 8 or above were considered to indicate good compliance. Physicians were requested to rate compliance of their patients on a 4-point scale ranging from "poor compliance" to "very good compliance". Physicians were requested to make unannounced measurements of plasma levels of the prescribed antipsychotics at 6 months and 18 months after discharge. The estimates of compliance by patients and physicians as well as results of the plasma levels were dichotomized into good and poor compliance. A "conservative" algorithm was applied in order to obtain an overall measure of compliance for every patient and point in time. Overall compliance was considered "good" if patients and physicians agreed in their (positive) estimates. In all other cases (incongruence of ratings, both rating poor compliance), compliance was rated as "poor". Results were corrected in the direction toward the results of the plasma evaluation if plasma levels indicated compliance or noncompliance difference from that derived from self rating/physicians' rating (in 2 cases)</P>
<P>The patient outcome was rehospitalization due to schizophrenia, which was recorded for the periods of 0 to 6 and 6 to 18 months after discharge from the hospital. Rehospitalization within 18 months after discharge was defined as the main outcome measure. The variable was dichotomized into scores of 1 (rehospitalization occurred with in 18 months after discharge) and 0 (no rehospitalization occurred within 18 months after discharge). At 6 and 18 months after discharge, patients' global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning Score) and severity of illness (Clinical Global Impression scale) were assessed</P>

<P>The intervention consisted of meetings in a group setting with the parents. The sessions took place in the afternoon and lasted about 1.5 hours. Shortly after the children were diagnosed as an asthmatic, 3 meetings (one every week for 3 weeks) took place and a follow-up meeting took place 6 months later. 3 pediatricians, 3 nurses and 2 psychologists were involved in these sessions: one nurse was present on all occasions, and the doctors and psychologists on 3 each. The goal of all the meetings was to reach the parents' "main worry" and, apart from teaching about asthma, the following key question was asked: "What is asthma to you?" The use of dialogue and peer education, whereby the group was encouraged to share personal experiences was emphasized. The control group, as well as the intervention group, received basic education about asthma and its treatment, including how to use the Nebunette, and information on environmental control at the first visit to the clinic. They received a written treatment plan where the principle was high dose (0.2 mg x 4 of budesonide for 3 days) initially and then, in association with URTI, stepping down the therapy to the lowest possible dose according to the status of the child. The treatment was stopped if the child had no asthma for 6 months</P>

<P>Intervention: RECIPROCAL PEER SUPPORT (RPS)<BR/>After the baseline assessment, patients in the RPS group attended a 3-hour group session facilitated by a care manager and a research associate. In the first half of the session, patients' laboratory and blood pressure results were reviewed and action planning was introduced. In the second half, patients received brief training in basic peer communication skills and were paired with another age-matched patient in their cohort. Peer partners were encouraged to call each other at least once a week using an interactive, voice-response&#8211;facilitated telephone platform that recorded call initiation, frequency, and duration; enabled partners to contact each other without exchanging telephone numbers and to set periods during which calls could be blocked; and generated automated reminders every 7 days if no peer calls were attempted. During a reminder call, patients could be transferred automatically to their peer partner's number. The system also allowed patients to leave voice messages for research staff or care managers. At the end of the initial session, patients were given a DVD that demonstrated peer communication skills and a diabetes self management workbook that they could use to help guide their peer telephone calls. Patients were also offered 3 optional 1.5-hour group sessions at months 1, 3, and 6. These were completely patient-driven sessions at which patients were encouraged to share concerns, questions, strategies, and progress on their action plans. Sessions were facilitated by a care manager and a research associate. Research associates were present to help maintain intervention fidelity by encouraging nondirective facilitation of group discussions and to complete a checklist of key areas covered and communication skills used in each session</P>
<P>Control: NURSE CARE MANAGEMENT (NCM)<BR/>At baseline and 6-month follow-up, all study patients had their HbA1c level and blood pressure checked and were informed of the results and the most recent cholesterol values were in their medical record. Patients in the NCM group then attended a 1.5-hour session, led by a care manager, to review their laboratory and blood pressure results, ask questions, and receive information on VA care management services. They were provided their assigned care manager's contact information and encouraged to schedule follow-up telephone calls or face-to-face visits with that care manager. Each patient was also provided with diabetes self-management educational materials. Patients in the NCM group thus received enhanced usual care, because even though they would all be eligible for nurse care manager support at the study sites, many patients are not aware of and do not avail themselves of this service unless referred by their physician</P>

If the medication had been stopped, the participant was asked who stopped it and the reason, and if it had been restarted. If the participant was taken off the medication and brought the cap to the study office, it was stored until the participant re-started medication and those days were marked as 'non-monitored.' EDM data were adjusted by setting certain days as 'non-monitored' on which the following events occurred: cap malfunction, lost cap, medication stopped by healthcare provider, someone else administered the medication (e.g. hospital, group home), incarceration, pocketing pills, reported exclusive use of pill box, and excessive openings (a form of cap malfunction defined as more than twice the dose plus one). The EDM data were captured over time in phases consistent with the 5 assessment periods. Data from the MEMS report on the Percentage (%) of Prescribed Doses Taken and Percentage (%) of Prescribed Doses Taken on Schedule were used for this analysis. The MEMS Track caps were used by participants during the entire study period (about 13 months) including 2 weeks prior to the baseline to obtain an estimate of baseline adherence</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were CD4 counts and viral loads. Data were extracted from participants' medical records during the time they were enrolled in the study. Dates that the laboratory tests were drawn were grouped according to proximity with the study assessment periods. For example, laboratory tests drawn as close as possible and prior to or on the day of the baseline assessment were classified as the baseline CD4 and viral load results. The median was about 27 days prior to the baseline. Participants did not always have both tests performed on the same date and therefore may have only had one test result available during an assessment period. The standard of care is to order these tests every 3 to 4 months once a patient has stabilized. Consequently, by the end of the follow-up period, participants had fewer laboratory tests available that corresponded to study time points</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were electronic monitoring and diary self report. The pill packs were modified so that each pack could be inserted into the electronic monitoring device, and each pack was placed in a separate envelope and labeled for the participant to place into the device at the beginning of its cycle. Each woman received an electronic monitoring device called SIMPill (Clinical Technology Advisors, Inc., Acton, MA) for adherence data collection. Each time the participant opened the electronic monitoring device to remove a pill, a short message service signal was sent wirelessly to a main server and a second server. As proof of pill-taking, each day was examined for at least one record of electronic monitoring device opening on either server. All participants were asked to recharge the electronic monitoring device once a month and received a text message on approximately the 15th of every month of the study reminding them to do so. devices and pill diaries. Each day was examined for at least one electronic monitoring device opening on either server. If 7 or more electronic monitoring device openings in a cycle were recorded, we assumed that the device was functioning for the cycle. If 4 to 6 openings in a cycle were recorded and the patient assessed herself as non-adherent (missing 3 or more pills a month) on the final questionnaire, then we assumed the device was functioning. However, if 4 to 6 openings were recorded in a cycle but the patient assessed herself as adherent (missing 2 or fewer pills per month), we assumed that the electronic monitoring device was malfunctioning for the cycle and the cycle was dropped from analysis. If 3 openings or less were recorded in a given cycle, it was assumed that the electronic monitoring device was malfunctioning and the cycle was dropped from analysis. The operational definition of a pill-taking day was from 3:00 AM to 2:59 AM. Only events during the first 21 active pill days of a cycle were used in the analysis.

<P>Intervention: RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL ASSESSMENT<BR/>The intervention was delivered by psychiatrists who were trained by the researchers. Psychiatrist attended a 90-minute training session during which they were informed about the rationale for taking into account the spiritual dimension in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and how to conduct a spiritual assessment. They were made aware of how their own religious and spiritual experiences could influence their identity and world view, as well as how their attitudes toward such experiences might introduce biases into clinical assessment and treatment. Finally, psychiatrists were reminded to show respect for patients with different religious and spiritual backgrounds. Psychiatrists used a semi-structured interview guided by the following topics: religious and spiritual history, effects of illness on spirituality or religiousness, current spiritual or religious beliefs and practices, subjective importance of religion in general, subjective importance of religion in coping with the illness, synergy of religion with psychiatric care. After each assessment the psychiatrist met with 2 of the authors, a psychiatrist and a psychologist of religion. In these sessions the individual patient was discussed for 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the clinical context. The participating psychiatrist reported the outcome of his or her spiritual assessment and was given guidance and advice, similar to clinical coaching; when needed, a more thorough discussion from a psychotherapeutic perspective was undertaken</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were self reported Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group and visual analog scale. Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group assesses missed pills over the prior 3 days. This measure has been used widely with diverse samples and the short-term recall period has been associated with long-term clinical outcomes. The measure was computerized for ACASI administration to minimize the social desirability associated with adherence reporting. Mean 3-day adherence was calculated by dividing the number of pills reported as being taken by the number of pills that were prescribed in the regimen. Secondly, visual analog scale assesses 30-day adherence, reporting separately for each drug along a continuum anchored by "0%" to "100%".This measure has shown to be correlated with other measures of adherence, such as medication event monitoring systems and a 30-day time frame has recently been supported as preferable to other approaches of self report. For the visual analog scale, the mean per cent adherence was calculated across all drugs in the participant's regimen. Assessments were completed at 1 week (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months for both intervention and control groups</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were the extent to which patients took side effect medication, as measured by the SECope. Follow-up assessment interviews were scheduled at 3 (second baseline interview), 6, 9, and 15 months for both the intervention and control groups. Interviews were conducted using laptop computers in private settings in research offices. Procedures involved a combination of audio computer-assisted self interviewing (ACASI) and computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) using the Questionnaire Development System. The SECope is a 20-item measure that assesses strategies for coping with HIV treatment side effects, and includes a scale for Taking Side Effect Medications</P>

<P>Intervention: CANCER TARGETED VIDEO GAME<BR/>The intervention participants were given a mini-computer containing commercial game plus the intervention game, which was a video PC game called Re-Mission47. In this game, players control a nanobot, "Roxxi", in 3-dimensional environments within the bodies of young patients with cancers that commonly are diagnosed in AYA. Game content was engineered to address behavioral issues that were identified in literature reviews and preproduction targeting studies as critical for optimal AYA patient participation in cancer treatment. Video-game play includes destroying cancer cells and managing common treatment-related adverse effects such as bacterial infections, nausea, and constipation by using chemotherapy, antibiotics, antiemetics, and a stool softener as ammunition. To win, players control the nanobot, Roxxi, to ensure strategically that virtual patients engage in positive self care behaviors, such as taking oral chemotherapy to fight cancer cells, taking antibiotics to fight infection, taking stool softeners to prevent bowel perforations, practicing good mouth care to combat mucositis, using relaxation techniques to reduce stress, and eating food to gain energy. Neither the nanobot nor any of the virtual patients "die" in the game. If players "fail" at any point in the game, then the nanobot powers down and players are given the opportunity to try the mission again. Players had to complete missions successfully before moving on to the next level. Participants were instructed to play for at least 1 hour per week during the 3-month period</P>
<P>Control: COMMERCIAL VIDEO GAME<BR/>The control patients were provided a commercial video game - a PC version of Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb served as the control game because the play structure and controller interface closely resembled that of Re-Mission</P>

<P>The intervention included patient education, 2 visits with a depression specialist, and telephone monitoring and follow-up. Before the first study visit, the intervention patients were provided a book and videotape developed by the study team that was aimed at increasing patient education and enhancing self treatment of their depression. They were also scheduled for 2 visits with a depression specialist (one 90-minute initial session and one 60-minute follow-up session) in the primary care clinic. 3 addition telephone visits at 1, 4, and 8.5 months from session 2 with the depression specialist and 4 personalized mailings (2, 6, 10, and 12 months) were scheduled over the following year. The mailed personalized feedback contained a graph of patients' Beck Depression scores over the course of the intervention program and checklists for patients to send back to the depression specialist, including early warning signs of depression and whether they were still adhering to their medication plan. The depression specialist reviewed monthly automated pharmacy data on antidepressant refills and alerted the primary care physician and telephoned the patients when mailed feedback or automated data indicated they were symptomatic and/or had discontinued medication. The ultimate aim of the intervention was to have each patient complete and follow a 2-page written personal relapse prevention plan, which was also shared with his/her primary care provider. Follow-up telephone calls and mailings were geared toward monitoring progress and adherence to each patient's plan. Usual care for most patients was provided by the GHC family physicians in the 4 primary care clinics and involved prescription of an antidepressant medication, 2 to 4 visits over the first 6 months of treatment, and an option to refer to GHC mental health services.

<P>Intervention: PHARMACIST INTERVENTION<BR/>The intervention was individualized and tailored for each patient by the clinical pharmacist based on disease knowledge, smoking status, medication adherence, self efficacy in managing breathing difficulty, and exercise and diet habits. Intervention patients were educated individually by the clinical pharmacist (in a structured fashion) on COPD, their prescribed medication, the importance of adherence, inhaler technique (written information was provided) and the management of COPD symptoms. The clinical pharmacist ensured that the patient knew the indications and doses of each medicine, and was able and willing to use the inhaler devices prescribed. The clinical pharmacist also discussed with the intervention patients the importance of simple exercises that patients can do at home (e.g. upper and lower limb exercises and relaxation techniques), symptom control (pursed lip technique) and the technique for expectoration (huff and puff technique). The pharmacist demonstrated these techniques and then asked the patients to carry out the techniques to ensure that they fully understood how to perform them. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. Advice, using the motivational interviewing technique, was provided to the patients who still smoked and referral to a special smoking cessation program run within the hospital was made. A customized action plan for acute exacerbations, including advice to GPs to provide a prescription for an antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and an oral corticosteroid to be initiated promptly by patients for exacerbations,was developed for each patient. The clinical pharmacist through motivational interviewing attempted to increase the intervention patients' self efficacy to manage or avoid breathing difficulty while participating in certain activities. The interventions were tailored according to the preliminary assessment, i.e. checklists of patients' needs were prepared by the research pharmacist and forwarded to the clinical pharmacist to discuss with the patients. The initial intervention lasted for approximately 1 hour for nonsmoker patients and slightly longer for patients who currently smoked. At each outpatient clinic visit (every 6 months arranged by the hospital consultant), intervention group patients received reinforcement of the education on COPD and its treatment from the clinical pharmacist. In addition, follow-up telephone calls by the clinical pharmacist to reinforce the education and motivate the patients to achieve their goals were made at 3 and 9 months, i.e. between outpatient clinic appointments</P>

<P>Intervention: PHARMACEUTICAL CARE<BR/>In addition to routine clinical care, patients in the intervention group received pharmaceutical care services provided by a dedicated hospital pharmacist. The pharmaceutical care program usually started about 1 week before discharge from the transplant surgery unit. The hospital pharmacist met with the patient 3 to 4 times and educated him on different issues regarding immunosuppressive medication, for example, action of the drugs, side effects, interactions, vital signs, laboratory data, and discharge medication. On discharge, the hospital pharmacist handed out and explained written information, including a discharge medication plan, information regarding the immunosuppressive therapy, and a diary for documenting vital signs and laboratory data. During the first year after transplantation, the patient met the pharmacist at least once per quarter year and at maximum once per month. During these meetings the pharmacist discussed with the patient changes in medication, laboratory values, and drug-related problems. Preferably, family members were involved. In addition, the hospital pharmacist reviewed the patients' drug therapy, to minimize drug-related problems, and simplify drug regimens</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were medication event monitoring systems (MEMS), pill count, immunosuppressant drug concentrations, Morisky score, and self reported adherence questionnaires. Compliance with the immunosuppressive therapy was measured by MEMS. Compliance was defined as dosing compliance (DC), which describes the percentage of days with the correct number of bottle openings. For patients of both groups the immunosuppressive drug was distributed in MEMS bottles. The bottles were filled in the pharmacy department of the University Hospital Mainz. During each visit, remaining capsules/tablets were counted. During hospital stays electronic monitoring was discontinued. All data collected during the study were analyzed after the study was closed. If the patient's overall DC was less than 80%, the patient was characterized as noncompliant. To get the pill counts, tablets/capsules remaining in MEMS bottles were counted during each visit of the patient. These data were used to calculate the compliance rate at each visit for each patient. Blood samples were routinely collected from all liver transplant patients for immunosuppressant drug monitoring. Serum concentrations were assayed in house by the department of clinical chemistry. Results were used for assessment of compliance. Serum drug concentrations were classified into 2 categories, "target" or "not target". The Morisky score was determined by evaluating the answers to 4 questions concerning medication taking behavior. The Morisky score questionnaire was given to the patient upon discharge, at 6 and 12 months after transplantation. In the self report questionnaire, patients were asked how often they forgot to take a dose of their immunosuppressant during the last 4 weeks. This questionnaire was monitored at 6 and 12 months after transplantation</P>
<P>The patient outcome was rejection episodes assessed by histologic diagnosis based on percutaneous liver biopsy. The number of biopsy-proven rejection episodes were documented during the entire study period and compared for both groups</P>

<P>Intervention: TREATMENT SUPPORTER (TS) INITIATIVE<BR/>Patients in the TS arm received both the TS intervention and the standard adherence intervention package. Elements of the standard intervention package consisted of self monitoring of medication taking using adherence diaries; regular individual and group education by peer-workers using patient education leaflets and tabletop flip-charts; and late attendee tracing. The treatment supporters were usually family members&#8212;usually a partner, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friend, or neighbor/friend&#8212;who were chosen by the patient with the assistance of the health workers, had accepted the patient's HIV status and were confidantes. These individuals were committed to support the patient with ART for a long time, had gained the patient's trust over time, and commanded respect. Patients were asked to bring their chosen treatment supporter to the ART clinic for the health worker to explain about ART, adherence and treatment support. This includes commitment, confidentiality, knowledge on HIV and ART related needs, and perhaps emergency resource needs such as money, help with household, and children. Treatment supporters were educated with the following WHO Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) educational materials: Patient Education Flipchart, Patient Education Cards, and Caregiver Booklets. They were also educated on how to remind the patient to take their medicine, be present at the follow-up appointments, remember all important test results and clinic history over time, and to accompany patient to support group meetings if possible. Treatment supporter meetings were also held at the clinic every 2 or more weeks to deal with issues of burn out, patient non-adherence and other barriers to treatment and adherence</P>
<P>Control: STANDARD ADHERENCE INTERVENTION<BR/>Patients randomized to the control arm did not have a treatment supporter but otherwise received the same standard adherence intervention package including the ongoing existing health education and adherence counseling support that all patients received during routine monthly clinic visits.

Patients who did not achieve this outcome were classed as virologic failures. Plasma was taken from patients at the 12-month visit for assessment of HIV-1 RNA viral load (Amplicor, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and was stored and analyzed at a later time point in batches. Laboratory assays (CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA load) were all done at a central laboratory (University of Nairobi Institutes for Tropical and Infectious Diseases).

This was supported by illustrations in the 'Regular Therapy with Asthma' booklet, which was given to each intervention group patient. Lifestyle influences, such as occupation and leisure activities were discussed where appropriate to the individual. The need for 'preventer' and 'reliever' medication was also emphasized during this session. Patients were encouraged to actively participate in the session and relatives were included at the patients' request. The second session took place on the following day. Previously given information was briefly summarized with input from the patient as a means of checking understanding. An agreed individualized self-management plan was determined, with written instructions using the 'Sheffield Asthma Card'. This also contained a telephone contact number. Each patient was given a peak low meter to take home and instructions on monitoring, with documentation of predicted peak low measurement and parameters for altering treatment, as well as clear written guidelines on when to seek emergency care. Home intervention was based upon a combination of symptoms and peak low recordings and all guidance offered throughout the educational program was based on the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the management of asthma in adults.

<P>Intervention: PERCEPTUAL (MOTIVATIONAL) INTERVENTIONS<BR/>Participants who were assigned to the intervention group attended a one-on-one education and motivation session conducted by the researcher. First, this session aimed to identify perceptual and practical barriers to 5-ASA medication adherence and, second, to motivate, convince, and educate. The session was designed as a structured dialog allowing the patient to comment and ask questions. Educational topics included ulcerative colitis, 5-ASA medication, and adherence. Participants were also encouraged to identify practical barriers to 5-ASA medication use, as well as perceived barriers to adherence. Strategies for overcoming these barriers were also discussed. Sessions lasted for 20 to 30 minutes and were intended to deliver individualized support to each patient. At the end of the session patients were offered an educational leaflet to take away. Patients had the option of being accompanied to these educational sessions by a relative or friend and any accompanying person was also offered a leaflet specifically written for relatives and friends. During the session patients were offered a free choice of up to 3 practical adherence enhancing interventions; simplifying of dosing regime, medication reminder charts, visual medication reminders for refrigerators and bedside cabinets, daily electronic pill box organizers with alarms, weekly electronic pill box organizers, weekly non-electronic pill box organizers, mobile telephone alarm set-up, taking into consideration that practical problems and adherence may change over time. Participants had the option of changing these interventions at any time during the study and at weeks 4 and 24 they were formally asked whether they wished to change the interventions. One brief follow-up telephone call was made to patients in the intervention group at week 4. During the mid-study visit a 10-minute reinforcement session was held during which the importance of adherence to prescribed 5-ASA medication was reiterated, beliefs regarding medicine-taking were reassessed, and any practical problems were discussed. All intervention group patients were given a telephone number which enabled them to obtain advice at specified times or leave a message for a return call</P>
<P>Control: USUAL CARE<BR/>Patients in the control group received standard prescribed care from their clinical team.

<P>Intervention: PHARMACIST INTERVENTION<BR/>A pharmacist delivered the intervention by using a protocol that included a baseline medication history of all prescription and over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements taken by patients, which patients brought with them to the baseline interview, and the results of an assessment of patient medication knowledge and skills. The pharmacist dispensed enough of the patient's medications to last approximately 2 months. The intervention lasted 9 months. When medications were dispensed, the pharmacist provided patient-centered verbal instructions and written materials about the medications. Each medication category had an icon associated with it. The same icon appeared on the container label and lid and on the written patient instructions. The pharmacist monitored patients' medication use, health care encounters, body weight, and other relevant data by using a study database. Information about patients was communicated as needed to clinic nurses and primary care physicians by face-to-face visits, telephone, paging (physician only), and e-mail (physician only). An interdisciplinary team of investigators trained the intervention pharmacist.

<P>The measures of adherence were Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), prescription records, and self reported adherence. MEMS is a prescription container lid and all prescribed cardiovascular medications were dispensed with MEMS lids that recorded the time and date of each opening and closing onto a digital chip. Data retrieved from the lids were used to compute taking adherence and scheduling adherence. Taking adherence is the percentage of prescribed medication taken and measures deviation from the physician's prescription. Scheduling adherence measures the day-to-day deviation in the timing of administration. A medication prescribed for once-daily administration would need to be administered within 24 hours of the previous dose, whereas medications prescribed for twice-daily administration would need to be administered within 12 hours of the previous dose. Scheduling adherence measures the reliability or consistency of dosing over time. Refill adherence as the medication possession ratio by using prescription records from the Regenstrief Medical Record System. Results for 1 year, incorporating the 9-month intervention period and the 3-month postintervention period was computed. Patients came for refills at approximately 2-month intervals. Considering the carry-over effect of the intervention that stopped at 9 months, the intervention effect on medication supplies would extend to 11 to 12 months. Hence, the 12-month period adequately reflects the effect of the intervention. Self reported adherence was determined for the previous month at baseline and 9 months by using validated questionnaires. Using these questionnaire scores, a composite score of self reported adherence was computed</P>

Interventions included counseling patients or carers on the purpose and appropriate doses of the medication, disposing of excess medicines and liaising with general practitioners. The pharmacists arranged further community visits at their discretion. All assessments and interventions were sent to the hospital-based liaison pharmacist. A revised care plan was issued if a patient was re-admitted to hospital during the 6-month study period.

<P>Intervention: EXTENDED CARE<BR/>Subjects in extended care (EC) received multifactorial risk-factor counseling, in addition to routine care (RC). During the counseling the nurse practitioner explained the presence of unmodifiable risk factors, such as age, gender, and family history, and modifiable risk factors, such as lipid levels, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, overweight, smoking habits, and physical activity. The study nurse was not blinded to the purpose of the study. The counseling focused on changing modifiable risk factors such as increasing medication adherence, reducing overweight, smoking cessation, and increasing physical activity. All obtained data were summarized in a personal risk-factor passport: a graphical presentation of the patient's calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. It also showed the target risk that could be reached if all the patient's modifiable risk factors were optimally treated, as well as the standard age- and gender-related risk. 10-year risk and target risk were calculated using the Framingham risk score. The risk-factor passport contained the most recent ultrasound image of the patient's carotid artery, as well as an example of a healthy and an unfavorable image of the carotid artery, which were both explained and discussed by the nurse practitioner. This risk-factor passport was updated during each follow-up visit</P>
<P>Control: ROUTINE CARE<BR/>Routine care consisted of measuring body weight and blood pressure and performing a capillary lipid profile at each visit.

Patients were followed-up at 3, 9, and 18 months</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were lipid levels and anxiety. A fasting lipid profile was analyzed from capillary finger-stick whole blood using the Cholestech LDX Lipid Analyzer, which measures total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated. Anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. Quality of life (QoL) was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey. 2 subscale scores can be obtained, a physical health score and a mental health score. Higher scores indicate better physical and mental health. Symptoms related to the use of lipid-lowering medication were assessed using a symptom checklist containing 20 items that were derived from the item bank of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL group. The checklist includes the most frequently occurring side effects observed by statin users. The presence of a symptom during the past 4 weeks was scored on a 4-point scale. A summary score was calculated. The self reported questionnaires were completed at baseline and then before subsequent consultations. Carotid IMT and FMD were measured at baseline and at month 18. B-mode ultrasound IMT measurements were performed in the far walls of the carotid arteries. The mean of 3 measurements was used to calculate IMT. FMD was determined in terms of the percentage change in diameter relative to the baseline measurement. Baseline vessel diameter was calculated as the average of the 3 baseline measurements. Each of the imaging operations was performed by a single highly skilled sonographer</P>

<P>Adherence was measured by means of self reported adherence and pharmacy refill data. Trained research assistants who were blinded to study assignments conducted surveys by telephone. Pharmacy refill data were requested at baseline and 12 months from all pharmacies identified by the caregiver. Self reported adherence was collected from caregivers. Caregivers reported how the child administered the medication (e.g. 2 puffs twice a day), then estimated how often the child missed doses in the previous 7 days. Percentage self reported adherence was calculated as use/prescribed use x 100%. For pharmacy-based adherence, by using a protocol described by Butz et al, the number of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) refills per quarter was abstracted from pharmacy records for the year before and after randomization. The number of canisters dispensed was converted to therapeutically equivalent values so that 1 canister represented a 1-month supply of ICS. The quarterly ICS refill rates were defined as the number of ICS canisters dispensed quarterly. These analyses included the quarter before enrollment (the baseline value) through the 4th quarter after randomization. An ICS refill rate of 3.0 is equivalent to 100% adherence for the quarter.

<P>The patient outcomes were 1) death or heart failure hospitalization during follow-up, 2) quality of life, and 3) psychosocial function. Death or heart failure was assessed in blinded fashion by a team of cardiologists. All patients, or in the case of death, their family members, were contacted every 3 months by telephone to ascertain occurrence of a death or hospitalization. Reports of death were confirmed by medical record, death certificate, emergency medical services record, or queries from the Social Security Death Index. Heart failure admissions were adjudicated by the presence of shortness of breath, peripheral edema, or chest radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema without evidence of another disease process accounting for symptoms or signs. Heart failure admissions were confirmed if the patient responded to heart failure therapy or had a documented decrease in left ventricular function. Quality of life was assessed as (1) physical function, using the 10-item subscale from the RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (&gt; = 0.93); (2) vitality, using the 4-item subscale from the RAND survey (&gt; = 0.86); (3) satisfaction with health and function, using the 11-item subscale from the Quality of Life Index&#8211;Cardiac (&gt; = 0.93); and (4) satisfaction with psychological/spiritual function, using the 11-item subscale from the Quality of Life Index&#8211;Cardiac (&gt; = 0.89). Psychosocial function was assessed as (1) major depressive symptoms, using the Geriatric Depression Scale (for which a score greater than 10 is a sensitive and specific screen for major depressive symptoms); (2) social support&#8211;emotional, using the 8-item subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale (&gt; = 0.90); and (3) purpose in life, using the 14-item subscale of the Psychological Well-Being Scale.

<P>Intervention: HIV TRANSLATING INITIATIVES FOR DEPRESSION INTO EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS (HITIDES)<BR/>The purpose of the HITIDES intervention was to support HIV and mental health clinicians in delivering evidence-based depression treatment. The HIV depression care team consisted of a registered nurse depression care manager, a clinical pharmacist, and a psychiatrist. This team was located offsite and convened once a week and as needed by telephone or in person. The depression care team communicated with treating clinicians via electronic medical record progress notes. The DCM communicated with patients via telephone. The HITIDES depression care team made treatment suggestions. Treatment decisions were made by the HIV or mental health clinicians at each site. The DCM delivered the following intervention components: participant education and activation, assessment of treatment barriers and possible resolutions, depression symptom and treatment monitoring, substance abuse monitoring, and instruction in self management. The DCM used prewritten scripts, which are standardized instruments that were supported by the web-based decision support system during these telephone encounters. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment. At any time, HIV health care providers were free to refer participants directly to specialty mental health care. The DCM conducted telephone-based monitoring every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. The NetDSS system identified potential treatment non-response as (1) antidepressant regimen adherence of less than 80% during the past 14 days, (2) counseling non-adherence of less than 75% during the past month, (3) participant report of severe adverse effects during 2 consecutive DCM encounters, (4) participant report of a 5-point increase in depression severity from the enrollment PHQ-9 score based on 2 consecutive DCM encounters, or (5) lack of participant response during an 8-week antidepressant or 12-week counseling trial</P>
<P>Control: USUAL CARE<BR/>Usual care depression treatment was provided by HIV or mental health clinicians without involvement of the HITIDES depression care team. Before starting the study, all HIV health care providers received 1 hour of HIV and depression training</P>

<P>The intervention, a 4-session couple-focused adherence program, aimed to improve patients' adherence to HIV/AIDS medical care regimens by fostering the support of their partners; in addition, to help couples address their issues of sex and intimacy. The intervention was individually administered to each couple by a nurse practitioner through 4 45- to 60-minute sessions held over 5 weeks. The session content included structured discussions and instruction, as well as specific problem-solving and couple-communication exercises. Key components included education about the importance of adherence to avoid viral resistance and maintain health, identifying patterns of non-adherence, developing communication and problem-solving strategies to overcome adherence barriers, optimizing partner support, and building confidence in the couple for achieving and maintaining improved adherence. Standard care patients received attention to adherence-related issues from a multidisciplinary treatment team. Dosing, common side effects, and the importance of adherence to the regimen as prescribed were discussed. Patients were instructed to contact the clinic to speak with either their medical provider or a nurse if they had difficulties with the regimen. Follow-up with the patient's medical provider usually occurred within 2 to 4 weeks after initiating a new regimen. Any adherence problems were assessed in order to find the underlying causes and the appropriate manner to address them</P>

<P>The primary measure of adherence was the MEMS cap. MEMS data were downloaded into computer software to calculate adherence summary scores for the percentage of prescribed doses taken (without regard to timing) and the percentage of prescribed doses taken within specified time windows (e.g. for twice-a-day regimens, intended dosage times were set 12 hours apart, with +- 2-hour windows around each intended dosage time). The adherence summary scores were adjusted through participant self reports of errors in MEMS use. Viral HIV RNA load and CD4 cell count assays at baseline and at week 8 were used as clinical measures. If a blood sample was not given, the patient's medical chart was examined for clinical outcomes within appropriate time intervals. If neither a blood sample nor medical chart data were provided, self reported biomarkers were used</P>

<P>Patients in the intervention group received 3 monthly calls from the pharmacists providing pharmacist-guided education and monitoring (PGEM). On average, the first telephone call took place within the first 3 weeks of the patient picking up their initial antidepressant prescription from the pharmacy and took ~19 minutes to complete. During the first call, the pharmacist assessed the patient's antidepressant knowledge and beliefs and clarified or explained issues that were not understood by the patients. Pharmacists rated the severity of their concerns and made suggestions on how to handle adverse effects, difficulties remembering or paying for medications, and other concerns. Also, the pharmacists accessed the patient's treatment goals or areas in which they hoped the medication would help, and how the medication was being used during the week before the telephone call. Pharmacists were expected to follow-up on any indication of medication non-adherence, inquire on why the doses were missed and make recommendations to increase medication compliance. The second and third telephone calls took place approximately 1 and 2 months after the initial call and on average, required 12 and 11 minutes to complete. During these calls, study pharmacists used the monitoring tool to guide their follow-up on any concerns identified in earlier calls and made new recommendations as needed. Pharmacists reviewed current adherence, whether any new adverse effects or concerns had developed, and evaluated the patient's progress in their medication goals. Patients in the control group received 3 monthly calls from the pharmacists providing usual pharmacist's care - defined as that education and monitoring which pharmacists may typically provide patients at the study pharmacies</P>

Results were multiplied by 100 to yield the percentage of missed doses for each period. The pharmacy records used for this method of compliance measurement were validated in 2 ways. First, the pharmacy records were compared with prescription insurance claims for 49 of 63 patients for whom claims data were available from the participating managed care organization. Inconsistencies were resolved by the research pharmacist after case-by-case analysis. Second, the patient's self reported antidepressant adherence was measured as part of the outcomes survey, "In the past 7 days ending yesterday, how many times did you miss taking a pill?"

<P>Intervention: COUNSELING BASED ON ELECTRONIC DRUG MONITORING DATA<BR/>When intervention participants came to the clinic monthly, a study member downloaded and reviewed the subject's previous month's electronic drug monitoring device (EDM) data. Each subject found to be less than 95% adherent according to the EDM data was 'flagged' for counseling with a clinic physician or nurse utilizing the EDM information immediately following regular clinic visit activities. The data were provided to both the subject and his/her clinician as a printout summarizing the per cent of doses taken, the per cent of doses taken on time, and a visual display of doses taken by time. This process of flagging and counseling was specific to each clinic visit. In each counseling session, the clinician reviewed the EDM printout with the subject, explored reasons for missed or off-time doses, and inquired about problems or challenges the subject might be having. Beyond this, counseling sessions did not follow a script. This was designed to accommodate each clinician's counseling style, allow for an individually focused discussion of adherence behavior, and encourage each subject-clinician pair to devise personalized strategies to improving adherence. In this regard, the EDM feedback provided data to inform and thereby enhance the counseling, but did not dictate precisely how the counseling should be performed. In the event that subjects did not immediately offer reasons for missed or off-time doses, clinicians were advised to say: ''Let's talk more about any problems that you had last month.'' Most counseling sessions were completed within 10 to 15 minutes. The intervention period was 7 to 12 months</P>

A subject in the control arm was flagged as a 'low adherer' if he/she reported &lt; 95% on the VAS, answered 'yes' to any one of the 6 behavioral questions, or reported more than 0 days for either of the quantitative questions. During the intervention period (months 7 to 12), patients visited the clinic monthly. The adherence measure was calculated at 6 and 12 months. Additionally, adherence was also calculated as the proportion of patients achieving high (&gt;/= 95%) adherence. The adherence self report measure was administered by study team members.</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were CD4 count and HIV viral load tested at baseline, randomization (month 6), and post-intervention (month 12).

<P>Adherence was calculated by comparing the number of tablets prescribed with medications still on hand, by the semi-quantitative identification of drugs and metabolites in the urine, by the identification of characteristic changes in serum potassium and uric acid in men on thiazide drugs. Adherence is reported in terms of the per cent of medication prescribed for the 6th month which was removed from the bottle and, presumably, consumed by the patient. Patients whose pill counts were consistent with adherence levels of 80% or more were considered 'compliant'. Blood pressure control was assessed by trained observers. Only patients whose diastolic blood pressure was below 90 mm Hg at 6 months would be designated as being 'at goal blood pressure'. Outcome assessors were blinded to study group</P>

In addition to the dichotomous measure of adherence, a continuous measure of adherence for the past 30 days was measured using the actual proportion of doses taken verses doses prescribed. Both adherence outcomes were assessed at 6 months (short-term) and at 13 months or 12 months (long-term). Self reported adherence assessment was verified with the MEMS caps of certain patients - ones who reported no change in HIV medications during the assessed interval and did not use a pill-organizing container. At 12 months, the following clinical outcomes were assessed: 1) CD4 cell count; 2) Log HIV RNA; and 3) Alcohol severity and consumption (using both the Addiction Severity Index and quantity and frequency questions assessing the previous 30 days), which was used to calculate the average number of drinks per day</P>

<P>Intervention: MODIFIED DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY (M-DOT)<BR/>Patients in the intervention arm received M-DOT services for the first 24 weeks of ART, in addition to standard care. Although consideration was given to provision of home-based M-DOT, formative research revealed that patients were concerned this would undermine their privacy and confidentiality. They also believed that clinic visits would provide beneficial access to healthcare workers, so M-DOT services were provided during twice-weekly clinic visits. To enhance convenience, participants could select 1 of 6 health centers for their M-DOT visits. At each visit, participants met with M-DOT observers (nurses) who observed ingestion of the patient's ART dose, inquired about difficulties encountered, and provided individualized adherence support. Used medication containers were also collected, pill counts recorded, and medication dispensed for the subsequent 3 or 4 days. During the monthly clinic visits, efforts were made to ensure that participants in the M-DOT and control group received equal contact time with study staff to minimize the likelihood that any differences observed would be due to nonspecific effects of increased attention given to the intervention group. CHW traced M-DOT participants who missed visits and brought medications to participants who were unable to visit the facility. After cessation of M-DOT at week 24, patients had no further contact with M-DOT observation centers. Like the control group, they collected monthly medication refills at recruitment clinics and received standard adherence support during weeks 25 to 72. No compensation was given for study participation, though travel costs were reimbursed for 21 M-DOT participants with financial constraints (USD 0.65 per visit)</P>
<P>Control: STANDARD CARE<BR/>As standard care, all participants attended 3 one-on-one adherence counseling sessions before initiating ART. In these, trained nurse counselors emphasized the importance of adherence; educated patients on the treatment regimen, dosing instructions, side effects, and dietary considerations; tailored the regimen to daily activities; and identified social issues like living conditions and family support. After ART initiation, patients visited treatment centers every 4 weeks for follow-up. At the first 2 follow-up visits, general adherence counseling was provided, as was discussion of specific emerging problems with side effects or medication intake; thereafter, counseling was tailored to individual needs. All patients were encouraged to bring a family member or friend to clinic visits and counseling sessions</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were a self reported adherence and clinic-based pill counts. Self reported adherence (4-day recall) was assessed 7.0 times (8 weekly from 1 to 48 weeks plus at week 72) and was dichotomized into those having missed or not having missed doses in the past 4 days. Pill counts were made at each M-DOT visit between weeks 4 and 24 when used medication containers were returned (twice weekly). These counts were aggregated to produce a 4-week measure. From weeks 25 to 48 and for participants in the control arm (weeks 4 to 48), pill counts were measured every 4 weeks and at week 72 (a total of 13 data points for both groups). Pill counts, measured as a percentage and dichotomized to &lt; 95% and &gt; 95% adherence, were calculated as: number of pills taken/number of pills expected to have taken *100</P>

Body weight was collected monthly and body mass index (BMI) is presented. CD4 cell counts were determined at baseline and weeks 24, 48, and 72 using PARTEC and FACS counters. CD4 measures were extracted from medical records by nurses and the study co-ordinator. For analysis, cell counts at baseline and week 24 were dichotomized above and below the median.

The telephone interview contained an algorithm of 11 questions addressing medication compliance, reporting of adverse events, providing information on common medications, and offering general medication safety tips. The intent of the IVR algorithm was to provide early identification of issues permitting timely intervention, provide a mechanism for tracking medication compliance, and provide medication information at the time deemed most valuable by the patient at his or her request and to provide longer term follow-up as the patient transitioned from hospital to home. Patients were asked questions about medication compliance such as, "Did you fill the prescriptions given to you at discharge?" and were offered additional information on 8 common medications prescribed to cardiac surgical patients on discharge.

<P>Intervention: CARE MANAGEMENT<BR/>Intervention group received care management intervention in addition to usual care by the treating physician. The intervention was delivered online but the structure was similar to the telephone programs tested in earlier studies. After randomization, participants received a welcome letter describing the program and it contained general advice about the antidepressants medication and self care for depression. Monitoring contacts were scheduled 2, 6, and 10 weeks later. At each monitoring contact, there was an outreach message from the nurse containing a link to an online assessment. The assessment included the PHQ depression questionnaire and questions regarding use of antidepressant medication, side effects, and reasons for medication discontinuation. Those not responding were sent up to 2 reminder messages. For each assessment completed, an algorithm generated a suggested response based on PHQ depression score, current antidepressant use, and side effects. The care manager could tailor this suggested response using information in the medical record or in messages since the last contact. The care manager communicated with the treating physician using an electronic messaging system within the electronic medical record. In consultation with the physician, the care manager might facilitate follow-up visits, support changes in medication, or facilitate referral for specialty care (including urgent referrals in case of suicidal ideation or severe symptoms). Each of the 3 care management contacts included this cycle: outreach message from the care manager, patient completion of online assessment, structured response from the care manager, and follow-up communication with the patient and physician as needed. The care manager's messages to patients included brief support but no formal psychotherapy. Patients were free to send additional messages or telephone the care manager if needed.

<P>Intervention: PEER SUPPORT<BR/>The 3-month peer support intervention consisted of 2 parts: (a) 6 twice-monthly, 1-hour gatherings held at the clinic, consisting of all peers and actively enrolled participants in the peer support arm and (b) weekly phone calls from peers to participants. At the time of enrollment, participants were assigned to individual peers by study staff based on peer availability and presumed compatibility. In the group setting, participants had the opportunity to interact face-to-face with their assigned peer and meet the other peers and participants, with the goal of benefiting from the discussion of the shared experiences of the group. The meetings were designed to identify barriers to HAART adherence and generate problem-solving strategies to overcome them. Other emerging themes included life issues that impact adherence, including HIV status disclosure, dating, substance use, and struggles with mental health issues. One of several research staff members co-ordinated the groups by making reminder phone calls, preparing the meeting room, and providing refreshments. With assistance from the peers, they facilitated the meetings by refocusing the discussion on adherence-related topics when appropriate. Otherwise, they refrained from interfering with the group process and the exchange of support among peers and participants, resulting in predominantly peer led groups. Participants received a USD 15 incentive for attending each of the 6 sessions. All were welcomed to continue attending thereafter but were provided neither reminder phone calls nor monetary incentives for additional meetings. Between group meetings, peers were instructed to call each of their study participants weekly to provide more in-depth one-on-one attention and feedback. Phone calls also were better suited for participants with confidentiality concerns and those who had difficulty traveling to the clinic or had scheduling conflicts with the set meeting times. Peers were instructed not to initiate contact with participants after the 3-month intervention period, but they were allowed to respond to requests for contact from the participants at their own discretion.</P>
<P>Intervention: PAGER MESSAGING<BR/>The 3-month pager intervention consisted of a customized pager system that combined the communicating abilities of the world-wide web and 2-way pagers. A computer program allowed for the timing of all text messages to be specified up front and then sent automatically without any further intervention from study staff. At randomization, the study co-ordinator distributed a 2-way pager and customized a message schedule to the participant's daily medication regimen, which was confirmed by the clinic pharmacist. In addition to dose reminders, 3 other types of text messages were sent: (1) educational; (2) entertainment (jokes or thoughts for the day); and (3) adherence assessments. There was some flexibility in the frequency and content of messages to accommodate participants' differing needs and schedules, but there was a minimum of 3 pager messages sent daily to participants for the first 2 months. Pages gradually tapered in the last month of the 3-month intervention to avoid a rebound in non-adherence. A confirmation return page was requested for every message sent. Project staff periodically reviewed the return page log and if no responses were received, the participant could be called to determine if they were having any problems with the pager. Between the first contact and the end of the 3-month intervention, the participants were asked to wear the pager at all waking moments. Participants had to use the study pagers and could not substitute with their own pager or cell phone. They were instructed not to use the devices for personal use. Participants could select from a variety of auditory alarms or a vibrate-only option if desired. If the pager was lost or failed, it was promptly replaced at no cost to the subject</P>
<P>Control: USUAL CARE<BR/>Before initiation of HAART, all clinic patients who are naive patients or off HAART for more than 6 months are required to complete the HAART protocol, a clinic-based program designed to provide education regarding HAART and adherence and to identify and correct adherence barriers before HAART initiation. The HAART protocol involves a series of 3 separate appointments with a pharmacist, nutritionist, and case manager after an initial meeting with a provider and before a final meeting when the provider decides whether to prescribe HAART. During these preliminary interviews, patients are given social and mental health referrals as appropriate, a daily medication schedule, and information on medication side effects and techniques to help manage them. All participants in each of the study's 4 arms participated in the HAART protocol if they had not received it in the last 6 months. There were no time or attention-control activities</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were self reported adherence and Electronic Drug Monitor-based adherence, measured at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. Self reported adherence was measured with 1 item from the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire assessing the number of doses missed during the previous week. The measure was taken via a computer-assisted self interview. Participants were provided with an EDM for the duration of the trial. Each participant was given one EDM to use with the most frequently dosed antiretroviral. The EDM adherence was calculated by the number of bottle openings recorded during the prior 7 days before each assessment divided by the number of prescribed doses</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) and CD4 lymphocyte count. Patients were assessed at 3, 6, and 9 months. At each assessment, blood was drawn to determine HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) and CD4 lymphocyte count. Study staff abstracted VL and CD4 lymphocyte counts from patient medical records if they were available within 30 days of the baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and 9-month interviews; otherwise, blood draws for VL and CD4 counts were conducted the day of the interview. Clinical outcomes were analyzed as continuous variables and as dichotomous variables with cut offs for VL of undetectable, 1000, and 10,000 and for CD4 of 350 at each assessment point and across all 3 follow-up assessments</P>

<P>Intervention: ENHANCED INTERVENTION ARM<BR/>Patients assigned to the intervention arm could choose an alarm device, counseling, or both. The alarm device was either a cell phone (if the patient so chose) or a small battery-powered electronic alarm device. In either case, the project staff helped the patient set up the device of their choice. Counseling was delivered by a bachelor level nurse. In accordance with a manualized protocol, the counseling sessions involved a cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving approach to: (1) enhancing motivation for treatment continuation, (2) learning about antiretroviral medication and the prescribed regimen, (3) keeping appointments, (4) communicating with healthcare providers, (5) formulating a daily medication schedule, (6) storing medications, (7) setting reminder strategies, (8) coping with side effects, (9) securing family and social support, (10) handing adherence lapses, and (11) addressing additional barriers. Participants could also invite a treatment partner to attend the counseling sessions with them. A ''treatment partner'' was defined as someone to whom the participant had already disclosed their HIV status and who was available to assist the participant on a daily basis. Participants who opted to have counseling, either individually or with a treatment adherence partner, had 3 counseling sessions of up to 1 hour each with the study nurse. The first session occurred either at the enrollment interview or within the first 2 weeks of initiating ART; additional counseling sessions occurred at 5 and 9 weeks. If necessary, the later sessions were replaced with counseling provided over the telephone</P>
<P>Control: MINIMAL INTERVENTION ARM<BR/>At the baseline appointment and before initiation of ART, all participants completed a 1-hour interviewer-administered paper-and-pencil baseline survey. They then participated in a 30-minute educational session facilitated with a flip-chart, which was designed to provide information regarding their treatment plans, likely side effects, and the importance of adherence. All patients also were given a daily medication schedule, a plastic pill box to organize daily doses, and a referral card to the hospital-based peer support group. Participants assigned to the minimal intervention were to receive no further adherence-promotion intervention beyond the usual care at the clinic, which involved monthly medication pick-ups and any conversations patients initiated with their healthcare providers. All participants continued to receive medical care as usual at the clinic</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were self reported and electronic drug monitoring device (EDM), using 7-day and 30-day assessment intervals. Adherence outcomes were computed for 7 weeks, 13 weeks, and 19 and 25 weeks. Self reported 7-day adherence was based on a single item ''How many of your HIV medication doses did you miss in the last 7 days?'' for which we computed a dichotomous outcome of 100% versus less than 100% adherence. A similar variable based on data covering a 30 day time frame was also calculated. An electronic drug monitoring device known as Medication Event Monitoring System or MEMS was provided to all participants for the duration of the trial. EDM technology consists of a plastic pill vial and modified cap containing a microprocessor capable of recording the precise date and time of each vial opening as a presumptive dose. Each participant was given one EDM to use with nevirapine or efavirenz. Based on EDM data, 2 continuous adherence variables for each assessment point, defined as the number of bottle openings recorded by the EDM cap during the 7 days and the 30 days before each assessment was computed date divided by the number of prescribed doses according to medical record review. Doses were spaced 12 hours apart and EDM openings 11 to 13 hours after the previous dose were counted for on-time adherence estimates.</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were CD4 lymphocyte count and viral load, which were assessed via blood draws at baseline, 13 weeks, and 25 weeks. As viral load data were not normally distributed, a log10 transformation of viral load data were conducted and used the transformed values in all analyses. CD4 and viral load were analyzed as continuous variables to enhance power</P>

At the end of the baseline phase, patients in the voucher phase continued to meet twice weekly with a research assistant, for a total of 24 visits. When patients opened their medication caps as scheduled, they received vouchers that were exchangeable for goods and services for each correctly taken medication dose.

<P>The measures of adherence were MEMS, a medication adherence and side effects questionnaire, and pill counts. For MEMS, one selected HAART medication was selected to monitor as the primary adherence outcome measure. On-time MEMS cap openings were expressed as the percentage of scheduled dosing times when the cap was opened "on-time", defined as taking place in a 4-hour window around the scheduled dosage time, that is, per cent observed openings/per cent expected openings. MEMS records were used to calculate on-time openings and the longest documented days of continuous on-time openings. The medication adherence questionnaire was a self report of patient's adherence for the previous day and the past 3 days for each medication. This measure was administered weekly throughout the study. Pills were counted for one selected HAART medication at baseline to reflect the initial stock, then weekly to track adherence, and after refills to account for new pills added to the bottle. All adherence measures were collected by research assistants during in-person meetings with participants</P>
<P>The patient outcome was the SF-36, a 36-item self administered instrument that evaluates health-related quality of life in 8 dimensions, including: physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and reported health transition. It provides 2 summary measures; a Mental Health Summary Scale and a Physical Health Summary Scale, which were utilized as the primary outcome measures of self reported health. The SF-36 was administered monthly (baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20). Plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load) was quantified from monthly blood draws using the Quantiplex bDNA Assay. Viral load results typically are widely variable, therefore they present raw results and log-10 transformed values. A decrease of at least 0.5 in log 10 viral load is considered consistent with improvement and not within the range of laboratory error. CD4+ lymphocyte counts, a type of white blood cells or T-cells vital to immune function, was obtained at baseline, weeks 12 and 20 from blood samples sent to the hematology section of San Francisco General Hospital clinical laboratories. HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of T-cells with CD4 receptors, and the CD4 count is used as a staging indicator for treatment decisions. When there are fewer than 200 CD4+ T-cells per microliter of blood, a person is diagnosed with AIDS. Weight was measured in pounds on a physician mechanical balance beam scale at baseline and at 20-week follow-up. Urine specimens were collected monthly and analyzed by Quest Diagnostics Inc., using enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), and positive screens were re-analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Reported results included alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates; however, due to low frequencies of positive tests for most substances only cocaine and opiates were analyzed in the current report</P>

Patients in this arm received explanations about the reasons for starting treatment and the relevance of appropriate adherence to prevent replication of viral mutations and the development of antiretroviral drug resistance. Patients' doubts about medication intake were solved and a dosage schedule was developed with the patients' input. Study subjects were also taught to manage medication and tackle problems such as forgetting, delays, side effects and changes in the daily routine. A phone number was also given should any questions arise before the next interview. During follow-up visits, adherence was verbally reinforced and strategies were developed to deal with problems that had appeared to that point, including rescheduling dose schedules to overcome adherence problems, providing skills to deal with minor adverse effects. Patients in the control group received a standard assessment consisting of an interview with a psychologist following the regular medical visit, in which only variables related to adherence were recorded.

<P>Intervention: PSYCHOSOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING (PSST)<BR/>PSST is psychosocial skills training. It is composed of 7 treatment areas: (1) symptom management, (2) medication management, (3) social relations, (4) occupational, (5) money management, (6) couple relations, and (7) family relations. A therapist's manual describes all the areas, the skills corresponding to each area, and the training strategies for each session. The trainers were 2 psychologists who used 6 learning activities to teach patients skills acquisition: (1) introduction and explanation of the skills to be taught, including preparing and motivating patients to participate actively in the learning activities; (2) demonstration of the skills by one of the therapists, followed by a question-and-answer segment that allowed for clarification; (3) role playing: patients practiced the skills by role playing during sessions; (4) role playing feedback to allow patients to identify the resources needed to perform the skills in the real world; (5) practice of skills in their natural environment; and (6) at the beginning of the following session a segment was dedicated to verifying the practice of the skills in the community; this information was registered in a skills learning check-up list. The learning activities were similar to the 7 instructional techniques proposed for teaching social and instrumental skills to the severely mentally ill. These were modified to 6 learning activities for the participants of the present study. Patients participated in group sessions, 8 patients per group, with a time limit of 1 hour 15 minutes, once a week for a total of 48 sessions during 1 year of PSST. To verify that each treatment area was being covered systematically and adequately, a therapist fidelity evaluation form was used. Family therapy (FT) consists of 2 parts: the first was psychoeducation, which included 8 group sessions where all the patients' relatives received information about the illness, symptoms and medication management. The second part consisted of 4 sessions for each family, including the patient, oriented to problem solving as needed by each family to improve communication skills, the recognition and management of warning signs of relapse, the importance of medication and its side-effects, compliance with AP medication, and keeping appointments with physicians. 2 family therapists conducted the FT. Recreational activities for the patients, conducted by an arts teacher, included singing, musical games, creative movement, and arts and crafts, once a week for 2 hours. Recreational activities were not considered as a therapeutic modality</P>
<P>Control: TREATMENT AS USUAL<BR/>Control group was treatment as usual, which was provided at the Schizophrenia Clinic of the INPRF by 2 clinical psychiatrists, who were blind to the 2 treatment conditions.They provided 20-minute monthly appointments during a 1-year period, controlled the prescription of their AP medication based upon the assessment of their psychotic symptoms, checked their medication compliance, recorded their attendance to the consultations, and registered all this information in their clinical files</P>

<P>The measures of adherence were self report, psychiatrist verification, and medical records. To obtain these data, patients were asked if they had taken their AP medication during treatment according to their psychiatrist's instructions. This information was verified using 2 sources: the patients' psychiatrist and the patients' medical records. Compliance occurred when patients took their AP medication in the full prescribed dose by their treating psychiatrist. A criterion of adequate compliance was determined when patients had taken at least 80% of the prescribed AP medication verified by all 3 sources.</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, global functioning, relapse, rehospitalization and adherence to intervention therapy. Symptomatology was assessed using the PANSS, which is a validated 30-item scale. The Spanish adaptation consists of 3 subscales: positive (7 items), negative (7 items) and general psychopathology (GPS) (16 items). Each item is scored from 1 (absence of psychopathology) to 7 (extremely severe). Psychosocial functioning (PSF) was measured using the Psychosocial Functioning Scale (PSFS). Functioning was assessed in 5 areas (occupational, social, money management, marital, and familial), and the patient's global psychosocial functioning (GPSF) was also assessed. PSF evaluates role performance through the level of satisfaction reported by the patient in the above-mentioned areas of functioning. The instrument is composed of a total of 35 items. Each item is scored from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very unsatisfied). A low score indicates better psychosocial functioning. Global functioning was evaluated using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale in DSM-IV, which measures the combination of 2 elements: (1) symptom severity, and (2) any serious impairment in psychological, social and occupational functioning on a mental health-illness continuum (level of functioning). To evaluate intervention adherence, 2 elements were considered: (1) patients' attendance at sessions was registered to measure their percentage of attendance during the intervention, and (2) the level of therapeutic adherence was obtained by considering the number of patients who completed the intervention, compared with those who dropped out. To determine the corresponding therapeutic adherence, the levels of therapeutic adherence must be verified. The percentage of desertion (non-adherence) was obtained by considering the number of patients who dropped out in comparison with the number of patients who initiated the intervention. Independent interviewers, properly trained in all research instruments and unaware of which study group the patients belonged to, evaluated the 2 groups under study: initial and final (12 months) assessments. To ensure blindness the interviewers were instructed to remind all patients to abstain from mentioning what type of treatment they were receiving.</P>

<P>Intervention: FULL-CAT<BR/>Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) uses manual-driven compensatory strategies and supports such as pill containers with alarms, organization of belongings, and activity checklists to prompt and sequence adaptive behaviors in an individual's home environment. CAT strategies are tailored to the specific cognitive impairments and behavioral approaches to goal-directed activity exhibited by each participant. Environmental supports in Full-CAT treatment were based upon an assessment of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions for each functional deficit were based on 2 dimensions, (1) level of impairment in executive functions and (2) whether the overt behavior of the individual during performance of goal-directed activity was characterized more by apathy, disinhibition, or a combination of these styles. According to the CAT model, individuals with poor executive functioning need high levels of structure and more obviously placed environmental cues, while those with somewhat better executive functioning need less structure and more subtle cues. Individuals with apathetic behavior benefit from environmental supports that cue and sequence behavior, those with disinhibition benefit most from the removal of distracting stimuli, and those with mixed behavior benefit from a combination of these strategies. Assessment results yield one of 6 CAT classifications for which interventions can be targeted. Once an individual's CAT classification was determined, strategies for specific functional problems were chosen from the manual. CAT interventions were established, trained, and maintained in the home during weekly visits from a CAT therapist/trainer. Patients in Full-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. The treatment lasted for 9 months and then the patients were followed up for 6 months after the withdrawal of home visits. CAT therapists were individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees in psychology or related fields trained using a combination of didactic and in vivo strategies</P>
<P>Intervention: PHARM-CAT<BR/>Pharm-CAT is a subset of the Full-CAT program, which is a manual-driven treatment using environmental supports. Patients received assessments of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions in Pharm-CAT are individualized in the same manner as those in Full-CAT treatment. However, only interventions that specifically target adherence are used. Additional issues such as transportation were addressed only if they related to taking medication or making it to clinic appointments. Patients in Full-CAT and Pharm-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. Visits in Pharm-CAT were necessarily shorter in duration because the focus of treatment was circumscribed around the issue of adherence.

<P>The measures of adherence were per cent adherence from unannounced pill counts conducted in the participants' homes twice during each 3 months in the study. The researcher making the visit requested that he or she be given all pills available to be counted. An adherence per cent was (the number of pills missing from the bottle and assumed taken/number of pills prescribed) x 100. The method required some initial preparation including asking patients to save all empty medication bottles (providing a sign and empty box) and bagging and stapling old bottles of medication so that the researcher would know when pills were taken from multiple bottles. Pill counts could not be blinded due to the obvious nature of environmental supports. Pharmacy records were examined as a secondary measure of adherence that would not be impacted by the obvious nature of environmental supports in the participants' homes. Pharmacy per cent adherence [(number of pills supplied/number days in period) x 100] was calculated. Pharmacy records that overlapped assessment periods were included in the assessment period in which the majority of prescription days fell</P>
<P>The patient outcomes were symptomatology, relapse, and functional outcomes. Symptomatology was assessed using an expanded version of BPRS. The psychosis factor score was used to measure positive symptoms; the higher the score, the higher the levels of symptomatology. Relapse was assessed using BPRS. Patients were considered to be relapsed if a score on any of the 4 items increased 2 points to a score of 5 or higher, or if the patient was suicidal, hospitalized, or unable to care for themselves without continual supervision. Functional outcomes were assessed using SOFAS scores conducted during a lengthy semi-structured interview. Higher scores indicated better adaptive functioning. To further increase validity, collateral information was collected from caregivers and relatives</P>

The first, and prevailing, strategy was self administered treatment, in which each patient collects drugs fortnightly from the most convenient health facility. The second was health worker direct observation of treatment, i.e. supervision by a health worker at a health facility when the patient met criteria for access to the facility, and by a community health worker at or near the patient's home otherwise. The access criteria, determined from the exploratory studies, were that the return journey from the patient's home to the health facility was a distance of less than 2 kilometers, a duration of less than 2 hours, and a cost of less than 10 rupees; and for unmarried women, an accompanying relative was to be available. The patient nominated the health facility most convenient for him or her. If the access criteria were met, a health worker at that facility was identified to supervise treatment; otherwise, a community health worker local to the patient's home and acceptable to the patient was chosen as supervisor. The supervisor was oriented on his or her role by a visiting field officer. The patient was then expected to attend the health facility or community health worker 6 times per week in the initial 2-month intensive phase to take the drugs. In the 6-month continuation phase, patients continued on self administered treatment, collecting drugs fortnightly from the most convenient health facility or community health worker.

<P>Components of intervention in pharmaceutical care program group (Group 1) included: 1) Computer Display of Patient-Specific Data. When a study patient filled any prescription (not only breathing medications), the drugstore computer alerted pharmacists to review patient-specific data contained in a separate study computer behind the counter. To safeguard patients' confidentiality, access to patient-specific data required pharmacists' individualized passwords. Study computers contained: (1) contact information for patients and 1 to 2 physicians caring for their breathing problem; (2) graphical display of all Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) data gathered during monthly interviews; (3) dates and locations of recent emergency department visits and hospitalizations; and (4) breathing medications (including compliance rates and refill histories). These data were obtained during monthly telephone interviews. Pharmacists were encouraged to document their pharmaceutical care activities at the bottom of the screen. 2). Written Patient Educational Materials. One-page handouts were developed corresponding to specific problems associated with clinical data stored in the study computer. Handouts, designed to be easily understood by patients, used mnemonic devices and color coding to facilitate distribution by pharmacists. 3). Resource Guide. Attached to the study computer, guides contained laminated pages with practical suggestions to help pharmacists implement the program in a busy practice. 4). Pragmatic Strategies to Facilitate Pharmaceutical Care. To reinforce pharmacist training and facilitate program implementation: (1) pharmacists were encouraged to page the on-call investigator with questions; (2) an investigator made personal visits to each intervention drugstore every 1 to 2 months; (3) periodic newsletters containing information about reactive airways disease and suggestions on implementing the program were distributed; (4) weekly lists were faxed of recent patient activity (e.g. medication refill, ED or hospital visit) and pharmacists' documented activities; and (5) pharmacists were provided with telephone appointment scheduling cards to facilitate interactions with patients at a mutually convenient time. During the final year of the study, pharmacists were paid USD 50 per month for high rates of compliance with the pharmaceutical care protocol (viewing data on the study computer for 90% of patients and documenting actions for 75% of patients). Patients in the pharmaceutical care group received a peak flow meter, instruction about its use, and monthly calls from research personnel to obtain current PEFR results. The peak flow meter monitoring control group (group 2) also received a peak flow meter, instructions about its use, and monthly calls to elicit PEFRs. However, PEFR data were not provided to the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group received neither peak flow meters nor instructions in their use; during monthly telephone interviews, PEFR rates were not elicited. Pharmacists in both control groups also had a 4-hour training session although the topics were different and they received no components of the pharmaceutical care program</P>

<P>Intervention: SHARED DECISION MAKING<BR/>Session 1 involved setting the stage, gathering patient information, providing information and negotiating a treatment plan. In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was negotiated, patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. The SDM model implemented the 4 key defining features. The care manager elicited the patient's goals for treatment and relative priorities regarding symptom control, regimen convenience, avoidance of side effects, and cost. The patient was then shown a list of the full range of regimen options for all levels of asthma severity, based on the then-current national asthma guidelines and KP pharmacopeia. These options differed with respect to the number and type(s) of medications, dosing, and schedule. Using a simple worksheet, the patient and clinician then compared the pros and cons of all of the options the patient wished to consider, which included the option of continuing the patient's current regimen to arrive at a treatment that best accommodated the patient's and care manager's goals. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was negotiated</P>
<P>Intervention: CLINICIAN DECISION MAKING<BR/>Session 1 of the intervention involved prescribing the patient a therapy rather than negotiating a therapy. In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was decided (CDM), patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. In the CDM model, the care manager prescribed an appropriate regimen based on the patient's level of asthma control, and explained that decision to the patient. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was prescribed</P>
<P>Control: USUAL CARE<BR/>Usual asthma care at KP medical centers was based on a stepped-care approach to pharmacotherapy with the aim of long-term asthma control, as recommended by the National Asthma Education Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 2. At some KP sites, physicians also had the option to refer patients to an asthma care management program, typically of less than 6 months' duration, in which a licensed health professional (non-physician) provided asthma education and addressed adherence and other medication use and self management issues in a manner similar to, but less structured than, the CDM intervention. However, asthma care management was neither a required aspect of usual care nor necessarily available at all BOAT sites, and current participation in that program was an exclusion criterion for the study. Once enrolled in BOAT, usual care and SDM or CDM patients (after the intervention phase) still had access to KP's existing care management services, if available, based on their physician's referral</P>

<P>Intervention: INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (IH) COACHING<BR/>2 coaches provided the coaching intervention. Both had substantial training in coaching methods as well as masters-level degrees in social work or psychology. Coaches each had over 100 hours of experience of individualized coaching with type 2 diabetes patients and had previously facilitated diabetes coaching groups. Participants randomized to the coaching condition had an initial telephone session with their coach within 2 weeks of the baseline visit. They were then offered 30-minute coaching sessions by telephone (8 weekly calls, 4 biweekly calls, and a final call 1 month later) for a total of 14 sessions. Participants were paired with the same coach throughout the intervention. During the initial telephone call, participants were asked what was important to them in terms of diabetes care, how well they were managing their health, and what they perceived to be their challenges or areas of required support. Patients were guided in creating a vision of health, and long-term goals were discussed that aligned with that vision. To facilitate learning, participants randomized to IH coaching received a binder of educational materials at the initial assessment visit. Contents included materials from GlaxoSmithKline's Adherence Starts with Knowledge (ASK-20) and Essential Connections as well as information from Duke Integrative Medicine. These were referenced throughout the interactions of the study. The ASK-20 is a brief survey that helps practitioners quickly identify and target reasons patients may not be adhering to prescribed medication regimens. It is accompanied by materials on topics relevant to self management such as symptom recognition, self care, and disease risk factors. Duke Integrative Medicine provided information regarding nutrition, stress management, and tips on how to best utilize time with the coach. Additional materials came from Essential Connections, a resource of tools for coaches to facilitate motivational interviewing techniques and behavior change, linking topics of interest with patients' readiness to change and relevant education content</P>

They were asked whether they had missed any doses; changed their regimens in terms of doses, frequency, and timing; or had drugs left over. This information was checked against the dispensing information on the Health Authority's clinical management system to calculate a Compliance Score = (number of drugs that the patient was fully compliant with)/(total number of prescribed drugs) x 100 (%).

Monthly follow-up phone calls to patients collected these data, with confirmation via hospital records. Date and cause of death were collected from interviews with family members and physicians and confirmed by review of medical records and death certificates. Quality of life was measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (LHFQ). It consists of 21 questions rated on a scale from 0 (no effect) to 5 (very much). Item ratings are summed for a total score that can range from 0 to 105. Higher scores reflect worse quality of life. Questions concern a variety of physical and psychologic aspects of living with HF and include activities of daily living, economic issues, ability to work, enjoyment of leisure time activities, relations with family and friends, sexual activity, side effects from medications, depression, and impact of HF symptoms</P>

<P>Families were randomized to 3 months of treatment with either Behavioral-Family Systems Therapy (BFST), an education and support (ES) group, or current therapy (CT). Current Therapy: patients in the CT group (as well as those in the other groups) received standard diabetes therapy from pediatric endocrinologists, including an examination by a physician and a GHb assay at least quarterly; 2 or more daily injection of mixed intermediate- and short-acting insulins; self monitoring of blood glucose and recording of test results; diabetes self management training; a prescribed diet; physical exercise and an annual evaluation for diabetic complications. Education and Support: in the first 3 months of the study, families attended 10 groups meetings that provided diabetes education and social support. A social worker at 1 center and a health educator at another center served as group facilitators. Panels of 2 to 5 families began and completed 10 sessions together; the parents and the adolescent with the diabetes attended the sessions. Family communication and conflict resolution skills were specifically excluded from session content, because these are the primary targets of BFST. Each session included a 45-minute educational presentation by a diabetes professional, followed by a 45-minute interaction among the families about a topic led by the facilitator. A monetary incentive, outlined below, was also provided to patients in this group. BFST: adolescents and caregivers in this group received 10 sessions of BFST. BFST consisted of 4 therapy components that were used in accordance with each family's treatment needs as identified by the project psychologists and was based on study data and family interaction during sessions. The 4 therapy components included problem-solving training, communication skills training, cognitive restructuring and functional and structural family therapy. A monetary incentive was also provided to patients in this group. Monetary incentive - to maximize completion of data collection, families were paid USD 100 (USD 50 for parent, USD 50 for adolescent) on completion of each evaluation. ES and BFST families could earn another USD 100 if they completed all 10 scheduled intervention sessions</P>

<P>Standard care consisted of receiving treatment from a multidisciplinary team. Adolescents and their families attended clinic appointments every 3 months to monitor the adolescent's health and were provided with traditional diabetes education services and eligible to be referred to community-based mental health agencies for psychological or adherence concerns. In addition to the standard diabetes care described above, adolescents and their families assigned to the MST intervention received approximately 7 months of this family-based treatment. The initial goals of treatment were to understand and form hypotheses as to what factors are maintaining the adolescent's poor health status. Interventions were then implemented to address these problematic areas, including problems with general and diabetes-specific family interaction patterns negatively impacting the adolescent's treatment adherence. Overarching goals of MST interventions often included increasing family cohesion and structure, as they relate to completing diabetes management tasks. A variety of behaviorally-based, action-oriented interventions may have been used during MST including parent management training, problem-solving skills training, and contingency management. Specifically, family-based interventions are designed to improve communication between family members regarding completion of adherence tasks, ensure adequate parental supervision of diabetes management behaviors, and provide family members with strategies to address general and diabetes-specific conflict situations. Overall, the goal of MST is to encourage parents to adopt an authoritative parenting style in which they are responsive to their adolescent's health needs, able to see clearly defined expectations for adherence behaviors, and able to enforce effective discipline strategies to address problematic behavior. Treatment was terminated when overarching goals were accomplished</P>

<P>Allocation was concealed. "We randomized clinicians to either use the decision aid with all of their eligible patients (intervention) or discuss antihyperglycemic medications in their usual manner (control) during a regularly scheduled clinical visit. A computer-generated allocation sequence, unavailable to personnel enrolling patients or clinicians, randomized clinicians to intervention (decision aid) or usual care and was accessed by the study coordinators via telephone. The sequence was stratified by practice type (eg, family medicine or primary care) and practice location, with a block size of 4. Consequently, patient eligibility was assessed prior to randomization for the first patient a clinician saw while enrolled in the trial, but any subsequent patients the clinician saw were assessed for eligibility without being blind to the study arm".

Thus the interventions might have been perceived similarly by participants.

Because antibiotics are not efficacious against such infections, it is unlikely that optimizing antibiotic treatment would affect the symptoms of these patients.

This precluded any measurement of the Family Coordinator's personal characteristics that may have contributed to patients' skill development. Only 28% of the patients who were originally contacted finally consented to participate in the study, which precludes generalization to the entire population of urban clinic patients. Another limitation is that an intervention period of three months was insufficient to measure how lasting were the gains in patient behavior or how robust was relationship between patient and physician. Another limitation of the study is that reliance on self reported data without confirmation by objective measures may overestimate the impact of the intervention because of participants' response bias towards success."

<P>Author's note: possibility of contamination of sample; control students from same schools. (pg 1004) "The study has several limitations. We relied primarily on self reported data and did not corroborate self report data with objective data. Therefore, the potential self report bias found in our school attendance data may also be present in our other outcome data. Similarly, our case detection was by self report and thus has the potential for misclassification bias. Because we targeted those with moderate and severe persistent asthma, the chance of enrolling a student who did not have asthma was low. However, we may have had false-negatives, missing students in need. Although recruitment of eligible students exceeded that in other asthma trials with urban adolescents (15), just less than 40% of eligible youth were not enrolled; this limits the extrapolation of study results to a larger population of urban, minority high school students with moderate to severe persistent asthma. We are also unable to extrapolate study results to other populations of high school students with asthma (e.g., white suburban adolescents with mild asthma) because we limited enrollment to minority youth with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The control group was a wait-list control group who received no attention. Although unlikely, it is possible that treatment benefits of ASMA were due to "nonspecific therapeutic factors", including the effects of attention and positive regard received by those in the intervention condition. At the same time, treatment differences may have been mitigated (1) if the consent process and/or surveys fostered attention to treating asthma in the control students; (2) if participants received interim treatments from other sources, which we did not assess; and/or (3) if there was contamination of control subjects by the treated adolescents. However, we had sufficient power to control for contamination, and our informal interviews with control subjects regarding their contact with other students in the program suggest that such contamination did not occur. Although cigarette use is prevalent among adolescents, and smoke is an asthma trigger, we did not assess the impact of smoking behavior nor exposure to second hand smoke."</P>

In the community teams and control patients, there was surprisingly little opposition to the study. All consultant psychiatrists gave agreement for a researcher to recruit patients but some team members declined permission. It was essential to brief the teams about the nature of the study and how previous work had shown good clinical outcome, because key workers or psychiatrists were likely to be asked by patients or their relatives to explain about tardive dyskinesia.

<P>(pg 2096) "Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. We relied on administrative claims to identify patients and evaluate outcomes. The use of such data for the outcomes that were studied has been validated, and we did not adjudicate study events with medical records. We recruited patients with hospital discharge claims that take time to become available in administrative databases. During the resultant delay, some patients may have become nonadherent to their prescribed therapies. Although this approach increases the generalizability of our findings to other insurers that seek to institute similar plans, it may have diminished the observed effect of the intervention. We evaluated relatively young patients who had been discharged from the hospital after myocardial infarction and who were covered by a large national insurer, and our results may not be generalizable to patients with other conditions or to those who receive health benefits through other means. We do not report the effect of eliminating copayments on the rate of out-of-hospital deaths from cardiovascular causes, since such rates will be ascertained by means of data from death certificates recorded in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Death Index (NDI), for which there is a lag between the date of death and its documentation in the NDI. The clinical outcomes we report include only verifiable deaths from cardiovascular causes (i.e., those that occurred during the course of a hospital admission)." </P>

<P>In the discussion section, the authors note that the fact that the patients were provided with free medication and sustained care may have contributed to the success of the study. All patients also received some sort of asthma education that may have influenced the results. Also, the inhaled corticosteroid therapy was adjusted prior to randomization and this may have had an effect on the success of the intervention. (pg 4) "The results of this study surprised us, as we had expected to find a greater decrease in asthma morbidity among patients who took part in the structured educational program. It can probably be explained by the fact that the control group may have been influenced by facilitating and reinforcing factors such as free medication and sustained care, including several follow-up visits with the educator, as described in the PRECEDE model contrary to what happened in one of our previous studies. In the present study, however, control patients were instructed on how to use their inhalers properly, and physicians could give information regarding allergenic and nonallergenic triggers if judged important. To differentiate the benefits of optimal asthma treatment from those of asthma education, inhaled corticosteroid therapy was adjusted prior to randomization using peak-flow monitoring. We agree that all patients received some degree of education during the run-in period, as optimization of therapy itself requires interaction with the patient to document symptoms and adjust or change medication if necessary, an inherently educational process. Although the control group received more than the usual care treatment, there were marked differences between control and educated patients, as none of the patients from Group C received the book Understand and Control Asthma, none were given a written action plan, and none took part in a structured educational program. Finally, none of these patients had a peak-flow meter at home after completion of the run-in period. Apart from physician's recommendations, no reinforcement was given by the specialized educator with regard to compliance in patients in Group C. Enrolled in this study were patients with moderate to severe asthma (daily respiratory symptoms) who required chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids to maintain good control of their illness. We did not select a very high-risk group of patients: these subjects did not have socioeconomic problems, nor had they had several visits to the emergency room or hospitalizations related to asthma in the year prior to enrollment. Previous studies have already shown that asthma morbidity can be decreased by education in these specific subgroups of patients. The results of our study do not rule out the possibility that education could decrease asthma morbidity under other circumstances. Indeed, this study was conducted in a tertiary care setting by asthma specialists, and had we conducted this study in patients with less optimal care or in high-risk populations, we might have obtained different results. Furthermore, referring the patient to a specialized asthma educator may help physicians to complete the educational interventions, sometimes difficult to provide in a busy clinic. In order to assess compliance with treatment, we supplied the medication at no charge throughout the study. As inhaled corticosteroids are expensive, some patients, particularly those receiving high dosages, cannot afford this treatment. Had the asthmatic subjects paid for their own medication, it is possible that compliance with treatment would have been lower among control patients than among patients from the two educated groups, and this might have biased the outcome of the control group."</P>

The widespread community interest in this study and subsequent increased awareness of risk factors for coronary heart disease may have diluted the effect of mentoring.

<P>(pg 173) Authors indicate that there are certain limitations to this study. In general, studies that involve switching therapy tend to attract patients motivated to make a change in treatment, and such studies can have an intrinsic bias toward favoring the switch strategy under evaluation. More than 90% of subjects cited regimen simplification as a reason for participation. This is not surprising given that the median duration of prior ART was 3 years, and individuals showing poor regimen tolerability would be much less likely to be receiving such long-term therapy. Thus, the motivation to simplify therapy in this stable population could have affected patients reporting of AEs, adherence, and/or medication preference</P>

First, the sample was composed primarily of low-income African American men. Thus, the results cannot be generalized to those in other groups who are also prescribed ART. Future research should focus on other groups affected by HIV, including women and gay men and other cultural groups, including Hispanic and Asian men and women. Second, all men and women who were initiating or changing ART were eligible to participate provided they met other study criteria. We did not limit participants to those who were reported difficulties taking their medications. We found that many participants maintained a high level of adherence throughout the study, limiting our ability to fully test the usefulness of MI in promoting behavioral change. Finally, we asked participants to use MEMS &#8224; caps throughout the one-year study. This proved difficult for some individuals. In future studies, researchers might consider limiting the use of these caps to short periods of time around the follow-up assessment periods. Finally, cost of lab tests limited our ability to fully test the effect of the intervention on viral load and CD4 counts. Although there was some indication that those in the intervention group had more favorable lab values, future research should include systematic assessment of these indices. Finally, the types and doses of medications changed over the course of the study..."</P>

<P>Mention risk that not paying for control medications might skew results. (pg 471) "It can be argued that the provision of free drugs could have contributed to the better outcome in the STOPS group. The average cost of medication for a month using atypical drugs is about 900 rupees (1 is equivalent to approximately 136 rupees), which can be quite costly for patients and families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds presenting in a public hospital such as Lady Reading Hospital. The DOTS is a complex intervention and free access to medication is an essential component of the DOTS programme as applied in tuberculosis control. The participants in the TAU group had the option of accessing free drugs from the social welfare department. Providing free medication as part of the trial would have grossly distorted the TAU condition in these settings. The evidence, however, suggests that even if drugs were free, non-adherence persists. One recent study showed that even among people who have health plans with no cost-sharing for medication, rates of non-adherence were nearly 40%."</P>

<P>Limitations in discussion note other risks of bias. (pg 315) "The most important limitation of this study is the poor reliability of patient self reported compliance. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions on patient compliance beyond filling the prescription. Another limitation was the choice of a study medication, which is often prescribed for relatively benign, self limiting conditions, because spontaneous improvement in the patient's condition could further decrease compliance. The benign nature of disease in this population could have also limited the ability to find differences in patient morbidity and use of hospital resources as a result of noncompliance. Finally, small sample size and our urban setting limit the ability to generalize the results to larger populations or other ED settings."

<P>The authors note several limitations to their study: "There are certainly limitation to our study, including the relatively low sample size, a considerable proportion of patients dropping out of the study because they were lost to follow-up, a one time intervention without iteration or "booster sessions" and the well-known difficulty of measuring compliance of outpatients." (pg 996) "Limitations and strengths of the study... Since we placed emphasis on studying the topic under real-world conditions (state hospitals) and tried to avoid a study with highly selected patients, many of the limitations from the one point of view (internal validity) are thus strengths from another point of view (external validity): &#8226; We abstained from individual randomization to avoid contamination of the verum and control conditions and to avoid the situation that the same physician had to practice SDM and routine care at the same time. We believe, however, that our study does not suffer from the limitations of classical cluster trials (e.g. selection bias), since individual patients were 'randomly' sent to that ward of a pair that had free beds available and were not selected according to any patient characteristics. &#8226; We used broad inclusion criteria, which resulted in many patients being included who were afterward considered incapable of making reasonable decisions, but which shed light on the percentage of patients that can successfully be reached with this intervention. &#8226; This trial was not performed in a university setting but in state hospitals, which led on the one hand to a higher amount of lacking (selfreport) values and which limited the amount of questionnaires that could be administered (e.g. an objective measure of the decision making capacity), but which on the other hand now enables us to argue that the intervention is feasible in normal patient care and with 'normal', non-selected patients. &#8226; The intervention took place as 'soon as possible'. An intervention shortly before discharge might have more adequately addressed the needs of the patients in regard to long-term care. On the other hand, many decisions concerning maintenance therapy (e.g. drug choice) are made early during hospitalization." (pg 271 (supplement))</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Authors noted several limitations: "Our study has limitations. First, we included only male patients. Although peer-support interventions have been found to be more acceptable to women than men, research also suggests that similar peers are more likely to have mutually supportive peer relationships. Peer-support initiatives may thus be especially effective among patients with common identity bonds, such as shared experiences, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, or religious faith. We targeted veterans in the same age cohort, who often have a common sense of identity because of their shared military experience within a specific sociohistorical context. Future studies should attempt to replicate this study in other, sex-mixed samples of patients and examine the effectiveness of different peer-support models among patients with a range of self-management challenges. The success of our intervention can help guide other efforts to combine periodic group sessions, care management support, and peer communication to initiate and support other behavior changes in diabetes or other conditions that require high levels of self-management (such as obesity, heart failure, chronic pain, or physical inactivity). Second, our intervention lasted only 6 months; future studies should test peer-support interventions over longer periods. One advantage of peer-support interventions is their potential to provide flexible, longer-term selfmanagement support. Third, although the nurse care managers and all other providers were blinded to the study's hypotheses, the nature of the intervention prevented blinding to treatment group. We also cannot exclude treatment bias, because the same care managers provided care to patients in both groups. However, we would expect that the nurse care managers would want to show their current provision of care to be superior to between-patient support, so the most likely effect of any treatment bias would be toward the null. Of note, this intervention focused exclusively on activating patients to improve their self-management. A more powerful intervention would also target provider behavior, such as by encouraging providers to initiate or intensify medication. Finally, our intervention had a relatively low rate of uptake. Peer-based programs, such as ours, would need to be part of a menu of options available to patients." (pg 512)</P>

<P>From discussion (pg 10): "In 2006, our main recruitment site implemented an ongoing "Prevention for Positives" initiative where all providers were required to elicit and document discussion about risky behaviors with each patient every 12 months. When indicated, patients were referred for risk reduction education and counseling. Our results may be impacted by the addition of this program. Given this occurred for women in both groups, it might have diluted between group differences. In addition, risk behaviors in this study were measured by self-report, and could be subject to bias from poor recall or social desirability. Due to cost constraints, laboratory results were extracted from medical records and dates of lab tests did not always correspond in time to follow-up assessments. As the study progressed, there were fewer lab data for the 9 month assessment period. In the future blood draws consistent with the follow-up periods are recommended."</P>

<P>Authors noted the following limitations: "The lack of a significant difference between the arms could be attributed to the frequent use of alternative reminder systems in the control arm. At the beginning of the study, all women were given routine contraceptive counseling, including the possibility of using reminder methods to help them to remember to take their pill. The high rate of reminder system use in the control arm, particularly electronic systems such as cell phone alarms that mimicked the study intervention, could contribute to the lack of difference between the arms." - (pg 639) "Possible reasons for the lack of pregnancies may be that our participants had a low frequency of sexual activity or correctly used backup methods like condoms when they had poor adherence with oral contraceptive pills. Coital activity and condom use with each sexual act was not assessed. The text-message arm also reported more frequent condom and emergency contraception use during the study, so the text-message reminders may have had an unintended effect of reinforcing use of backup methods for women at risk." - (pg 639) "Our study cohort was mostly white, well-educated, and nulliparous, which may limit the generalizability of these findings to a more diverse population." - (pg 639) "Because we cannot exclude the possibility that participants may open and close the electronic monitoring device without taking their oral contraceptive pill, the electronic monitoring device may be underestimating the actual missed pill rate in the cohort." - (pg 639) "Our wireless technology was limited by mechanical and technological issues as described, but only 42 of the possible 246 cycles (17%) could not be included in analysis compared with 220 of a possible 507 cycles (43%) that could not be analyzed in the study by Potter et al." - (pg 640) "An electronic monitoring device with an embedded memory chip has been tested among oral contraceptive pill users, but data collection was limited by unreturned devices or erased memory chips." - (pg 634)</P>

<P>Authors note the following(pg 91): "Recruiting 135 subjects from a single center became more difficult than was expected. Initially, the research team anticipated that approximately 10 subjects per week could be recruited for the study. In reality, less than half of these eligible subjects actually kept their scheduled visit. Further, because of the time constraints of a busy clinic, some subjects were not approached. Of those approached, less than half of these subjects followed up with the enrollment process (paper- work returned) or with the initial study intervention (education session). In the end, the research team recruited one to three subjects per month, with 89 subjects recruited over a 3-year period. The attrition rate was 16%, with 14 subjects failing to complete the study protocol. One subject requested to leave the study. The remainder were dropped from the study after repeated attempts by the study coordinator to have the family complete the protocol with its required clinic visits, HbA1c blood work, and paperwork. Although the research design with its original sample size accounted for differences in subjects' ages, the smaller sample size could not. Because there was a big difference in diabetes management and parent and child interactions around diabetes depending on age, without the power of the original sample size, our results may not reflect accurate comparisons. As well, the subjects completing the study may have represented a biased sample because they were not necessarily representative of patients and families in poor control. Another limitation of the study was using unstandardized assessment tools versus standardized assessment tools. The research team elected to use the ADH, TEAM, and KNOW as they were assessment tools already integrated into the clinical practice of the Diabetes Center for Children. Data collection was simplified, however; these tools do not have the psychometric properties established for standardized tools. Obtaining data points at the times specified in the protocol proved to be difficult when done in real-life terms with subjects and their families. The study was designed to obtain data at baseline and then in two 3-month intervals. Although the study coordinator was very flexible in meeting families' scheduling needs, there were frequent b no-shows Q in the clinic, thus, requiring rescheduling of appointments. The 3-month interval at times stretched to 4- to 6-month intervals between data points. Finally, the study design did not control for telephone contacts between clinicians and families in the ED or SC groups. Because all subjects were in relatively poor control, clinicians often elected to have families call in to review blood sugars. Whether and how much this occurred was not followed for this study. It is possible that the failure to see larger between-group differences was because the interventions may not have been different enough."</P>

<P>Several limitations have been listed by the authors but how they might have influenced the result is unknown. (pg 84) "The study had some limitations. First, cultural context is likely to have influenced the results, and the study should be replicated in other areas. Only patients in the intervention group received additional attention from the psychiatrists, who explored and discussed patients' personal beliefs, which may have introduced significant bias. The additional time invested by the psychiatrists could have made a difference, an effect having little to do with the focus on spiritual issues. Furthermore, psychiatrists received supervision only for patients in the intervention group, and supervision itself could have altered patients' outcomes. Patients signed an informed consent form to participate in the study and then were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The latter patients might have been disappointed at not having received a spiritual assessment, which may have altered their evaluations. Other limitations were noted above: the short training session and the lack of commitment among some clinicians."</P>

Furthermore, social desirability and recall bias associated with the use of a selfreport method to assess medications adherence could have affected the results.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The authors note the following: "There are several noteworthy limitations in the current study. First, the experimental design used a treatment as usual comparison rather than a matched attention control condition, so it is impossible to determine the potential confounding effects of increased attention by trial staff in the experimental condition rather than the control condition. Further, the assessment did not capture comprehensive data on access and use of adherence resources outside of the trial, a construct that is gaining attention in adherence research. Second, the use of self reported adherence data, while supported by validity studies has been questioned in HIV research as being inflated because of recall, social desirability, and other biases. To minimize the biases inherent in self reported data, we employed several techniques. We used conservative cut-offs of validated measures of adherence that have demonstrated meaningful relationships with important outcomes, such as viral load, in other studies. ACASI interviewing for the adherence portion of the interview was used, thereby removing the interviewer's presence and minimizing social desirability bias. Such approaches to computerized adherence assessment have shown favorable effects in other studies. Despite these strategies, it should be noted that the use of self reported adherence outcomes remains a limitation of the study, and results may have differed if other adherence assessment approaches had been used. Third, because the study used a convenience sample rather than a probability based sample, there are limits of the degree to which findings are generalizable to other populations. Related, the sample was predominately male, and thus caution should be exercised when generalizing the findings to women. Finally, because the eligibility criteria did not select based on levels of adherence at baseline, there was a limit of the degree to which patients could improve on their adherence, as some reported perfect adherence at study entry. However, even with the potential ceiling effect of adherence scores in the sample, the intervention was shown to significantly protect against the likelihood of subsequent nonadherence." (pg 89)</P>

<P>The authors noted the following: (pg 537) "Although adherence improvements were relatively stable over the 9 months of followup, the sexual risk reduction outcomes were shorter lived, dissipating before 9 months after the intervention. The durability of behavioral outcomes may prove more optimistic when the intervention is delivered in clinical care given the opportunities for ongoing support. Another limitation of this trial was its reliance on self reported measures for sexual risk and biological outcomes. Although the consistency of findings supports the study's internal validity, further testing of this intervention should be undertaken with biological endpoints. We emphasized ecological validity in designing the intervention, focusing on simple and lowcost strategies for reducing risk and improving adherence. Although we strived to maintain implementation simplicity, the intervention included 2 individual and 5 group sessions. Operations research is needed to examine whether the intervention can be shortened and whether it can be infused within existing clinical services, such as support groups, medication adherence groups, and case management." Also the final individual session was attended by 62 and 63 per cent of participants from the intervention and control groups respectively</P>

Although this heterogeneity may reduce statistical power, it may improve generalizability of the findings for application in a broad array of AYA patients with cancer. Direct measures of adherence to TMP/SMX and oral 6-MP were obtained from the subset of the sample who were prescribed these medications, thus making it impossible to determine whether patients who are prescribed other medications would show similar patterns of adherence to their medications if exposed to the intervention game. Male patients were overrepresented among study participants, perhaps because of greater appeal of video games to that audience; however, intervention effects were similar for both genders but with a somewhat greater impact on oral TMP/SMX adherence for female patients. A final limitation involves suboptimal adherence to the video game intervention, which was used less than the requested amount by most participants in this study."</P>

<P>The authors note the following: (pg 417) "A weakness of the study is the drop-out rate over follow-up; the statistical method used to deal with the subsequent missing values has already been discussed. A high rate of patient refusal and drop-out would not be unexpected with this relatively unselected and highly disturbed patient sample, of which 59.5% were admitted involuntarily. In fact, the actual initial refusal rate was I5%, and subsequent attrition by one-third included only 11 overt refusers. The therapy sessions were very well accepted by patients, with all those recruited completing the course of therapy. Substantial follow-up drop-out rates have been re- ported in: (a) drug studies; (b) prospective studies of inner-city samples where at least 10% relocate beyond catchment area boundaries each year; and (c) studies of psychosocial interventions in similar populations (Tarrier et al, 1993). Longer follow- up periods inevitably lead to greater attrition. A practical issue is that of tracking subjects for follow-up in a highly mobile inner-city sample. Another methodological issue concerns the measure of compliance. This was an indirect composite measure based on information from a number of sources, which correlated strongly at each time point with measures of treatment attitudes, lending it concurrent validity. A mean advantage for the compliance therapy group of between one and two points on the observer-rated compliance scale is a clinically meaningful difference (for example it could amount to the difference between a patient with a bipolar disorder accepting lithium with some supervision rather than being reluctantly maintained on a less appropriate depot medication schedule). However, it may be argued that lack of a direct compliance measure is a weakness in this study, though all these measures have their drawbacks. Pill counts have been widely used in the past even though despite the well-recognised potential for inaccuracy (Rudd, 1976; Kane, 1983; Pullar et a[, 1989). Furthermore, they are time-consuming, demanding of manpower, and ultimately not particularly suitable for: (a) in-patient studies where medication is largely administered by staff; (b) studies involving patients on depot medication; (c) patients with individually tailored regimes. Serum assays are expensive, invasive and are not available for the full range of antipsychotics; we believe their use in this study would have further adversely affected the drop-out rate. Urine tests for a drug or its metabolite may overestimate compliance with drugs like antipsychotics with a long half-life (Churchill, 1985); also currently available assays may not detect some antipsychotics at the lower dose range. Both serum and urine assays are of limited value in assessing partial compliance (Babiker, 1986). While simple self report compliance measures are poorly predictive of behavior, Hogan et a1 (1983) found that DAI ratings could accurately assign 89% of a large out-patient sample to compliant and non-compliant groupings. Observer bias Observer bias was another potential problem. The initial ratings and most of the three-month follow-up ratings of functioning and compliance were made by the research psychiatrist (R.K.) who was not blind to treatment status, though the compliance ratings were based on information from impartial sources including community psychiatric nurses and out-patient doctors on the clinical teams. However, all six-month, 12-month and 18-month ratings on the other hand were carried out by two researchers trained in their use, who were blind to treatment status. Inspection of the results shows consistency between ratings over the serial points, and satisfactory inter-rater reliability coefficients were obtained. Despite these shortcomings, the findings suggest that compliance therapy does have a measurable and positive effect on treatment adherence."</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The authors noted several limitations: "Although the prospective, randomized, controlled study design was chosen according to research standards in clinical trials, blinding is still a problem in intervention studies. Patients who participate in clinical studies benefit regardless of the treatment and whether they are assigned to the control or intervention group. This is probably because they receive special attention. This makes it more difficult to demonstrate the effect of an intervention, such as pharmaceutical care, because patients belonging to the control group are more likely to have better outcomes than the overall population. However, even in a small study population, results showing a statistical significance probably resulted from the pharmaceutical care provided. Because of the randomized design, patients of the intervention and control group visited the outpatient clinic at the same time and were able to exchange written and oral information. Moreover, patients in the control group received the basic immunosuppressant from the same hospital pharmacist as the intervention group. If those patients had questions or problems, not caring for them would have been unethical. Finally, it has to be discussed if it is necessary and justifiable not to tell the patients that we will be examining their compliance? Apart from the ethical problem, the high dropout rate caused by using pill boxes results from not informing the patients how the MEMS system works. However, this method is essential to receive valid data. Otherwise, patients could easily manipulate the results. To protect the patients' privacy, all data were coded and documented anonymously. Physicians and staff who cared for the patients had no access to the data, and the study design was approved by the ethical committee. Pill counts proved to be unfeasible, especially during the first weeks following transplantation, when the dose of the immunosuppressive drug was changed frequently. Therefore, documentation was time consuming and probably incomplete. However, this method was helpful for confirming the electronic data. Results of serum concentration measures also confirmed the MEMS results, especially because this method is a direct method of measuring compliance and proves ingestion of the drug. The questionnaire designed by Morisky was easy to administer and analyze. The biggest disadvantage is that the results are subjective. The number of patients assessed as compliant was much higher with the survey than with electronic compliance measurement. However, the questionnaire might be helpful in detecting compliance problems in daily clinical practice. Patients reporting to have forgotten their drug intake, or to have stopped their drug intake when feeling better, can be instructed especially on these issues. We were not surprised that only few patients reported to have forgotten to take their immunosuppressants. Our study reaffirms the previously reported findings that self reports are not reliable measures of compliance." (pg 846)</P>

<P>The author indicate the following limitations: (pg1800) "Though informative, our study had some limitations which merit consideration. Our study was originally powered to detect a 15% increase in adherence after the intervention, but then adherence levels were higher than anticipated for the control group thereby rendering the small but 'real' increase in adherence between the two groups statistically non-significant. It is possible this study was likely underpowered for adherence outcomes. Considering the fact that very high levels of adherence were exhibited by both treatment groups, any small difference could be of clinical and substantive importance. We were not able to corroborate attendance and adherence monitoring with more objective indicators such as immunological, virological or clinical outcomes because of financial constraints particularly the cost of additional laboratory monitoring in this setting. The clinic-based pill count measure though less objective compared to Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and HIV viral loads, it has been reported to be correlated with viral loads. Considering the fact that all participants were willing to identify treatment supporters, i.e. they all reported disclosure before enrollment, it is possible this could have attenuated potential benefits of treatment supporters since disclosure alone is a major predictor of adherence; it may be that we collected data from a cohort of highly motivated people who were prepared to gain the most from ART. The data was derived from a single site and so the results may not be generalizable to the whole country. Despite the various limitations, our study findings are very important and lend support to the results reported by Taiwo et al. in their randomized trial on treatment partners, that the use of patient-selected treatment supports is associated with improved adherence."</P>

(pg 565) "There was no significant difference between the BTMs of the control and intervention participants in this study at 3 and 6 months. The lack of significant correlation may be due to the already high medication adherence observed in both the control and intervention group and hence did not affect the BTMs. In addition, the half-life of bisphosphonates is very long and its serum levels are only transiently elevated after each dose. As a result, if adherence is interrupted at weekly intervals, most of the active sites will be only a few days old on an average and relatively little resorption will occur and hence, this small change will not be detected by the BTMs. Changes in the BTMs will only be detected if the patient stops bisphosphonate therapy for more than a month."

<P>The authors note the following limitations: the use of control, outcome measurement noted as limitations. (pg 204) "This study had several limitations. A usual-care arm would have been helpful to further substantiate the improvement in SBP found in both intervention arms. In recent studies involving patients with elevated baseline SBP levels, however, levels dropped by 2, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14 mm Hg with usual care, reductions considerably smaller than the approximately 20-mm Hg SBP reduction in both groups of our study. In an effort to pattern our study intervention to standard clinical care, we used blood pressures measured by medical assistants at the office visit. This approach may have introduced more random error creating a bias toward not finding a difference between study arms. It is unlikely that it affected the result to the point of masking a true significant difference, however. The potential impact on the before-after analysis would be toward the null hypothesis, making our results a conservative estimate of actual change from baseline to 6 months. The association between number of coaching encounters and SBP reduction, while supportive of a true effect of health coaching, relied on observational data and could reflect confounding by unmeasured variables. Although we expected health coaching to improve medication adherence, self reported adherence decreased over the course of the study. Two factors may explain this seemingly paradoxic finding. First, on the basis of coaches' reports, many patients at baseline did not know their medications well enough to accurately report adherence. Second, patients may have become more truthful as they developed trusting relationships with their coaches. Also, self reported adherence correlates poorly with more objective adherence measures."</P>

<P>The authors note that "...the present study was limited by the facts that there were not enough subjects and that the study period might not be sufficiently long enough to detect the small difference in adherence rates between the combination pill and control groups. In the present study, the patients were treated over 6 months. If the treatment period is to be longer, medication adherence might be improved in the combination pill group compared with the control group. Moreover, the present study provides little information regarding medication persistence. In order to achieve optimal outcomes in the treatment of hypertension, patients were required to take their medications not only properly (medication adherence) but also to continue to do so throughout long-term treatment (persistence)." adherence rate is the selection bias of the patients participating in the present study, because all patients were screened for run-in phases 1 and 2. The patients with a low adherence rate might be excluded during run-in periods. Therefore, this excellent medication adherence rate observed in the present study might not be applicable to general Japanese hypertensive patients. In addition, many participants were not newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, but rather had been treated with antihypertensive drugs for several years.25 Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that merely participating in a clinical trial significantly increases adherence.26 Even considering these limitations, however, the findings of the present study are largely new and provide important information on medication adherence regarding a combination pill of antihypertensive drugs" - p.1420-1421 "Electronic monitoring seems to be the most accurate method to evaluate medication adherence. 27 Unfortunately, however, the cost of this device precluded its use in the present study. Accordingly, the indirect method of pill counts was applied in the present study. This method can be applied to estimate the quantities of medications a patient presumably takes". (pg 1421)</P>

<P>Authors note in the discussion that the study used mainly validated and reliable instruments, tested inter-rater reliability, and included control of medication dose. However, a blind assessment of psychopathology (BPRS) and psychosocial function (GAF) was not attained. The use of a non-validated ad hoc instrument to measure knowledge and a compliance measure based on case records, which did not include urine testing or pill count, to some extent also limits the validity of findings. Furthermore, the power of the study and the generalizability of the findings are limited by the low eligibility of patients to the study and the resulting small sample size. The represent activity analysis indicated that the sample was skewed in the direction of more self destructive behavior diagnoses, fewer substance abuse diagnoses and towards shorter illness duration (pg 291)</P>

<P>Many limitations of the study noted in the discussion. "It is acknowledged that there are a number of potential limitations to our study. Only 42% of those approached agreed to take part in the study. For ethical reasons, we are unable to provide data about baseline adherence levels in those who declined, and age and gender were not shown to influence outcomes in our sample. Anecdotally, the main reasons given for not participating were reluctance to provide urine samples, make additional visits to the hospital, or complete questionnaires. We have no reason to believe that differences between those who agreed or did not agree to take part resulted in recruitment bias due to patient characteristics. This was an exploratory study for which the sample size was not powered to detect a clinical difference relating to flare-ups. We acknowledge that our definition of a flareup is based on the unscheduled hospital appointment or admission, which is open to challenge. In addition, the sample recruited contained a low proportion of people assessed as nonadherent at baseline. However, our findings suggest a useful area for future research involving a larger sample size of people with lower baseline adherence levels and collection of more detailed data relating to flare-ups in order to further investigate the question of clinical impact. Additionally, a general problem with evaluating complex interventions is that it is difficult to accurately assess the contribution made by the various components. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that combining adherence enhancing interventions tailored to individual patients was an effective way of improving persistence with 5-ASA medication. The difficulty of accurately measuring adherence to 5-ASA medication has been previously confirmed in our program of work; however, the objective measure used was probably the most appropriate method available for evaluating the intervention. We are unable to confirm whether the positive trend, but lack of significance, for results relating to changes in health beliefs was due to the small sample size or to the limited effectiveness of those aspects of the intervention aimed at addressing patient perceptions; further studies exploring methods of modifying health beliefs are therefore required. It could be suggested that our study does not take account of the potential impact of once-daily dosing regimes for patients with UC. Simplification of treatment can lead to improved patient adherence in a variety of disorders, and similar results have been reported in the treatment of UC. While we acknowledge that once-daily regimes were not available to patients in our study, we do not believe that this reduces the validity of our findings. A range of factors influence the prescribing decisions made by clinicians, including national and local guidelines, cost, and availability. Moreover, a survey of 100 Canadian patients with UC revealed that factors such as medication efficacy and safety were rated as being more important than those related to the dosing regime or cost. In this survey, speed of symptom relief and infrequency of side effects were rated as the most important factors when considering UC medication. 37 It may also be pertinent to note that changing to a once-daily dosing schedule could potentially lead to an actual decrease in adherence, as a single missed dose would equate to a full 24 hours of missed therapy. Finally, the need to consider cost-effectiveness in the evaluation of adherence interventions has been suggested. 13 While formal assessment of cost-effectiveness was not within the scope of the present study, the actual costs could be described as relatively low since the intervention involved only a brief educational session and provision of inexpensive leaflets and practical reminders. It would therefore seem reasonable to suggest that the intervention could be implemented in routine clinical care at relatively low cost". (pg 1880)</P>

The randomization method used was apparently not optimal as more women were drawn into the study group and more patients in the control group took single antidiabetic agent and tended to have higher pill count. Net A1C reduction set in the study may be too large to be obtained with the interventions. We measured two points of A1C, i.e., at the baseline and at the end, and as a consequence there was a lack of observation that could have possibly led to a more accurate trend of A1C change. The pill count method to gauge medication adherence may be inadequate. Though blinding to the randomization groups, the physicians and nurses were aware of pharmacist carrying out the study thus increases in overall care might be possible. Our intention was not to affect or evaluate the process of physician care for diabetes but it would be useful to measure changes in their diabetes management that may also have an impact on the outcome measures. The pharmacist's extra input involved combined strategies. Thus, it was impossible to label which component was associated with the improvements although multifaceted interventions were proved to enhance patient outcomes in diabetes care. It should be borne in mind that the management of diabetes mellitus in real practice is life-long and complex in nature. The results may not be conclusively generalisable, but they imply that similar strategies employed for general diabetes patients might have favourable effects on cardiovascular risks in this specific group."

<P>States that a "...fifth study limitation pertains to randomization procedures. Since we randomized by patient and not by site, patients in the usual care group may have been exposed to improved antidepressant education and monitoring when they returned for refills. Thus, it is possible that the usual care group received enhanced care by study pharmacists." "Indeed, the invitation to participate in this study may have biased results in several ways due to the Hawthorne effect. Both study groups may have reported greater clinical improvement since they wanted to meet the expectations of interested pharmacists (especially since patients were unblinded to group assignment). This phenomenon may explain why study groups had greater antidepressant adherence than has been reported in the literature" (pg 352)</P>

<P>(pg 703) "We should emphasize that these findings only apply to patients able and willing to communicate by online messaging. Nearly 80% of Americans have home internet access, 29 and surveys find high interest in e-mail communication with health care providers. 30 Financial incentives authorized by the 2009 Recovery Act may further increase availability of online health communication, especially if those incentives define meaningful use of electronic records to include online patient&#8211;provider communication. 31 Nevertheless, disadvantaged populations may have less access to online health services. In our sample of patients starting antidepressant treatment, those not registered for online services more often lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Approximately half of those registered to use online services enrolled in this trial, compared to 60% to 65% participation in similar trials of telephone care management. Non-participation may have reflected reservations about online depression follow-up or reservations about participation in a clinical trial. Participation may have been greater if (as in previous trials of telephone interventions) the initial invitation had come from the patient's health care team rather than a researcher and was followed by vigorous telephone outreach. The overall completion rate for care management contacts was approximately 85% compared to 95% in previous telephone programs. Despite these lower completion rates, clinical benefits (considering all patients randomized) were similar. This study was conducted in an integrated health care system with shared records of medical and mental health care as well as established collaborative relationships between primary care and mental health providers. The efficiency and clinical benefit of this program might be difficult to replicate outside of an integrated system. Follow-up in the usual care group was more intensive than in typical primary care practice, probably reflecting both above average follow-up rates in this setting 2,5 and a greater likelihood of research participants to return for follow-up. Testing this intervention among patients receiving above-average follow-up care could create a conservative bias (i.e. reduce the likelihood of showing a benefit)".</P>

<P>"Potentially, patients may have refilled their medications more regularly with Meds-Help but failed to increase their medication ingestion. However, our a priori CAM included components related to ingestion and still showed robust increases with the intervention. In addition to patients with schizophrenia, we included patients with bipolar disorder on long-term antipsychotics. These patients had lower levels of psychotic symptoms at baseline, which could potentially limit our ability to detect symptomatic changes. However, decreases in PANSS scores from baseline to 12 months were similar for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We note that the increase in overall dose from improved adherence may simply have been too small to impact symptoms (25% more outpatient days with medications ''on hand''), the follow-up period may have been too short to fully capture the benefits of increased adherence, or the relatively stable outpatients enrolling in this study may have been receiving the maximum benefit from their antipsychotic medications despite incomplete adherence. Patients with SMI may need broader- based interventions than those focused on medication adherence if their outcomes are to be improved. Other Limitations Measures of adherence in this study are approximations of actual adherence behaviors. A direct measure of patients' medication taking behavior would be the ultimate gold standard but is seldom achievable in adherence research.33 Although our participation rate is similar to that of most RCTs, patients recruited into a randomized trial may not be typical of all patients with SMI. More paranoid patients or those who were completely unwilling to take medications may have been underrepresented in the study sample&#8212;and this should be considered when generalizing study results to clinical populations. However, study participants' reported attitudes toward antipsychotic medications were similar to those reported for another population of patients with schizophrenia.25 Our study was not double blind, and a blinded assessment of outcomes would have been desirable. However, primary study outcomes were based on longer term patterns of medication filling which may be less susceptible to subtle biases on the part of interviewers or patients." (pg 734)</P>

<P>"These results must be examined within the context of the study's methodological limitations. A significant number of inpatient recruits did not make it to the point of randomization into treatment for this outpatient treatment study. Results can only apply to those individuals treated as outpatients or inpatients who have successfully negotiated the transition from inpatient to outpatient status. Participants in the study had been ill on average for more than a decade. The extent to which these techniques would be helpful to individuals with a more recent onset of schizophrenia should be examined in future research. In future studies including a baseline period of assessment for medication adherence prior to randomization would be important. In-home pill counts could not be conducted by blinded observers given the nature of environmental supports. However, pharmacy records were not subject to observer bias. It is also likely that more adherent individuals agreed to participate in the study; a common problem in adherence research. Moreover, assessments of medication adherence involve error that may overestimate or underestimate actual adherence. Methodological problems with pill counts and pharmacy records are outlined elsewhere.29 The fact that medication adherence improved, while psychotic symptoms did not suggests that our notions about adequate adherence and optimal dosing may have been formed in the ambiguous environment of partial adherence or negotiation and may need to be altered to maximize the outcomes of our patients. Despite these methodological limitations, the study provides strong support for the benefits of CAT and Pharm-CAT with respect to improving medication adherence and for the benefits of CAT for improving functional outcomes."

To maintain blinding, the pharmacist who performed the final evaluation was different from the recruiting pharmacist and had access only to the patient's name and telephone number and the name and dosage of his or her antibiotic treatment. At the end of the interview, the pharmacist was asked if, in her opinion, blinding was maintained. If a DRP was identified at the final evaluation, the patient was referred to his or her treating pharmacist.

<P>(PRIMARY) DOSING AID - The information was downloaded directly from the DA to computer software, which has a low risk for bias. However, the data were manipulated somewhat: "In phase 2, participants with 75% or fewer administered doses were randomized to either intervention or usual care. The data used for this determination included values obtained during the 8 weeks starting 2 weeks after enrollment and ending 2 weeks before the follow-up visit. Only these data were used because we detected that there was significantly greater adherence just after a visit and just before a visit. A dose was considered taken if the lever of the DA was depressed and recorded beta4 hours from that patient's median dosing hour (as determined from the DA data). Because we recognized from our previous study that the device has the potential to make extra recordings when the lever is depressed erroneously, we did not count more than 1 dose taken per eye per day in our adherence rate calculation. When the lever was depressed outside the time window it was assumed that a dose was not taken, and when the lever was depressed multiple times in the time window only a single dose for 1 or both eyes was assumed to have been delivered."

<P>(PRIMARY) MEMS - Author's note: patients were not blind. Also, the article suggests patients may have taken medication out of MEMS bottle to use other devices, and were then asked to remember to open the bottle when they took medication. (pg 10) "We monitored adherence primarily using the MEMS Track Cap for electronic drug monitoring. Participants were asked to use this cap during the 13 months while enrolled in the study. The cap is cumbersome to use, and affects the portability of one's medications. Therefore, participants may have skipped using their caps for periods of time during the study. In addition, caps can malfunction, rendering data unavailable. Since many patients use pill boxes or pill trays to facilitate their adherence, it is difficult to remember to open the cap when removing pills from the pill box. For these reasons, future researchers who choose to use EDM might consider shortening the time for EDM, or using newer more user-friendly technology available to conduct EDM."</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>(PRIMARY) SELF REPORT - INTERVIEW - The authors indicate this measure may have been biased: (pg 1842) The primary analysis classed all-cause attrition as treatment failures. Thus, the higher follow-up rates and lower mortality reported in the intervention group contributed to the positive intervention effect for the primary outcomes. When only available data were included in the complete-case analyses, a significant reduction was preserved in viral suppression but not in self reported adherence. This could be because of a recall or social desirability bias in self reporting adherence among those who were followed up. Alternatively, patients might have been less likely to respond to follow-up if they had not adhered to ART. Nonetheless, we chose an intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome because contributions of loss to follow-up are important indicators for the durable implementation of ART programs</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>(PRIMARY) MEMS - Author's note: key study personnel were not blinded to the study groups. Also, the article outlines complicated method for determining adherence based on MEMS results. "Electronic Drug Monitoring (EDM)&#8212;One medication from the regimen was electronically monitored using the MEMS cap and an algorithm was used to determine which medication would receive the cap. In general, that medication was the primary protease inhibitor (PI), or the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) if a PI was not prescribed. A sticker was placed on the monitored medication bottle and the participant was instructed to write dates and times on the sticker when the medication was pocketed, or if the cap was opened by mistake. At each download, information on this sticker was reviewed and an EDM questionnaire was completed. The information collected on the questionnaire included changes in medication regimen, problems with the cap, if someone else had administered the medication, and if the medication had been stopped. If the medication had been stopped, the participant was asked who stopped it and the reason, and if it had been restarted. If the participant was taken off the medication and brought the cap to the study office, it was stored until the participant re-started medication and those days were marked as 'non-monitored.' EDM data were adjusted by setting certain days as 'non-monitored' on which the following events occurred: cap malfunction, lost cap, medication stopped by healthcare provider, someone else administered the medication (e.g., hospital, group home), incarceration, pocketing pills, reported exclusive use of pill box, and excessive openings (a form of cap malfunction defined as more than twice the dose plus one). The EDM data were captured over time in phases consistent with the five assessment periods. Data from the MEMS report on the Percentage (%) of Prescribed Doses Taken and Percentage (%) of Prescribed Doses Taken on Schedule were used for this analysis. The MEMS Track caps were used by participants during the entire study period (about 13 months) including 2 weeks prior to the baseline to obtain an estimate of baseline adherence."</P>

Of 594 baselined participants, 328 (55%) met the inclusion criteria for the on protocol (OP) sample (see Figure 1). Participant characteristics for the ITT, OP-included, and OP-excluded samples are presented in Table 2. Those included in the OP sample are similar in most respects to those excluded with the exception that those included reflected larger numbers of women, unemployed, individuals on disability, and were slightly older. The OP sample also had a higher number of individuals with undetectable viral load at baseline. Note that these elements did not differ by study arm within the OP sample. No differences in baseline values by study arm assignment were noted in the ITT sample; study arm was not related to inclusion or exclusion in the OP sample, and the only differences between study arm in the OP sample were total income (lower income in the intervention arm) and self reported sexual orientation (lower proportion of gay participants in the intervention arm)</P>

<P>(PRIMARY) SYMPTOM DIARY CARD - There was some loss of subjects returning diary cards during the study, but the loss was similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). We considered that selective dropout of patients during the study may explain the significant results at 6 months, however Table 7 shows data at 3 months for those subjects having data at 6 months only. The differences are very similar to those for the whole group at 3 months, and not like those at 6 months. Thus we cannot ascribe the differences between treatment and control subjects at 6 months to selective dropout (pg 904)</P>

Patients who were randomized to the intervention group were educated on their illness and their medication in a structured fashion, including discussion on risk of diabetes complications, proper dosage, side effects and storage of medications, healthy lifestyle and management of diabetes mellitus signs and symptoms through self monitoring. A printed leaflet to assist with the education program was developed and the patient was given a copy to take home. Supplementary leaflets containing information about hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also given to the patients if they suffered from these conditions. The educational advice was reinforced when patients came to the hospital pharmacy to collect their prescribed medicines on their monthly schedule. In addition, behavioral modification aspects of the Pharmacist Care intervention involved advice on the following: self monitoring of glycemic control (patients were encouraged to monitor their blood glucose levels 3 times per day, to record these values and bring a record book to all subsequent appointments); physical exercise (this involved initiation of an exercise plan that could be incorporated into the patient&#8217;s daily schedule, after taking into consideration their level of fitness, e.g. 1-hour walk daily; diet (the patient was assisted with the identification of dietary behavior that adversely influences blood glucose control, lipid levels, weight management, and of the times of day when the patient was most vulnerable to overeating, and given improved understanding of the relative effects of certain food choices on blood glucose control); medication adherence (patients were asked about any problems that they had encountered with regard to taking their medication and were offered education and practical help to encourage them to take the medicines prescribed for them by their physician); and smoking cessation (patients were encouraged to stop smoking by advising them about the danger of smoking to health, with emphasis on the increased dangers of smoking in diabetic patients)<BR/>(n = 120)<BR/>

<P>PROBLEM-SOLVING INTERVENTION: Participants met with a research co-ordinator for 4 sessions of a problem-solving (PS)intervention. PS comprised 4 30-minute sessions. The individualized intervention involved 4 interactive steps, usually 1 per research session. For the 158 participants who reported missing doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the goal was to improve adherence. For the 7 participants who declared adherence to the prescribed regimen, the goal was to maintain adherence. The first PS step consisted of defining the problem: improving or preserving adherence to ICS use within the patient's unique context and orientation. Problem orientation facilitated the adoption of a rational, positive, and constructive appraisal of how to achieve adherence, with non-adherence being presented as a problem to be solved. PS was presented as a means of coping with problems more generally and modifying attitudes or beliefs that inhibit or interfere with attempts to solve problems. It was a motivational technique to help the participant view the occurrence of problems as inevitable, normal, and solvable. This first step involved breaking problems into small achievable pieces. The second step was brainstorming for alternative solutions. The third step was choosing the best solution by weighing the consequences, both desirable and undesirable, of each candidate solution. Between the third and 4th meetings, the solution was tried. For the 4th step, the chosen solution was evaluated and revised. As part of this intervention, downloaded data from monitored ICSs were shared with the participant in a nonjudgmental fashion at each visit. At these sessions, subjects followed the same PS steps for addressing an additional problem of their own choosing, such as increasing physical activity. The problems were sometimes interrelated; for example, a father wants to play sports with his child, and improving asthma management makes this easier<BR/>(n = 165)<BR/>

The Family Co-ordinator helped caregivers interpret the diaries and communicate the contents to their doctors. 3 group education workshops were held at 1-month intervals that followed the asthma self regulation model. Families were trained to use the diaries and peak flow meters. Family Co-ordinators regularly called families to discuss their diary records. The second workshop used patients' diary records as illustrations of the relative effectiveness of controller medicines over rescue/quick-relief drugs in preventing asthma symptoms over time. Participants reviewed their own records of medicines and symptoms. The third workshop described asthma management as a two-pronged effort of pharmacotherapy and trigger control. Between the 1st and 2nd workshops, the Family Co-ordinator prepared families for their doctor visit. The Family Co-ordinator accompanied families to the doctor visit where he intervened if the family failed to communicate a thorough asthma history. The children in the intervention group were tested for allergies by an attending allergist at the hospital if they had not recently been tested by their own physician.

<P>COUNSELING: In the adherence counseling intervention, trained counselors administered 2 counseling sessions to participants prior to HAART initiation and a third session 1 month after HAART initiation. Counseling sessions around HAART initiation were based on a model of successful antiretroviral adherence promotion at a large University of Washington-affiliated HIV treatment program in Seattle, Washington. All counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The second session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The third session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The adherence counseling intervention had been previously used and adapted at the same site in Kenya for over 2 years and was delivered in English and Kiswahili<BR/>(n = 100)<BR/>
<BR/>COUNSELING PLUS ALARM: Participants in counseling plus alarm group received both adherence counseling and alarm reminders. 3 adherence counseling sessions (2 prior to HAART initiation and 1 after HAART initiation) were conducted. All counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about the HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The 2nd session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The 3rd session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The counseling session was delivered in English and Kiswahili. In addition, participants were given a small pocket digital alarm, which the individual was to carry at all times for 6 months. The device was programmed by the study staff to beep and flash twice a day at a time convenient to the participant when medications were to be taken. The digital alarm could not be reprogrammed or inactivated by the individual and was utilized for 6 months after HAART initiation before being disabled by study staff<BR/>(n = 100)<BR/>
<BR/>ALARM DEVICE: Participants in the alarm device intervention received a small pocket digital alarm which the individual was to carry at all times for 6 moths duration. The device was programmed by the study staff to beep and flash twice a day at a time convenient to the participant when medications were to be taken. The digital alarm could not be reprogrammed or inactivated by the individual and was utilized for 6 months after HAART initiation before being disabled by study staff<BR/>(n = 100)<BR/>

<P>TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH: The transdisciplinary intervention consisted of clinical follow-up, smoking cessation assistance, dietary advice and life style modification advice. The intervention was delivered by a team consisting of an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, a nurse and a dietician. There were 2 follow-up assessment - at 60 to 90 days after MI and 120 to 180 days after MI. In diabetic patients, capillary glycemia was measured (Advantage reagent strips, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), lower limbs were examined, and adherence to prescribed oral antidiabetic agents and insulin was reviewed. Those patients who were still smoking were advised to stop smoking by the nurse and also by the cardiologist. No oral medication was prescribed in this regard since these drugs are not routinely provided by the Public Health System in Brazil. After the above-described procedures, the dietitian evaluated body weight and performed a nutritional review. This review was followed by reinforcement of healthy nutritional habits, which included information on the characteristics and amount of healthy meals according to each case and also lifestyle modification reinforcement. The management plan was formulated as an individualized therapeutic alliance among the patient and family, the physician, and other members of the health care team. Finally, patients were evaluated by the cardiologist, who completed the visit with the specific medical history, physical examination and specific complementary tests. Drug prescription by the cardiologist followed the AHA guidelines for both groups (statins, antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Diabetic patients were evaluated by an endocrinologist. Drug prescription by the endocrinologist followed the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for both groups<BR/>(n = 78)<BR/>

<P>MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING: Intervention group receives usual adherence education and motivational interview. Participants received 5 individual MI counseling sessions with a study nurse counselor over a 3-month period. The goal of these sessions was to help participants gain an understanding of their medication-taking behaviors and the actions necessary to successfully maintain a high level of adherence. The counselor used a MI script to guide the interaction with the participants. During the session participants were encouraged to identify and discuss barriers to adherence, to express and resolve ambivalence about taking medications, and to support motivation to attain or maintain adherence. After each medication was discussed and an action plan developed, the counselor ended each session by summarizing the discussion and the action plan agreed upon by the participant and counselor. Session 1 was completed in-person for all participants. Telephone sessions (for sessions 2 though 5) were conducted as needed for participants who were unable to meet the counselor in the clinic. Participants were paid USD 10 for completing the first MI session and USD 5 for each of the remaining 4 sessions.

<P>HEALTH AND RECOVERY PROGRAM (HARP): Participants in the intervention group attended up to 6 group sessions led by mental health peer specialists. Sessions covered the following topics related to chronic disease self management: 1. Overview of self management 2. Exercise and physical activity 3. Pain and fatigue management 4. Healthy eating on a limited budget 5. Medication management and 6. Finding and working with a regular doctor. During the sessions, peer educators modeled appropriate behaviors and responses, and participation from each group member helped model behavior and improve motivation for other members. Attendees are taught to develop short-term "action plans" for choosing domains of health behavior change. This process involves identifying a problem that is of particular concern, listing ideas for solving the problem, and then developing a plan outlining specific, short-term goals for improvement. 2 certified mental health peer specialists participated in a community-based, 5-day CDSMP master training course to become master trainers in the CDSMP program.

<P>MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION: MBSR aims to teach participants to respond to stressful situations ''mindfully'' - a state in which one focuses on the present moment, accepting and acknowledging it without getting caught up in thoughts that are about the situation or emotional reactions. This enables people to respond to the situation by making conscious choices to respond instead of reacting automatically. The MBSR program consists of the following elements: (1) individual pre-program intake interviews performed by the course instructor with each participant, lasting 30 minutes; (2) 8 weekly classes of 2.5 to 3 hours; (3) an all-day silent retreat during the 6th week of the program; and (4) daily home assignments including a minimum of 45 minutes per day of formal mindfulness practice and 5 to 15 minutes of informal practice, 6 days per week for the entire duration of the course. The total in-class contact is approximately 30 hours, and the total home assignments are a minimum of 42 to 48 hours. In addition, one to 2 additional individual interview sessions may be provided, at instructor discretion, to individual participants during the course. In addition to teaching mindfulness practices, the course includes didactic presentations that include information on stress physiology and stress reactivity.

<TD>
<P>TELEMEDICINE-ENHANCED ANTIDEPRESSANT MANAGEMENT (TEAM): Patients at intervention sites received a stepped-care model of depression treatment for up to 12 months. Treatment intensity was increased for patients failing to respond to lower levels of care by involving a greater number of intervention personnel with increasing mental health expertise. The intervention involved 5 types of providers: (1) PCPs located at CBOCs; 2) consult telepsychiatrists located at parent VAMCs; (3) an off-site depression nurse care manager (RN); (4) an off-site clinical pharmacist (PharmD); and 5) an off-site supervising psychiatrist. The consult-telepsychiatrist accepted consultations or referrals from PCPs. The supervising psychiatrist provided clinical supervision to the care manager and clinical pharmacist via weekly face-to-face meetings. Patients and providers could choose either watchful waiting or antidepressant treatment (Step 1). Nurse care manager encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted to enhance standardization and reproducibility. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) administered the PHQ9 symptom monitoring tool; (2) educated and activated using a semi-structured script4; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers using semi-structured scripts for endorsed barriers. Follow-up encounters to monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects were scheduled every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. Non-adherent patients or those experiencing severe side effects were administered semi-structured scripts.3 A trial was considered to have failed in the acute phase if the patient: (1) was non-adherent to the medication, (2) experienced severe side effects, (3) experienced 5-point increase in their PHQ9 score, or (4) did not respond (50% decrease in PHQ9 score) after 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy. All feedback was provided to PCPs using the electronic medical record. Progress notes reporting failed trials requested an electronic co-signature from the PCP. If the patient did not respond to the initial antidepressant, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note (Step 2). The pharmacist also provided non-scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side effects or problems with non-adherence. If the patient did not respond to 2 antidepressants trials, the protocol was to recommend a telepsychiatry consultation followed by additional treatment recommendations to the PCP (Step 3)<BR/>(n = 177 patients (3 practices))<BR/>

The healthcare assistants contacted their patients by telephone twice a week in the first month and then once a month for the following 11 months. They monitored depression symptoms and adherence to medication by using the Depression Monitoring Context List. Healthcare assistants also encouraged patients to follow self management activities, such as medication adherence and activation for pleasant or social activities. The assistants provided this information to the family physician in a structured report that stratified the urgency of the contact by a robot scheme.

The "course completed" rate is based on self report on a telephone call - no indication that interviewers were blinded to group; nor was the exact question given (if there was one). Technically, this study qualified for the review, but the reliability and credibility of the measures are suspect. At least the question of the control group's filling of prescriptions could have been cleared up.

Trained nurses assisted the patient to work through the booklet. Within the decision aid, patients were asked to write down their experiences with previous antipsychotic medication and to indicate their preferences regarding the different options on each topic. Nurses were advised to answer any questions of the patients and to encourage them to state any point of view contrary to that of the doctor. They were also instructed to postpone the participation of patients in the study if serious thought disturbances or delusional misinterpretations were detected while working through the booklet. The average time for working through the booklet was 30 to 60 minutes. Patients met their physicians within 24 hours after having worked through the decision aid with their nurse. The aim of these meetings, "planning talks", was to reach an agreement between patient and psychiatrist on the further treatment according to the preferences indicated by the patient in the booklet.

In the 2nd half, patients received brief training in basic peer communication skills and were paired with another age matched patient in their cohort. Peer partners were encouraged to call each other at least once a week using an interactive, voice-response&#8211;facilitated telephone platform that recorded call initiation, frequency, and duration; enabled partners to contact each other without exchanging telephone numbers and to set periods during which calls could be blocked; and generated automated reminders every 7 days if no peer calls were attempted. During a reminder call, patients could be transferred automatically to their peer partner's number. The system also allowed patients to leave voice messages for research staff or care managers. At the end of the initial session, patients were given a DVD that demonstrated peer communication skills and a diabetes self management workbook that they could use to help guide their peer telephone calls. Patients were also offered 3 optional 1.5-hour group sessions at months 1, 3, and 6. These were completely patient-driven sessions at which patients were encouraged to share concerns, questions, strategies, and progress on their action plans.

<P>HEARTMED PHARMACIST INTERVENTION: The pharmacist arranged a home visit, within 2 weeks of hospital discharge, at a time when they could meet the patient and any carer(s). Where appropriate, pharmacists educated the patient/carer about heart failure and their drugs and gave basic exercise, dietary, and smoking cessation advice. They also encouraged completion of simple sign and symptom monitoring diary cards (including monitoring body weight), removed discontinued drugs (with the patient's consent), fed back recommendations to the general practitioner, and fed back to the local pharmacist any need for a drug adherence aid (for example, a Medidos or Dosett container). We provided all pharmacists with a detailed manual describing the expected components of their visit and asked them to deliver education in line with advice given in the British Heart Foundation's booklet Living with Heart Failure, which they left with patients after the first visit. Pharmacists completed a standardized visit form during each visit. 1 follow-up visit occurred at 6 to 8 weeks after discharge to review progress and reinforce original advice.

<P>KHARMA INTERVENTION: The KHARMA intervention consisted of 8 group sessions using motivational interviewing delivered in a group format. It was designed to empower women to make decisions and develop strategies about taking ART as prescribed and consistently using risk reduction behaviors, such as condom use and to overcome resistance/ambivalence to both. The sessions lasted about 1.5 to 2 hours, and were led by trained MI nurses. The first and last session focused on both adherence and risk behavior, 3 sessions were devoted to adherence only and 3 to risk reduction behaviors only, including a session on disclosure which is important to risk reduction as well as adherence. Each session included a discussion of goals and goal setting related to the topic. MI techniques were incorporated into every session. In keeping with the autonomy support spirit of MI, participants as a group chose which topic they wanted to address first.

Psychiatrist attended a 90-minute training session during which they were informed about the rationale for taking into account the spiritual dimension in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and how to conduct a spiritual assessment. They were made aware of how their own religious and spiritual experiences could influence their identity and world view, as well as how their attitudes toward such experiences might introduce biases into clinical assessment and treatment. Finally, psychiatrists were reminded to show respect for patients with different religious and spiritual backgrounds. Psychiatrists used a semi-structured interview guided by the following topics: religious and spiritual history, effects of illness on spirituality or religiousness, current spiritual or religious beliefs and practices, subjective importance of religion in general, subjective importance of religion in coping with the illness, synergy of religion with psychiatric care. After each assessment the psychiatrist met with 2 of the authors, a psychiatrist and a psychologist of religion. In these sessions the individual patient was discussed for 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the clinical context.

Game content was engineered to address behavioral issues that were identified in literature reviews and preproduction targeting studies as critical for optimal AYA patient participation in cancer treatment. Video-game play includes destroying cancer cells and managing common treatment-related adverse effects such as bacterial infections, nausea, and constipation by using chemotherapy, antibiotics, antiemetics, and a stool softener as ammunition. To win, players control the nanobot, Roxxi, to ensure strategically that virtual patients engage in positive self care behaviors, such as taking oral chemotherapy to fight cancer cells, taking antibiotics to fight infection, taking stool softeners to prevent bowel perforations, practicing good mouth care to combat mucositis, using relaxation techniques to reduce stress, and eating food to gain energy. Neither the nanobot nor any of the virtual patients "die" in the game. If players "fail" at any point in the game, then the nanobot powers down and players are given the opportunity to try the mission again.

<P>PHARMACIST INTERVENTION: The intervention was individualized and tailored for each patient by the clinical pharmacist based on disease knowledge, smoking status, medication adherence, self efficacy in managing breathing difficulty, and exercise and diet habits. Intervention patients were educated individually by the clinical pharmacist (in a structured fashion) on COPD, their prescribed medication, the importance of adherence, inhaler technique (written information was provided) and the management of COPD symptoms. The clinical pharmacist ensured that the patient knew the indications and doses of each medicine, and was able and willing to use the inhaler devices prescribed. The clinical pharmacist also discussed with the intervention patients the importance of simple exercises that patients can do at home (e.g. upper and lower limb exercises and relaxation techniques), symptom control (pursed lip technique) and the technique for expectoration (huff and puff technique). The pharmacist demonstrated these techniques and then asked the patients to carry out the techniques to ensure that they fully understood how to perform them. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. Advice, using the motivational interviewing technique, was provided to the patients who still smoked and referral to a special smoking cessation program run within the hospital was made. A customized action plan for acute exacerbations, including advice to GPs to provide a prescription for an antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and an oral corticosteroid to be initiated promptly by patients for exacerbations,was developed for each patient. The clinical pharmacist through motivational interviewing attempted to increase the intervention patients' self efficacy to manage or avoid breathing difficulty while participating in certain activities. The interventions were tailored according to the preliminary assessment, i.e. checklists of patients' needs were prepared by the research pharmacist and forwarded to the clinical pharmacist to discuss with the patients. The initial intervention lasted for approximately 1 hour for non-smoker patients and slightly longer for patients who currently smoked. At each outpatient clinic visit (every 6 months arranged by the hospital consultant), intervention group patients received reinforcement of the education on COPD and its treatment from the clinical pharmacist. In addition, follow-up telephone calls by the clinical pharmacist to reinforce the education and motivate the patients to achieve their goals were made at 3 and 9 months, i.e. between outpatient clinic appointments<BR/>(n = 86)<BR/>

<P>PHARMACEUTICAL CARE: In addition to routine clinical care, patients in the intervention group received pharmaceutical care services provided by a dedicated hospital pharmacist. The pharmaceutical care program usually started about 1 week before discharge from the transplant surgery unit. The hospital pharmacist met with the patient 3 to 4 times and educated him on different issues regarding immunosuppressive medication, for example, action of the drugs, side effects, interactions, vital signs, laboratory data, and discharge medication. On discharge, the hospital pharmacist handed out and explained written information, including a discharge medication plan, information regarding the immunosuppressive therapy, and a diary for documenting vital signs and laboratory data. During the first year after transplantation, the patient met the pharmacist at least once per quarter year and at maximum once per month. During these meetings the pharmacist discussed with the patient changes in medication, laboratory values, and drug-related problems. Preferably, family members were involved. In addition, the hospital pharmacist reviewed the patients' drug therapy, to minimize drug-related problems, and simplify drug regimens<BR/>(n = 26)<BR/>

<P>TREATMENT SUPPORTER INITIATIVE: Patients in the TS arm received both the TS intervention and the standard adherence intervention package. Elements of the standard intervention package consisted of self monitoring of medication taking using adherence diaries; regular individual and group education by peer-workers using patient education leaflets and tabletop flip-charts; and late attendee tracing. The treatment supporters were usually family members&#8212;usually a partner, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friend, or neighbor/friend&#8212;who were chosen by the patient with the assistance of the health workers, had accepted the patient's HIV status and were confidantes. These individuals were committed to support the patient with ART for a long time, had gained the patient's trust over time, and commanded respect. Patients were asked to bring their chosen treatment supporter to the ART clinic for the health worker to explain about ART, adherence and treatment support. This includes commitment, confidentiality, knowledge on HIV and ART related needs, and perhaps emergency resource needs such as money, help with household, and children. Treatment supporters were educated with the following WHO Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) educational materials: Patient Education Flipchart, Patient Education Cards, and Caregiver Booklets. They were also educated on how to remind the patient to take their medicine, be present at the follow-up appointments, remember all important test results and clinic history over time, and to accompany patient to support group meetings if possible. Treatment supporter meetings were also held at the clinic every 2 or more weeks to deal with issues of burn out, patient non-adherence and other barriers to treatment and adherence<BR/>(n = 87)<BR/>

<P>PERCEPTUAL (MOTIVATIONAL) INTERVENTIONS: Participants who were assigned to the intervention group attended a one-on-one education and motivation session conducted by the researcher. First, this session aimed to identify perceptual and practical barriers to 5-ASA medication adherence and, second, to motivate, convince, and educate. The session was designed as a structured dialog allowing the patient to comment and ask questions. Educational topics included ulcerative colitis, 5-ASA medication, and adherence. Participants were also encouraged to identify practical barriers to 5-ASA medication use, as well as perceived barriers to adherence. Strategies for overcoming these barriers were also discussed. Sessions lasted for 20 to 30 minutes and were intended to deliver individualized support to each patient. At the end of the session patients were offered an educational leaflet to take away. Patients had the option of being accompanied to these educational sessions by a relative or friend and any accompanying person was also offered a leaflet specifically written for relatives and friends. During the session patients were offered a free choice of up to 3 practical adherence enhancing interventions; simplifying of dosing regime, medication reminder charts, visual medication reminders for refrigerators and bedside cabinets, daily electronic pill box organizers with alarms, weekly electronic pill box organizers, weekly non-electronic pill box organizers, mobile telephone alarm set-up, taking into consideration that practical problems and adherence may change over time. Participants had the option of changing these interventions at any time during the study and at weeks 4 and 24 they were formally asked whether they wished to change the interventions. 1 brief follow-up telephone call was made to patients in the intervention group at week 4. During the mid-study visit a 10-minute reinforcement session was held during which the importance of adherence to prescribed 5-ASA medication was reiterated, beliefs regarding medicine-taking were reassessed, and any practical problems were discussed.

All obtained data were summarized in a personal risk-factor passport: a graphical presentation of the patient's calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. It also showed the target risk that could be reached if all the patient's modifiable risk factors were optimally treated, as well as the standard age- and gender-related risk. 10-year risk and target risk were calculated using the Framingham risk score. The risk-factor passport contained the most recent ultrasound image of the patient's carotid artery, as well as an example of a healthy and an unfavorable image of the carotid artery, which were both explained and discussed by the nurse practitioner.

<P>HIV TRANSLATING INITIATIVES FOR DEPRESSION INTO EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS (HITIDES): The purpose of the HITIDES intervention was to support HIV and mental health clinicians in delivering evidence-based depression treatment. The HIV depression care team consisted of a registered nurse depression care manager, a clinical pharmacist, and a psychiatrist. This team was located offsite and convened once a week and as needed by telephone or in person. The depression care team communicated with treating clinicians via electronic medical record progress notes. The DCM communicated with patients via telephone. The HITIDES depression care team made treatment suggestions. Treatment decisions were made by the HIV or mental health clinicians at each site. The DCM delivered the following intervention components: participant education and activation, assessment of treatment barriers and possible resolutions, depression symptom and treatment monitoring, substance abuse monitoring, and instruction in self management. The DCM used prewritten scripts, which are standardized instruments that were supported by the Web-based decision support system during these telephone encounters. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment. At any time, HIV health care providers were free to refer participants directly to specialty mental health care. The DCM conducted telephone-based monitoring every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. The NetDSS system identified potential treatment non-response as (1) antidepressant regimen adherence of less than 80% during the past 14 days, (2) counseling non-adherence of less than 75% during the past month, (3) participant report of severe adverse effects during 2 consecutive DCM encounters, (4) participant report of a 5-point increase in depression severity from the enrollment PHQ-9 score based on 2 consecutive DCM encounters, or (5) lack of participant response during an 8-week antidepressant or 12-week counseling trial<BR/>(n = 138)<BR/>

<P>COUNSELING BASED ON ELECTRONIC DRUG MONITORING DATA: When intervention participants came to the clinic monthly, a study member downloaded and reviewed the subject's previous month's electronic drug monitoring device (EDM) data. Each subject found to be less than 95% adherent according to the EDM data was 'flagged' for counseling with a clinic physician or nurse utilizing the EDM information immediately following regular clinic visit activities. The data were provided to both the subject and his/her clinician as a printout summarizing the percent of doses taken, the percent of doses taken on time, and a visual display of doses taken by time. This process of flagging and counseling was specific to each clinic visit. In each counseling session, the clinician reviewed the EDM printout with the subject, explored reasons for missed or off-time doses, and inquired about problems or challenges the subject might be having. Beyond this, counseling sessions did not follow a script. This was designed to accommodate each clinician's counseling style, allow for an individually-focused discussion of adherence behavior, and encourage each subject-clinician pair to devise personalized strategies to improving adherence. In this regard, the EDM feedback provided data to inform and thereby enhance the counseling, but did not dictate precisely how the counseling should be performed. In the event that subjects did not immediately offer reasons for missed or off-time doses, clinicians were advised to say: "Let's talk more about any problems that you had last month".'

<P>MODIFIED DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY (M-DOT): Patients in the intervention arm received M-DOT services for the first 24 weeks of ART, in addition to standard care. Although consideration was given to provision of home-based M-DOT, formative research revealed that patients were concerned this would undermine their privacy and confidentiality. They also believed that clinic visits would provide beneficial access to health care workers, so M-DOT services were provided during twice weekly clinic visits. To enhance convenience, participants could select 1 of 6 health centers for their M-DOT visits. At each visit, participants met with M-DOT observers (nurses) who observed ingestion of the patient's ART dose, inquired about difficulties encountered, and provided individualized adherence support. Used medication containers were also collected, pill counts recorded, and medication dispensed for the subsequent 3 or 4 days. During the monthly clinic visits, efforts were made to ensure that participants in the M-DOT and control group received equal contact time with study staff to minimize the likelihood that any differences observed would be due to nonspecific effects of increased attention given to the intervention group. CHW traced M-DOT participants who missed visits and brought medications to participants who were unable to visit the facility. After cessation of M-DOT at week 24, patients had no further contact with M-DOT observation centers. Like the control group, they collected monthly medication refills at recruitment clinics and received standard adherence support during weeks 25 to 72. No compensation was given for study participation, though travel costs were reimbursed for 21 M-DOT participants with financial constraints (USD 0.65 per visit)<BR/>(n = 116)<BR/>

After ART initiation, patients visited treatment centers every 4 weeks for follow-up. At the first 2 follow-up visits, general adherence counseling was provided, as was discussion of specific emerging problems with side effects or medication intake; thereafter, counseling was tailored to individual needs.

The telephone interview contained an algorithm of 11 questions addressing medication compliance, reporting of adverse events, providing information on common medications, and offering general medication safety tips. The intent of the IVR algorithm was to provide early identification of issues permitting timely intervention, provide a mechanism for tracking medication compliance, and provide medication information at the time deemed most valuable by the patient at his or her request and to provide longer-term follow-up as the patient transitioned from hospital to home. Patients were asked questions about medication compliance such as, "Did you fill the prescriptions given to you at discharge?" and were offered additional information on 8 common medications prescribed to cardiac surgical patients on discharge. The answers to the questions were captured in a database.

<P>CARE MANAGEMENT: Intervention group received care management intervention in addition to usual care by the treating physician. The intervention was delivered online but the structure was similar to the telephone programs tested in earlier studies. After randomization, participants received a welcome letter describing the program and it contained general advice about the antidepressants medication and self care for depression. Monitoring contacts were scheduled 2, 6, and 10weeks later. At each monitoring contact, there was an outreach message from the nurse containing a link to an online assessment. The assessment included the PHQ depression questionnaire and questions regarding use of antidepressant medication, side effects, and reasons for medication discontinuation. Those not responding were sent up to 2 reminder messages. For each assessment completed, an algorithm generated a suggested response based on PHQ depression score, current antidepressant use, and side effects. The care manager could tailor this suggested response using information in the medical record or in messages since the last contact. The care manager communicated with the treating physician using an electronic messaging system within the electronic medical record. In consultation with the physician, the care manager might facilitate follow-up visits, support changes in medication, or facilitate referral for specialty care (including urgent referrals in case of suicidal ideation or severe symptoms). Each of the 3 care management contacts included this cycle: outreach message from the care manager, patient completion of online assessment, structured response from the care manager, and follow-up communication with the patient and physician as needed. The care manager's messages to patients included brief support but no formal psychotherapy. Patients were free to send additional messages or telephone the care manager if needed. The care manager was expected to make outreach telephone calls in case of suicidal ideation or other urgent clinical need. All outgoing messages were in English.

<P>PEER SUPPORT: The 3-month peer support intervention consisted of 2 parts: (a) 6 twice monthly 1-hour gatherings held at the clinic, consisting of all peers and actively enrolled participants in the peer support arm and (b) weekly phone calls from peers to participants. At the time of enrollment, participants were assigned to individual peers by study staff based on peer availability and presumed compatibility. In the group setting, participants had the opportunity to interact face-to-face with their assigned peer and meet the other peers and participants, with the goal of benefiting from the discussion of the shared experiences of the group. The meetings were designed to identify barriers to HAART adherence and generate problem-solving strategies to overcome them. Other emerging themes included life issues that impact adherence, including HIV status disclosure, dating, substance use, and struggles with mental health issues. One of several research staff members coordinated the groups by making reminder phone calls, preparing the meeting room, and providing refreshments. With assistance from the peers, they facilitated the meetings by refocusing the discussion on adherence-related topics when appropriate. Otherwise, they refrained from interfering with the group process and the exchange of support among peers and participants, resulting in predominantly peer led groups. Participants received a $15 incentive for attending each of the 6 sessions. All were welcomed to continue attending thereafter but were provided neither reminder phone calls nor monetary incentives for additional meetings. Between group meetings, peers were instructed to call each of their study participants weekly to provide more in-depth one-on-one attention and feedback. Phone calls also were better suited for participants with confidentiality concerns and those who had difficulty traveling to the clinic or had scheduling conflicts with the set meeting times. Peers were instructed not to initiate contact with participants after the 3-month intervention period, but they were allowed to respond to requests for contact from the participants at their own discretion<BR/>(n = 57)<BR/>
<BR/>PAGER MESSAGING: The 3-month pager intervention consisted of a customized pager system that combined the communicating abilities of the world-wide web and 2-way pagers. A computer program allowed for the timing of all text messages to be specified up front and then sent automatically without any further intervention from study staff. At randomization, the study co-ordinator distributed a 2-way pager and customized a message schedule to the participant's daily medication regimen, which was confirmed by the clinic pharmacist. In addition to dose reminders, 3 other types of text messages were sent: (1) educational; (2) entertainment (jokes or thoughts for the day); and (3) adherence assessments. There was some flexibility in the frequency and content of messages to accommodate participants' differing needs and schedules, but there was a minimum of 3 pager messages sent daily to participants for the first 2 months. Pages gradually tapered in the last month of the 3-month intervention to avoid a rebound in non-adherence. A confirmation return page was requested for every message sent. Project staff periodically reviewed the return page log and if no responses were received, the participant could be called to determine if they were having any problems with the pager. Between the first contact and the end of the 3-month intervention, the participants were asked to wear the pager at all waking moments. Participants had to use the study pagers and could not substitute with their own pager or cell phone. They were instructed not to use the devices for personal use. Participants could select from a variety of auditory alarms or a vibrate-only option if desired. If the pager was lost or failed, it was promptly replaced at no cost to the subject<BR/>(n = 56)</P>

The HAART protocol involves a series of 3 separate appointments with a pharmacist, nutritionist, and case manager after an initial meeting with a provider and before a final meeting when the provider decides whether to prescribe HAART. During these preliminary interviews, patients are given social and mental health referrals as appropriate, a daily medication schedule, and information on medication side effects and techniques to help manage them.

<P>ENHANCED INTERVENTION ARM: Patients assigned to the intervention arm could choose an alarm device, counseling or both. The alarm device was either a cell phone (if the patient so chose) or a small battery powered electronic alarm device. In either case, the project staff helped the patient set up the device of their choice. Counseling was delivered by a bachelor level nurse. In accordance with a manualized protocol, the counseling sessions involved a cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving approach to: (1) enhancing motivation for treatment continuation, (2) learning about antiretroviral medication and the prescribed regimen, (3) keeping appointments, (4) communicating with healthcare providers, (5) formulating a daily medication schedule, (6) storing medications, (7) setting reminder strategies, (8) coping with side effects, (9) securing family and social support, (10) handing adherence lapses, and (11) addressing additional barriers. Participants could also invite a treatment partner to attend the counseling sessions with them. A ''treatment partner'' was defined as someone to whom the participant had already disclosed their HIV status and who was available to assist the participant on a daily basis. Participants who opted to have counseling, either individually or with a treatment adherence partner, had 3 counseling sessions of up to 1 hour each with the study nurse. The first session occurred either at the enrollment interview or within the first 2 weeks of initiating ART; additional counseling sessions occurred at 5 and 9 weeks.

<P>PSYCHOSOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING (PSST): PSST is psychosocial skills training. It is composed of 7 treatment areas: (1) symptom management, (2) medication management, (3) social relations, (4) occupational, (5) money management, (6) couple relations, and (7) family relations. A therapist's manual describes all the areas, the skills corresponding to each area, and the training strategies for each session. The trainers were 2 psychologists who used 6 learning activities to teach patients skills acquisition: (1) introduction and explanation of the skills to be taught, including preparing and motivating patients to participate actively in the learning activities; (2) demonstration of the skills by one of the therapists, followed by a question-and-answer segment that allowed for clarification; (3) role playing: patients practiced the skills by role playing during sessions; (4) role playing feedback to allow patients to identify the resources needed to perform the skills in the real world; (5) practice of skills in their natural environment; and (6) at the beginning of the following session a segment was dedicated to verifying the practice of the skills in the community; this information was registered in a skills learning check-up list. The learning activities were similar to the 7 instructional techniques proposed for teaching social and instrumental skills to the severely mentally ill. These were modified to 6 learning activities for the participants of the present study. Patients participated in group sessions, 8 patients per group, with a time limit of 1 hour 15 minutes, once a week for a total of 48 sessions during 1 year of PSST. To verify that each treatment area was being covered systematically and adequately, a therapist fidelity evaluation form was used. Family therapy (FT) consists of 2 parts: the first was psychoeducation, which included 8 group sessions where all the patients' relatives received information about the illness, symptoms and medication management. The second part consisted of 4 sessions for each family, including the patient, oriented to problem-solving as needed by each family to improve communication skills, the recognition and management of warning signs of relapse, the importance of medication and its side effects, compliance with AP medication, and keeping appointments with physicians. 2 family therapists conducted the FT. Recreational activities for the patients, conducted by an arts teacher, included singing, musical games, creative movement, and arts and crafts, once a week for 2 hours.

<P>FULL-CAT: Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) uses manual-driven compensatory strategies and supports such as pill containers with alarms, organization of belongings, and activity checklists to prompt and sequence adaptive behaviors in an individual's home environment. CAT strategies are tailored to the specific cognitive impairments and behavioral approaches to goal-directed activity exhibited by each participant. Environmental supports in Full-CAT treatment were based upon an assessment of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions for each functional deficit were based on 2 dimensions, (1) level of impairment in executive functions and (2) whether the overt behavior of the individual during performance of goal-directed activity was characterized more by apathy, disinhibition, or a combination of these styles. According to the CAT model, individuals with poor executive functioning need high levels of structure and more obviously placed environmental cues, while those with somewhat better executive functioning need less structure and more subtle cues. Individuals with apathetic behavior benefit from environmental supports that cue and sequence behavior, those with disinhibition benefit most from the removal of distracting stimuli, and those with mixed behavior benefit from a combination of these strategies. Assessment results yield one of 6 CAT classifications for which interventions can be targeted. Once an individual's CAT classification was determined, strategies for specific functional problems were chosen from the manual. CAT interventions were established, trained, and maintained in the home during weekly visits from a CAT therapist/trainer. Patients in Full-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. The treatment lasted for 9 months and then the patients were followed up for 6 months after the withdrawal of home visits. CAT therapists were individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees in psychology or related fields trained using a combination of didactic and in vivo strategies.<BR/>(n = 37)<BR/>

Additional issues such as transportation are addressed only if they relate to taking medication or making it to clinic appointments. Patients in Full-CAT and Pharm-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. Visits in Pharm-CAT were necessarily shorter in duration because the focus of treatment was circumscribed around the issue of adherence.

<P>AROUND-THE-CLOCK INTERVENTION: The intervention was alarms to remind administering analgesic 4 hours after going to bed on the night of surgery and next 2 postoperative nights as instructed by the research nurse. In addition to the study procedure, all children and families received discharge education from their ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician/clinic and from the professional nurses in each of the ambulatory centers. Discharge education in both ambulatory settings included use of around-the-clock prescribed analgesia for pain during the early days of recovery; increased fluid intake; monitoring for infection and bleeding; and returning to their specialist at a designated time in the recovery process. In addition, all ENT specialists encouraged families to contact them with concerns.

<P>SHARED DECISION-MAKING : Session 1 involved setting the stage, gathering patient information, providing information and negotiating a treatment plan. In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was negotiated, patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. The SDM model implemented the 4 key defining features. The care manager elicited the patient's goals for treatment and relative priorities regarding symptom control, regimen convenience, avoidance of side effects, and cost. The patient was then shown a list of the full range of regimen options for all levels of asthma severity, based on the then-current national asthma guidelines and KP pharmacopeia. These options differed with respect to the number and type(s) of medications, dosing, and schedule. Using a simple worksheet, the patient and clinician then compared the pros and cons of all of the options the patient wished to consider, which included the option of continuing the patient's current regimen to arrive at a treatment that best accommodated the patient's and care manager's goals. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was negotiated<BR/>(n = 204)<BR/>
<BR/>CLINICIAN DECISION-MAKING: Session 1 of the intervention involved prescribing the patient a therapy rather than negotiating a therapy. In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was decided (CDM), patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. In the CDM model, the care manager prescribed an appropriate regimen based on the patient's level of asthma control, and explained that decision to the patient.

<P>USUAL CARE: Usual asthma care at KP medical centers was based on a stepped-care approach to pharmacotherapy with the aim of long-term asthma control, as recommended by the National Asthma Education Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 2. At some KP sites, physicians also had the option to refer patients to an asthma care management program, typically of less than 6 months' duration, in which a licensed health professional (non-physician) provided asthma education and addressed adherence and other medication use and self management issues in a manner similar to, but less structured than, the CDM intervention. However, asthma care management was neither a required aspect of usual care nor necessarily available at all BOAT sites, and current participation in that program was an exclusion criterion for the study. Once enrolled in BOAT, usual care and SDM or CDM patients (after the intervention phase) still had access to KP's existing care management services, if available, based on their physician's referral<BR/>(n = 204)<BR/>

<P>INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (IH) COACHING: 2 coaches provided the coaching intervention. Both had substantial training in coaching methods as well as masters-level degrees in social work or psychology. Coaches each had over 100 hours of experience of individualized coaching with type 2 diabetes patients and had previously facilitated diabetes coaching groups. Participants randomized to the coaching condition had an initial telephone session with their coach within 2 weeks of the baseline visit. They were then offered 30-minute coaching sessions by telephone (8 weekly calls, 4 biweekly calls, and a final call 1 month later) for a total of 14 sessions. Participants were paired with the same coach throughout the intervention. During the initial telephone call, participants were asked what was important to them in terms of diabetes care, how well they were managing their health, and what they perceived to be their challenges or areas of required support. Patients were guided in creating a vision of health, and long-term goals were discussed that aligned with that vision. To facilitate learning, participants randomized to IH coaching received a binder of educational materials at the initial assessment visit. Contents included materials from GlaxoSmithKline's Adherence Starts with Knowledge (ASK-20) and Essential Connections as well as information from Duke Integrative Medicine. These were referenced throughout the interactions of the study. The ASK-20 is a brief survey that helps practitioners quickly identify and target reasons patients may not be adhering to prescribed medication regimens. It is accompanied by materials on topics relevant to self management such as symptom recognition, self care, and disease risk factors. Duke Integrative Medicine provided information regarding nutrition, stress management, and tips on how to best utilize time with the coach. Additional materials came from Essential Connections, a resource of tools for coaches to facilitate motivational interviewing techniques and behavior change, linking topics of interest with patients' readiness to change and relevant education content<BR/>(n = 30)<BR/>
