<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Does body positioning affect cardiorespiratory parameters in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with clinically significant apnoea?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Apnoea is a condition in which an infant stops breathing for a short duration but then resumes normal breathing. Apnoea is rare among infants born at term, but its incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. Apnoea is generally considered a normal occurrence in the healthy preterm infant. However, long-term consequences of recurrent apnoea that lead to lower oxygen levels in sick preterm infants remain unknown. In addition, little agreement has been reached about what degree of apnoea is acceptable. It has been proposed that body positioning is an easy, practical and effective intervention as compared with other, invasive measures for minimising or preventing apnoea. Therefore, this review was conducted to see if different body positions can prevent or alleviate apnoea.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>Review authors searched the medical literature and identified five eligible trials that recruited a total of 114 infants. Our updated search (November 2016) identified no new studies for inclusion in this review. Included studies examined effects on cardiorespiratory parameters of supine versus prone; prone versus right lateral; prone versus left lateral; right lateral versus left lateral; prone horizontal versus prone head elevated; right lateral horizontal versus right lateral head elevated; and left lateral horizontal versus left lateral head elevated positions in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with apnoea.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>None of the individual included studies nor meta-analyses showed differences on cardiorespiratory parameters between different preterm infant body positions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence: </B>The overall quality of evidence was low to very low because of high or unclear risk of bias and imprecise results yielded by small sample sizes. Thus, this review cannot recommend use of one body position over another for spontaneously breathing preterm infants with apnoea.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-06 10:21:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-06 10:03:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apnoea of prematurity (AOP) is defined as a pause in breathing lasting at least 20 seconds on its own, or at least 10 seconds with concomitant bradycardia and/or hypoxaemia, that occurs in preterm infants (gestational age &lt; 37 weeks) (<LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2011</LINK>). AOP reflects immaturity of the brainstem and peripheral chemoreceptors that results in an abnormal ventilatory response to high carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) and low oxygen (hypoxia), along with immature reflex responses (<LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2011</LINK>). Apnoea can be classified as central, obstructive or mixed in type. Central apnoea has its origins in the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterised by absence of a respiratory effort. Obstructive apnoea, which is less common than central apnoea, is usually encountered only in infants with upper airway abnormalities (such as floppy tissue obstructing the airway) or in infants with rare brainstem anomalies such as Dandy-Walker malformations (<LINK REF="REF-Eichenwald-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichenwald 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janvier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janvier 2004</LINK>). Moreover, improper neck positioning, especially flexion, can cause airway obstruction in preterm infants that mimics obstructive apnoea. Mixed apnoea, the most common type among preterm infants, comprises components of both central apnoea and obstructive apnoea. Usually, mixed apnoeic episodes start as central apnoea that subsequently results in a decrease in upper airway tone, leading to obstruction and thus an obstructive apnoea-like mechanism that persists even when respiratory effort is resumed (<LINK REF="REF-Eichenwald-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichenwald 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of AOP increases with decreasing gestational age and lower birth weight, and the condition affects 90% of infants born before 28 weeks of gestation or with birth weight less than 1000 grams. AOP is distinct from apnoea as witnessed in term infants. Term infants with apnoea are more likely to have a serious underlying condition that may account for their apnoea, such as infection, a neurological anomaly or a metabolic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2016</LINK>). Hypoxia associated with apnoea could have detrimental effects on the infant&#8217;s developing tissues and organs, resulting in long-term or permanent impairment, such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), impaired growth, cardiorespiratory instability and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Fiore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Fiore 2010</LINK>). Risk of hypoxaemic episodes is increased when peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<SUB>2</SUB>) decreases to &#8804; 80% or 85% for longer than 10 seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Janvier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janvier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Managing AOP, determining optimal levels and durations of various therapies, and determining readiness of affected infants for discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) continue to present major challenges, and accurate quantitation of apnoea is required for both appropriate clinical care and outcomes research (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2016</LINK>). If an infant with AOP does not respond to tactile stimulation, interventions such as positioning, stochastic resonance, respiratory stimulants, oxygen therapy or ventilation may become necessary. However, treatment should start with efforts to identify and correct known conditions that can increase the likelihood of AOP such as hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, metabolic alkalosis, anaemia, arterial hypotension and any condition that increases the workload of breathing. Medications that depress CNS activity also favour apnoea and should be avoided if possible.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Positioning</HEADING>
<P>We found conflicting statements in the literature regarding which position is most appropriate for low birth weight (LBW) preterm infants. US national guidelines for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) recommend the supine position for preterm infants who are ready to be discharged (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blair-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2006</LINK>). However, the preferred practice of neonatal nurses has long been to place preterm infants in the prone position when providing care to reduce stress (<LINK REF="REF-Ghorbani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghorbani 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Candia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candia 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2014</LINK>), increase oxygenation and decrease episodes of desaturation (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stochastic resonance</HEADING>
<P>A few studies have found that mechanosensory stimulation, also known as 'stochastic resonance', delivered through filtered low-amplitude white noise provided by actuators embedded within the infant's mattress, led to a decrease in the number, duration and intensity of oxygen desaturation events (<LINK REF="REF-Bloch_x002d_Salisbury-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloch-Salisbury 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2015</LINK>), probably caused by improved breathing and attenuated inhibitory reflexes attained by stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Waggener-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waggener 1982</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Respiratory stimulants</HEADING>
<P>When apnoeic episodes are severe and persistent, respiratory stimulants, namely, xanthines, such as caffeine, theophylline and aminophylline, can be used. Xanthines act centrally to cause brainstem stimulation, leading to an increased respiratory drive, enhanced sensitivity to hypercarbia and reduced tolerance to hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2016</LINK>). Although these respiratory stimulants are similarly effective in alleviating apnoeic episodes, caffeine has become the standard of care in most developed countries, simply because it can be administered orally, has a longer half-life and a broader therapeutic range and is associated with a lower incidence of serious complications when compared with its counterparts.</P>
<P>Moreover, monitoring of serum concentrations as required for theophylline is not needed when caffeine is given, making its use easier and more practical for the NICU setting. However, it is worth noting that administration of methylxanthines such as caffeine may lead to short-term complications such as irritability, feed intolerance, gastric irritation and tachycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2010</LINK>). Other stimulants such as doxapram and ampakines have been tested recently but have not yet been adopted into standard practice (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2016</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-16 00:33:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whether non-prone body positions can compromise the physiological stability of spontaneously breathing preterm infants with recurrent apnoea is an important clinical question for NICU caregivers. Thus, the authors of this review set out to review all available evidence on effects of non-prone versus prone body positions on the incidence of AOP. Preterm infants are usually cared for in the supine, prone, left lateral or right lateral position, with limited changes in position, to reduce stress and allow them to sleep between nursing care procedures. However, prolonged positioning of the infant in any of these positions increases the risk of pressure ulcers, and repositioning of infants every two to four hours is encouraged (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Burg-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Burg 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although several studies have reported that prone positioning rather than supine positioning improves oxygenation and lung function by optimising breathing strategy, researchers have argued more recently that oxygenation is not affected by positioning but instead follows an anatomical rather than a gravitational pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Gouna-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gouna 2013</LINK>). Moreover, studies on the effect of lateral positioning on oxygenation show conflicting results, with some reporting improvement and others describing no change in oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Brunherotti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunherotti 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gouna-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gouna 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Burg-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Burg 2016</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-06 10:21:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that prone positioning improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony and can stabilise the chest wall without affecting an infant's breathing pattern or oxygen saturation. Several studies have reported that prone positioning reduces AOP (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2006</LINK>), but for reducing the incidence of hypoxaemia and bradycardia among preterm infants, proponents of both prone and supine positions can be found (Heimann 2010; <LINK REF="REF-Bauschatz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauschatz 2008</LINK>). Additionally, researchers have found that tilting the head of a preterm infant in prone position at a 15- to 45-degree angle increases end-expiratory lung volume, improves oxygenation and decreases respiratory and heart rates (<LINK REF="STD-Jenni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenni 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dellagrammaticas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dellagrammaticas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1988</LINK>), possibly as the result of decreased diaphragmatic fatigue, improved ventilation in lower segments of the lungs and enhanced ventilation/perfusion matching (<LINK REF="STD-Dellagrammaticas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dellagrammaticas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1988</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-16 00:36:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Body positioning is a non-invasive procedure that, when skilfully implemented, can provide comfort and containment while facilitating the interaction between infant and parents (<LINK REF="REF-Candia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candia 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2014</LINK>). If it is found that body positioning can reduce clinically significant apnoea in the preterm infant, use of more invasive measures to alleviate apnoea may be reduced or avoided altogether, leading to optimal management of apnoea in preterm infants.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review comparing effects of different body positioning on 581 hospitalised infants and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) found that the prone position was significantly superior to the supine position in terms of enhancing oxygenation. However, most participants in this study were ventilated preterm infants (i.e. not spontaneously breathing), leading review authors to conclude that the benefits of prone positioning may be most relevant to this specific subgroup of preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2012</LINK>). Likewise, a Cochrane review addressing effects of body positioning in 285 newborns receiving mechanical ventilation reported that the prone position slightly improved oxygenation in neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation but found no evidence of sustained improvement in clinically relevant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, to further inform NICU caregivers and to contribute to the quality of current neonatal clinical care practices, authors of the current review sought to update included evidence to ascertain whether use of any specific body position over another results in benefit or harm for spontaneously breathing preterm infants with apnoea. This review is an update of a previous systematic review that assessed effects of positioning on cardiorespiratory functions of spontaneously breathing preterm infants with apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Bredemeyer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bredemeyer 2012</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK> was the only study that reported outcomes for severe apnoea (i.e. mixed events), which was defined as cessation of breathing <U>and</U> a fall in heart rate to greater than 30% below baseline <U>and</U> a concurrent fall in oxygen saturation to less than 85%.</P>
<P>Studies addressing bradycardia used different definitions for this term. <LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK> defined severe bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to greater than 30% below baseline associated with a significant fall in oxygen saturation greater than 10% and an alteration in respiratory pattern suggesting decreased respiratory efforts. <LINK REF="STD-Heimler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heimler 1992</LINK> defined bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute lasting five seconds or longer. <LINK REF="STD-Jenni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenni 1997</LINK> defined bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to less than 90 beats per minute. <LINK REF="STD-Keene-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 2000</LINK> defined bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute, classified as mild (drop to reach 90 to 99 beats per minute) or clinically significant (drop to &lt; 90 beats per minute). We used data from the latter definition in our meta-analysis. All studies determined bradycardia by counting the number of bradycardia events that occurred in each body position.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenni 1997</LINK>) measured severe bradycardia but used slightly different definitions; <LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK> defined severe bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to greater than 30% below baseline for 10 seconds or longer <U>and</U> a concurrent fall in oxygen saturation to less than 85%. <LINK REF="STD-Jenni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenni 1997</LINK> defined severe bradycardia as a fall in heart rate to less than 90 beats per minute <U>and</U> a concurrent decrease in oxygen saturation to less than 80%.</P>
<P>Moreover, three of the studies included in the review measured 'episodes of oxygen desaturation'. <LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK> defined oxygen desaturation as the number of episodes during which oxygen saturation fell to less than 85% for longer than 10 seconds without occurrence of an apnoea or bradycardia event. <LINK REF="STD-Keene-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 2000</LINK> defined oxygen desaturation as the number of episodes during which oxygen saturation fell to less than 90% and classified its severity as mild (drop to reach 80% to 90%) or clinically significant (drop to less than 80%). For our meta-analysis, we used data reported for the drop in oxygen saturation to less than 80% for the latter trial. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Jenni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenni 1997</LINK> defined oxygen desaturation as the number of episodes during which oxygen saturation fell to less than 80%.</P>

<P>Overall, we found evidence of low to very low quality for all of the major outcomes of this review. The factors that most affected the quality of evidence were high or unclear risk of allocation concealment and imprecision (broad confidence interval), high or unclear risk of performance bias, high or unclear risk of detection bias and reliance upon a single study (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>). In addition, use of a cross-over design prevented measurement of effects on late outcomes (e.g. long-term neurodevelopment). Moreover, the order in which treatments were administered may have affected the outcome, except in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK>, in which investigators introduced an additional period to account for this. Furthermore, a "carry-over" effect from one position to another may have occurred because of the absence of an adequate "wash-out" period between treatments in all but two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredemeyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredemeyer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heimler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heimler 1992</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-16 01:03:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We concluded that evidence is insufficient to show effects of body positioning on apnoea, bradycardia and oxygen saturation in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with clinically significant apnoea. Although the prone position seems to benefit ventilated preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2012</LINK>), the same cannot be said about the prone position in spontaneously breathing (i.e. non-ventilated) preterm infants. In addition, as a result of the association of the prone position with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blair-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2006</LINK>), all hospitalised infants placed in the prone position must undergo continuous monitoring of cardiorespiratory and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<SUB>2</SUB>).</P>
<P>None of the trials included in our review reported complications or adverse effects related to the use of supine, prone or lateral body positions. This presents limitations in making conclusions and potential recommendations for clinical practice. Moreover, in all of the included studies, researchers placed infants in each body position only for a short duration (three to 12 hours). Therefore, they were unable to assess any long-term effects associated with prolonged placement of an infant in any of these positions, such as flattened posture, high extensor tone or altered head shape.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-16 01:04:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The fact that no new studies have been conducted in the past four years on this topic may indicate that body positioning could have little or no effect on cardiorespiratory parameters of spontaneously breathing preterm infants. However, this statement remains to be tested by future evidence. Evidence is insufficient to show effects of body positioning on cardiorespiratory parameters of preterm infants. The benefit or harm of one body position over another cannot be ensured because trials have been few, have included only a small number of participants and have exhibited weakness in their corresponding designs.</P>
<P>Therefore, large, international, multi-centre, randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to better assess effects of positioning on cardiorespiratory parameters of spontaneously breathing preterm infants with recurrent apnoea. Researchers should also collect clinically meaningful data on mortality, morbidity, recovery variables and adverse effects associated with allocated positions and should seek to determine the optimal frequency and timing of different positions for providing maximal sustained benefit for the infant&#8217;s well-being and development. Further research into the effectiveness of other body positions may also be needed.</P>

<P>Infants were initially allocated to 1 of 6 body positions - prone 1, prone 2, right lateral 1, right lateral 2, left lateral 1 and left lateral 2 - via assignment of a sequence number from 1 to 6, respectively, via a Latin square.</P>
<P>Body position was changed every 4 hours over a period of 24 hours, with each infant acting as his/her own control and going through all 6 positions.</P>
<P>When an infant was in any of the positions '1', he/she was placed in a horizontal or flat position. When the infant was rotated to any of the positions '2', he/she was placed in an elevated position on the mattress at a 15 degree elevation angle.</P>
<P>An added seventh period of monitoring lasting for 4 hours at the end of each of the 6 sequences accounted for the remaining 4 hours of the 28-hour monitoring period. Infants went through this 4-hour period to reveal adverse effects that may have been associated with movement of the infant from the last position in the sequence to the next one in the sequence, just to show that the sequence of body positions makes no difference with regards to the outcomes of interest (Hypothesis 9).</P>
<P>Instrument(s) of measurement included:</P>
<P>&#8226; a neonatal cardiorespiratory monitor (Neo-Trak 502 Infant Monitor; Corometrics Medical Systems Inc., Wallingford, Connecticut, USA), used to record respiratory effort (apnoeic events) and heart rate (bradycardiac events); and</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>"Of the 45 infants who entered the study there were 9 infants whose data were incomplete due to 'computer downloads that were not correctly saved, and were unable to be recovered' by the investigator for analysis. Each of these 9 infants had one position (four hours) of lost data resulting in missing values sufficient to confound the multivariate analyses". "These 9 infants were removed to 'ensure consistency in the characteristics and number of subjects throughout all phases of the analyses". This left a cohort of 36 infants, who completed the study protocol with complete data sets provided for all.</P>

<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged the study to be at low risk of bias if it was blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes and classes of outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; or</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs and protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome or class of outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (less than 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>inadequate; or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (when it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study did not include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. early termination of trial due to data-dependant process, extreme baseline imbalance). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. We assessed other sources of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made judgements as to whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to overall risk of bias, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias, and whether we considered it likely to have an impact on the findings.</P>
