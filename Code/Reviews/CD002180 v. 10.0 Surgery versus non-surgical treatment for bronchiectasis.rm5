<P>Removal of affected parts of the lung is often carried out in patients with bronchiectasis. A review was performed with the aim of identifying evidence for the benefit of surgery in bronchiectasis.

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-26 15:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is defined as the chronic dilatation of one or more bronchi. The first clinico-pathological description of the condition was given by Laennec in 1819. The disease is typically caused by a childhood pneumonia which irreparably damages the developing lung. Other causes include tuberculous infection, cystic fibrosis and immunoglobulin deficiencies. In the most severe cases the disease leads to recurrent infection, chronic bronchial sepsis and progressive lung damage culminating in ventilatory failure. Life-threatening complications including massive haemoptysis are occasionally seen. There is however considerable heterogeneity in the presentation and severity of the disease. The incidence of bronchiectasis in developed countries has fallen since the advent of effective anti-tuberculous chemotherapy, broad spectrum antibiotics and vaccination for childhood infections such as measles and whooping cough. Nevertheless a small but significant population of patients exist who encounter problems due to bronchiectasis. It has been a widely held view that if the area of the lung affected by bronchiectatic change is localised and the patient's symptoms are debilitating, surgical resection of the affected region may be of benefit. Non-randomised case-control studies and large series have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Annest-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annest 1982b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ashour-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashour 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dogan-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dogan 1989b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-George-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1979b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-1974b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 1974b</LINK>). The results are of uncertain value, however, mainly because patients in the surgically treated groups tended to have less severe disease. This review aims to identify randomised, controlled studies that compared surgical intervention with conventional non surgical ("conservative") treatment for chronic (non-cystic fibrosis) bronchiectasis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to determine whether surgical resection of areas of lung affected by bronchiectasis is a superior form of treatment to conventional conservative therapy (usually consisting of postural drainage and various regimes of antibiotic administration). We excluded bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis from this study.</P>

<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details). All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'bronchiectasis' were searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>surg* OR resec* OR lobect* OR pneumonect* OR segmentec*</P>
<P>An additional search of CENTRAL was also completed using the same search strategy. The most recent searches were carried out in May 2011.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Surgical intervention in patients with localised areas of bronchiectasis is a widespread practice. We have not identified any randomised controlled trials which address this issue. In mitigation this is a difficult area to study prospectively. There are case series and non-randomised case-controlled reports (<LINK REF="REF-Annest-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annest 1982b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ashour-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashour 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dogan-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dogan 1989b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-George-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1979b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-1974b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 1974b</LINK>), but such studies were largely in patients with less severe disease. One large retrospective study in 166 participants with purulent sputum reported improvements in symptoms at long-term follow-up, and mortality and morbidity rates of 1.7 and 11% following surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Kutlay-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kutlay 2002</LINK>). However, the absence of randomisation in all of these studies makes them liable to bias in selection. </P>
<P>This review should be regarded as concluding that, in the absence of randomised control trials, there is no unbiased evidence of the effect of surgery for bronchiectasis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review should be regarded as concluding that, in the absence of randomised control trials, there is no unbiased evidence of the effect of surgery for bronchiectasis. Equally, it does not provide evidence that surgery is of no benefit.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of a surgical intervention in patients with confirmed bronchiectasis are required to establish any benefit of surgical intervention compared with standard conservative therapy in bronchiectasis. In addition to the impact of surgery on symptoms, adequate assessment should be made of the safety of surgery in these participants. </P>
