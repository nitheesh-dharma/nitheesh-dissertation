<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-09 18:08:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Myasthenia gravis is caused by the body's antibodies impairing transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, resulting in fluctuating weakness and fatigue. Acute attacks can be life threatening because of swallowing or breathing difficulties. Seven randomised controlled trials which included in all 199 participants are published. None fulfilled the presently accepted standards of a high-quality trial. All these studies have risks of bias and have a weak statistical power. Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that corticosteroids offer short-term benefit compared with placebo (dummy treatment). This supports the conclusions of observational studies and expert opinion. Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show any difference in efficacy between corticosteroids and either azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin. All trials had design flaws which limit the strength of the conclusions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed.</P>

<P>Seven trials involving a total of 199 participants were included. A trial of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (43 participants) did not show any advantage compared with placebo for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis. Two double-blind trials compared prednisone with placebo for generalised myasthenia gravis. In the first (13 participants), the improvement was slightly greater in the prednisone group at six months. In the second (20 participants) which was a short-term trial, the improvement was significantly greater at two weeks. Two trials compared glucocorticosteroids with azathioprine (41 and 10 participants respectively). In one of these the rate of treatment failure was greater in the prednisone group. In a trial of glucocorticosteroids versus intravenous immunoglobulin (33 participants) no differences in treatment responses were encountered during a treatment period of 14 days. An open trial (39 participants) evaluating different corticosteroid doses revealed a shorter time to improvement in the high-dose group. None fulfilled the presently accepted standards of a high-quality trial. All these studies have risks of bias and have a weak statistical power.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-09 18:32:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-09 18:32:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies reduce the number of available acetylcholine receptors and thereby impair neuromuscular transmission. The annual incidence of MG is between 0.25 and 2.00 per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2003</LINK>). The cardinal features of MG are weakness and fatigability of skeletal and extraocular muscles. In more than half of cases the initial symptoms are ptosis and diplopia, often followed by involvement of bulbopharyngeal and skeletal muscles. The natural history of MG is characterised by exacerbations and more or less complete remissions. Respiratory and swallowing difficulties during myasthenic crisis are life-threatening and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. In 382 patients whose disease began between 1940 and 1960, Grob (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1981</LINK>) reported death in 33%, remission in 11% and improvement in 20%. Recently, the death rate was reported to be less than 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1997</LINK>). Oosterhuis reported remission in 38% and improvement in 25% of 537 patients followed between 1960 and 1994 with changing treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>). Treatments tried include oral and intravenous glucocorticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 2003</LINK>) and most recently mycophenolate mofetil (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ciafaloni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciafaloni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale for using corticosteroids is the autoimmune nature of the disease and the beneficial effects of this group of drugs in other autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of action of corticosteroids in MG are poorly understood. Effects on the activation of helper T cells and the proliferation of B cells, activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells are considered to play a role (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1995</LINK>). A beneficial effect of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was first observed by Simon in 1935 (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1935</LINK>) and later when it was given with the aim of 'shrinking thymoma' (<LINK REF="REF-Soffler-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soffler 1948</LINK>). In the early years exacerbation of myasthenic symptoms and a lethal outcome due to respiratory and swallowing difficulties were observed during the onset of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-von-Reis-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Reis 1966</LINK>). In a co-operative study some 300 courses of ACTH were given to 100 patients, and 'good improvement' was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Genkins-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genkins 1971</LINK>). High-dose alternate-day administration of prednisone was also reported to have a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Warmolts-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warmolts 1971</LINK>). Brunner et al. reported on nine patients treated with multiple short courses of intramuscular methylprednisolone in doses of 60 mg daily (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 1972</LINK>). To overcome the problem of initial worsening of MG, as reported with oral doses of 60 to 100 mg, Seybold and Drachman developed a safer regime with gradually increasing doses (<LINK REF="REF-Seybold-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seybold 1974</LINK>). In this open-label trial the best results were achieved with courses of combined therapy including intramuscular or intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, with improvement being maintained for up to four months. A gradually increasing therapeutic effect of prednisone started after a few days but was usually obvious after two weeks or exceptionally after four to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Sghirlanzoni-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sghirlanzoni 1984</LINK>). Initial exacerbation may occur despite slowly increasing alternate day schedules (<LINK REF="REF-Sghirlanzoni-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sghirlanzoni 1984</LINK>). In the last 20 years several retrospective studies have reported very good efficacy of prednisone used with different dosages. A rate of 80.2% good results (remission or marked improvement) and 27.6 % remission in a series of 116 generalised MG patients was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Pascuzzi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascuzzi 1984</LINK>). In other case series these figures were respectively 71.6% and 41.6% (n = 60) (<LINK REF="REF-Sghirlanzoni-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sghirlanzoni 1984</LINK>), 63.4% and 33.8% (n = 142) (<LINK REF="REF-Cosi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosi 1991</LINK>) and 81.7% and 39.4% (n = 104) (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1992</LINK>). Numerous side effects of varying severity were reported in all series including: osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, infection, gastric ulcer, glaucoma and others. In the four series cited above at least one side effect was observed in 52.2% of the patients. Short courses of large intravenous doses were employed to manage exacerbations with good results (<LINK REF="REF-Arsura-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arsura 1985</LINK>). Serious complications were not reported in this study, but another study reported a severe myopathy following high dose pulses of systemic glucocorticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Panegyres-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panegyres 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One randomised trial of ACTH versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>), two randomised trials of prednisone versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) and two randomised trials of prednisone versus azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) were known to the authors when this review was started. We also included an interim analysis of a randomised controlled trial of oral prednisone versus high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>) which underwent early termination. An open Chinese trial on the effects of treatment with high and low-dose corticosteroids in juvenile MG was also included (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>). No new studies were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates of the review, including the current one (2011).</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years the outcome of MG has improved dramatically. With the introduction of mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents and therapeutic plasma exchange, mortality has dropped to less than 10%. However, due to these therapeutic options the percentage of patients with a chronic and severe course of the disease is likely to have increased, but no exact figures are available. If in earlier decades the most severe patients tended to die during myasthenic crisis, the survivors would not reflect the same spectrum of the disease as the patients encountered more recently. This may introduce bias, when comparing treatment trials over the last 30 years, which is difficult to quantify.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews dealing with the treatment of myasthenia gravis have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Benatar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benatar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gajdos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gajdos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gajdos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gajdos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehndiratta-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehndiratta 2011</LINK>). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and previously updated in 2006 and 2007.</P>

<P>Two authors (CS and PG) independently assessed risk of bias and decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded their methodological quality. The assessment of methodological quality of the trials included sequence generation, allocation concealment, binding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias, as described in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Other sources of bias included sample size and statistical power, explicit diagnostic criteria, explicit outcome criteria, exactness of the description of clinical status, how studies dealt with baseline differences of the experimental groups, and completeness of follow-up. We judged the risk of bias for each entry as low, high or unclear. If agreement had been poor we would have reassessed the studies and reached agreement by consensus.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-04-04 17:00:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Philippe Gajdos">
<P>We analysed all the primary and secondary outcomes under consideration whenever the data allowed. We resolved disagreements about inclusion by discussion between the review authors.</P>
<P>We tried to perform a plausible transformation of the scoring system of each study into a simple two-step (improved or not improved/worsened), or if possible into a four-step (marked improvement, mild improvement, no changes, worsening) categorised system. These categories were extracted from the individual papers by approximation of relevant information whenever possible. For improvement categories we used the Osserman classification (<LINK REF="REF-Osserman-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osserman 1971</LINK>) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and the quantitative Besinger and Toyka scale (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Besinger and Toyka scale<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1983</LINK>, modified in <LINK REF="REF-Tindall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tindall 1987</LINK>) has eight test items (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). For each item four grades (0 (normal) and 1, 2, 3 (worst)) are given. For calculation, grades of each item are added and divided by the number of items tested (maximum 8, minimum 3). Participants are tested under optimal anticholinesterase medication one to three hours after the last medication. On serial testing, slight alterations of the MG score (within 0.3 score grades, i.e. 0.15 grades up or down) are considered as no definite change; 0.3 to 1.0 as moderate change; and more than 1.0 as marked change (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>For example, change from Osserman type IIb to type I would be considered as marked improvement whereas a change from Osserman type IIb to IIa would indicate only moderate improvement. Marked improvement of single items of the quantitative Besinger and Toyka scale would be, for example, an increase of the maximal arm outstretched time from 10 to 60 seconds; whereas an increase of arm outstretched time from 80 to 120 seconds would indicate only mild improvement. This way of data transformation from a categorical or non-categorical system to a simplified system would allow an approximate comparison of degrees of improvement in different studies. In simple terms, a meaningful change would be a change in weakness that falls outside normal daily or day-to-day fluctuations.</P>
<P>Apart from these categorised primary endpoints we compared the data of those studies in which identical or very similar primary or secondary outcome measures have been used. We wanted to define sensitivity measures for each study (e.g. pyridostigmine dose, number of intravenous corticosteroid pulses, dose of oral corticosteroids). We wanted to evaluate whether these measures supported the primary and secondary outcome measures, or not.</P>

<P>The search revealed ten possible randomised trials, of which seven were suitable for inclusion. We excluded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Horstkotte-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Horstkotte 1992</LINK>) which only dealt with glucocorticosteroids therapy in MG as part of a larger group of autoimmune disorders and with the application of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrates in plasma exchange. A trial comparing ciclosporin with placebo was also excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). We excluded a randomised trial of oral prednisone with and without combined plasma exchanges (PE) and cyclophosphamide in the case of failure of oral prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1983</LINK>) because the design of this study did not allow separation of the effects of glucocorticosteroids from the effects of cyclophosphamide and/or plasma exchanges. Advertisement among colleagues did not identify unpublished trials. A Chinese trial on high-dose and low-dose prednisone treatment in juvenile MG was evaluated on the basis of an English translation of the relevant parts of the publication.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of ACTH versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Mount (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>) compared the efficacy of ACTH (total dose 580 units for eight days, 21 participants) versus placebo (22 participants) for ocular myasthenia. Patients were included if they had pure ocular myasthenia. The trial was double-blind. The endpoints were eye movements measured with a camera at two weeks and at intervals of one, three, six and 12 months. There was no evidence that ACTH was any more effective in producing improvement than placebo up to three months so the examinations at six and 12 months were not made.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of corticosteroids versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Howard et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>) compared the efficacy of prednisone (100 mg on alternate days, six participants) versus placebo (seven participants) in a placebo-controlled double-blind and in part, single cross-over study. Inclusion criteria were 'a moderately severe myasthenia gravis' with a 'widespread defect of neuromuscular transmission' on electrophysiological studies and a positive edrophonium test. Muscle strength was tested with ergograms at rest and with sustained posture. Endpoints were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>improvement at six months defined as improvement of at least two grades in the weakest muscles. The grading system ranged from 0 to -4. In this system 0 was normal strength and -4 was marked weakness.</LI>
<LI>reduction in the amount of anticholinesterase medication by at least one third of the dose.</LI>
<LI>ability to function normally in routine daily life activities except for residual ocular symptoms.</LI>
<LI>remission defined as (a) no weakness, (b) no anticholinesterase medication, (c) no restriction of activities.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The trial authors did not differentiate between primary and secondary outcome criteria. Three-month data were not provided.</P>
<P>At six months, three out of six participants receiving prednisone and three out of seven participants receiving placebo improved. Anticholinesterase medication was reduced by at least one third of the dose in two out of six participants in the prednisone group and in one out of seven participants in the placebo group. No participant entered remission in either treatment group. Although improvement had been defined as increase in strength of at least two grades in the weakest muscle, ability to function normally in routine daily life except for ocular symptoms and reduction in the amount of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, detailed information on the clinical status at six months was lacking.</P>
<P>After six months prednisone was stopped for the three participants who did not improve while taking prednisone and prednisone was started for the four participants who did not improve while taking placebo. Three of these four participants improved, one was unchanged. After two years, seven of the 13 participants were still on prednisone: four had 'excellent' improvement at a dose above 20 mg, three had a relapse at a dose of 15 to 25 mg prednisone, two of the three improved at an increased dose of 70 mg, and in one of the three the outcome was not clear since he was 'currently hospitalised to increase prednisone'.</P>
<P>Lindberg et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) conducted a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study in people with generalised MG, comparing methylprednisolone 2 g intravenously on two consecutive days (10 participants) versus placebo (10 participants). Study duration was 14 weeks. Participants were examined two weeks before the beginning of treatment, at the initiation of treatment, two weeks after treatment and every two weeks up to 14 weeks.</P>
<P>The primary endpoint was a significant change in muscle function at two weeks after treatment: a difference of more than 20 in a test for muscle weakness and fatigue which was based on the analysis of the biological variability of the score at two examinations performed the same day. A positive treatment response after two weeks was considered present if (a) a significant increase in function between zero weeks and two weeks had occurred or (b) function was stabilised between zero weeks and two weeks followed by a deterioration between two weeks before therapy and at the beginning of therapy (week zero). The secondary endpoint was change in AChR antibody titre. The test for muscle weakness and fatigue included the following items: counting loudly (up to 100 times), holding arms forward while sitting (up to 100 seconds), leg crossing while sitting (up to 20 times), maximal forced jaw occlusions (up to 100 times), holding legs lifted at 45° in a supine position for 15 seconds, fixed upward gaze at an angle of 45 ° (up to 100 seconds), alternating hand grasp and finger extension (100 times), alternating squat and stand at an angle of 90° in the knee (up to 20 times).<BR/>The secondary endpoint was the change in AChR antibody titre.</P>
<P>At two weeks, a mean increase in muscle function of 27 points was found in the treatment group compared with only a 0.7 point increase in the placebo group (P value = 0.006).</P>
<P>In the corticosteroid group six participants had marked improvement and two had mild improvement. In the placebo group one participant had markedly improved. The duration of improvement in the six markedly improved participants in the methylprednisolone group ranged from four to 14 weeks. The relative rate of improvement was 7.2 times greater (95% CI 1.11 to 46.89) in the treatment group than the placebo group, indicating significant short-term benefit from corticosteroids.</P>
<P>No change in serum concentration of AChR antibodies was found after treatment in either of the two groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of corticosteroids at different doses</HEADING>
<P>Zhang (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) compared two different types of glucocorticosteroids in juvenile MG. They compared a 'high dose' intravenous (IV) regimen of methylprednisolone with daily 'lower dose' oral prednisone in a randomised controlled open trial. The study duration was 14 weeks. Thirty-nine participants with juvenile MG (ocular, bulbar or generalised) were included. Nineteen participants received high-dose IV methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg/day for three days and the alternate dose of 2 mg/kg until the second month and then progressively reduced to 1 mg every other day by the fifth month). Twenty participants were treated with lower-dose oral prednisone (1 mg/kg once daily for one month reduced gradually to 0.5 mg/kg daily by the fifth month and then progressively reduced to 0.25 mg/kg by the 10th month). Primary endpoints were short-term efficacy, onset of improvement, time needed to obtain maximal efficacy and side effects. The authors did not differentiate between primary and secondary outcomes. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the high dose IV methylprednisolone and lower dose oral prednisone treatment groups, but there was a significant positive effect of IV methylprednisolone treatment with regard to onset of sustained improvement and time of maximal improvement (P value &lt; 0.05). Participants in the IV methylprednisolone group had fewer side effects (P value &lt; 0.05). All participants who received the 'high dose' corticosteroid treatment achieved mild to marked improvement within the 60 days.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of corticosteroids versus azathioprine</HEADING>
<P>Gajdos and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing prednisone (1 mg/kg daily for one month which was subsequently reduced to 0.5 mg/kg daily by five months and to 0.25 mg/kg daily by ten months) to azathioprine (3 mg/kg daily for one year and then 2 mg/kg daily). Because of the delayed response to azathioprine, participants were also given prednisone 1 mg/kg daily for one month, which was then progressively tapered and discontinued at the end of the fourth month. Of the planned 105 participants only 41 participants with severe generalised MG were included. Twenty participants were randomised to the prednisone and 21 to the azathioprine group. Participants had to fulfil at least one of the following criteria: persistent swallowing impairment, respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation, important reduction of daily activities for at least one month or functional deficit responsible for discontinuation of occupational activity, and decremental amplitude reduction of at least 20% or seropositivity of acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Patients with pure ocular MG, those with contraindications to corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatments, preceding treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in the past three months and patients younger than 14 years or older than 75 years were excluded. Muscle strength was assessed by a muscle strength score and a five-grade functional scale (modified Rankin scale). Primary endpoints were time to occurrence of the first episode of deterioration within the first 60 months, defined as occurrence of either impaired swallowing or respiratory failure, or a drop of at least 20 points in the myasthenic muscle strength score. Secondary endpoints were treatment failure within the first 60 months from the date of treatment onset, assessed as an increase of less than two grades in the functional scale after one year, or the occurrence of two episodes of clinical deterioration. Other endpoints were the functional grade, myasthenic muscle score at the end of each treatment year and the overall rate of side effects. In this study only an interim analysis was published after premature termination.</P>
<P>The interim analysis compared the efficacy of prednisone versus azathioprine in 41 participants. Twenty-one participants, 12 in the corticosteroid group and nine in the azathioprine group showed deterioration during the first 30 months of observation (P value = 0.4). The trialists evaluated mean improvement of muscle strength as assessed by a muscular score and functional grading at the end of each treatment year, but they did not provide the number of participants that had improved at one year nor did they differentiate between mild and marked improvement. At the end of one year there was no significant difference in mean muscular score, functional grade or side effects between the two groups. During the first two years treatment failure occurred in 17 participants, 12 in the prednisone and 5 in the azathioprine group (P value = 0.02). Even after adjustment for imbalances in prognostic factors the failure rate in the prednisone group was 2.8 times higher than in the azathioprine group. In half of the participants whose treatment failed with prednisone or azathioprine, the combined administration of the two drugs resulted in clinical improvement, i.e. remission or minor deficits, after two years of treatment. According to the intention to treat analysis, no differences were observed between the two groups in the myasthenic muscular score at the end of each year. At the end of the first year of treatment 72% in the prednisone group and 74% in the azathioprine group were in remission or had a minor deficit. The percentage of participants who experienced at least one side effect was higher in the prednisone group (80%) than in the azathioprine group (57%)(P value = 0.18).</P>
<P>Bromberg et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) conducted a small randomised, double blind crossover study of prednisone versus azathioprine. Five participants were randomised to the prednisone group and five to the azathioprine group. Only participants with generalised MG (Osserman classes 2, 3 or 4) and with no previous immunosuppressive treatment were included. In both treatment groups there were two thymectomised participants. The authors gave prednisone 60 mg per day for the first six weeks followed by a tapering schedule reaching a minimal dose of 20 mg alternating with 0 mg if tolerated. In the other group of participants azathioprine was started at a dosage of 50 mg/day and increased to 2.5 mg/kg/day over several weeks and reduced if the white cell count dropped below 4000 per microlitre.</P>
<P>Treatment response was measured after one year by a modified Rankin score and the muscle strength and function score of <LINK REF="REF-Tindall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tindall 1987</LINK> (the modified Besinger-Toyka score). Primary endpoints were change on the modified Rankin score, quantitative strength and function score, and a quantitative assessment of neuromuscular junction transmission (average decrement upon repetitive nerve stimulation). An interim analysis after one year was published. In the prednisone group after one year, one participant improved by one grade on the modified Rankin score and three participants improved by two grades. All four participants also showed an improvement in the muscle strength and function score and of the decremental response after one year. Clinical deterioration of one grade and worsening of the decremental response was seen in one participant in the prednisone group.</P>
<P>During the study period, two of the five participants in the azathioprine group were crossed over to the prednisone group immediately because of 'idiosyncratic' adverse reactions. Three participants were on azathioprine for one year. Only one of these three participants improved by one grade on the modified Rankin score and the two other participants who did not improve were then switched to prednisone. All participants who were switched from azathioprine to prednisone then improved by at least one grade on the Rankin score.</P>
<P>Mild side effects were reported in the prednisone group. Seven had weight gain, five hyperglycaemia and two insomnia (n = 2).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)</HEADING>
<P>Schuchardt et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>) conducted a randomised double-blind study (30 g IVIg daily on 5 consecutive days versus methylprednisolone for 14 days with a bodyweight (BW) adjusted dose starting at 60 mg (for greater than 60 kg BW) to 100 mg (for greater than 100 kg BW) per day and with a stepwise increase over 14 days to a final dose of 100 mg to 140 mg per day up to day 14 (unpublished manuscript provided by personal communication from KVT). Blinding was broken after 14 days. Of the 100 participants planned, only 33 people with generalised MG were enrolled with mild to moderate myasthenic exacerbation (not controlled by oral or systemic pyridostigmine and/or aggravation of MG by at least one point on the Oosterhuis-modified Osserman scale within eight weeks). Exclusion criteria were uncertainty of diagnosis, myasthenic crisis, thymectomy within the previous six months or planned within the following four weeks, glucocorticosteroid therapy of more than 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent, plasma exchange, immunoadsorption or IVIg therapy within the last 12 weeks, or known or suspected IgA deficiency (serum concentration &lt;50 mg/l). The primary endpoint was clinical improvement 14 days after start of therapy (as assessed by the sum of the two most pathological criteria of the modified Besinger-Toyka score and by the overall Besinger-Toyka score). Secondary endpoints were time to improvement of the score by one point, the time of maximum improvement and extent of improvement on day 28. Additional endpoints were number of participants with a given score (sum of the two most pathological criteria) improved or worsened on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. The study was terminated early because one of the study drugs (IVIg) was taken from the market.</P>
<P>In the interim analysis of the early terminated short-term study conducted by Schuchardt et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>) there was no statistically significant difference between the therapeutic groups. There was a trend towards a more rapid onset of improvement in the IVIg group and a trend towards a shorter time to reach maximal clinical improvement. Two participants in the IVIg group and three in the methylprednisolone group were worse at day 14, with one participant on methylprednisolone developing a myasthenic crisis and another marked hyperglycaemia. Despite the limitations of the study the authors concluded that IVIg may be useful in people not tolerating methylprednisolone.<BR/>

In the study conducted by Howard (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>) blinding could be achieved for six months only. Bromberg and co-workers had to switch two participants from the azathioprine group to the corticosteroid group due to idiosyncratic reactions shortly after beginning the study. Thus, blinding was terminated early in these participants. In the study by Gajdos (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) blinding was terminated soon after randomisation due to the side effects of the medication. In the study conducted by Zhang (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) neither the participants nor the observers were blinded. In the study by Schuchardt et al. blinding was achieved by the administration of placebo tablets in the IVIg group and intravenous human albumin in the corticosteroid group and the study duration was too short to allow long-term side effects of glucocorticosteroids to become notable.</P>

<P>Gajdos and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) included only participants with signs of generalised MG and precisely-defined persistent deficits for at least one month. Then the participants were randomised through a blinded assignment procedure with blocks of four participants, stratified by a centre according to whether or not participants had had thymectomy. There were only two participants with thymoma in each group. The authors stated that the trial was not blind due to the side effects of the medication.</P>

Thus, there were some participants who were not stable at the time point of evaluation. Furthermore, a minimum time interval for defining 'stable improvement' was not defined. Therefore, interpretation of the outcome data and comparison of the results with those of other studies is restricted. Zhang included participants with juvenile MG of different Osserman types (ocular, bulbar and mild generalised) but did not define the treatment responses in the different patient groups exactly. In the other studies the description of types of participants was adequate.</P>

<P>Gajdos and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) adjusted their data retrospectively according to 'prognostic factors' (higher mean muscle score and antibody titre in the azathioprine group). The other authors did not deal with baseline differences except for the Schuchardt study (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>, unpublished manuscript provided by personal communication from KVT) which clearly defined eligible participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Mount (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>) followed all the participants for three months. In the study by Howard et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>) the outcome of at least one participant was unclear at the time point of evaluation after two years. The participant was 'currently hospitalised for increasing prednisone doses' which may indicate exacerbation. Lindberg and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) re-examined their participants until 14 weeks after having received the short-term treatment of 2 g methylprednisolone on 2 consecutive days and follow-up was complete.</P>
<P>In the study conducted by Gajdos and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) participants were followed up for a mean of 30 months. All of the 41 participants completed the trial. In the first year participants were seen at month 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 and then every 6 months.</P>
<P>In the study by Bromberg and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) the observation period was only one year. It is unclear whether this period was long enough to evaluate treatment effects of azathioprine, in particular since only one of three participants who remained on azathioprine was treated with azathioprine alone. However, the authors concluded the observation period was reasonable and long enough for a 'chronic and disabling neuromuscular disorder'. Zhang 1998 (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) did not follow-up their participants. In the Schuchardt short-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>, unpublished manuscript provided by personal communication from KVT) follow-up was complete.</P>

In the Bromberg study (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>), due to the fact that most participants received prednisone eventually, it was difficult to compare the effects of prednisone versus azathioprine. Furthermore, the total number of participants in whom the corticosteroid effect could be judged was very small. In addition, due to the cross-over, regular statistical evaluation is not possible. We dealt with this study as follows: we did not include those participants initially randomised to azathioprine and then crossed over later to prednisone. We only evaluated eight participants: five who were initially randomised to prednisone and two that were first randomised to azathioprine but switched to prednisone very early on, and the one participant who stayed on azathioprine. In the corticosteroid group (including the two early cross-over participants) six participants improved whereas only one participant improved on azathioprine.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(5) Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>In the Howard study (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>) the following side effects were reported as 'minimal': some increase in weakness during the first three weeks of prednisone therapy especially on the off-prednisone day. Insomnia was reported in three participants in the corticosteroid group and in three participants in the placebo group. In the Lindberg study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) no 'serious side effects' were encountered. In one participant mild diabetes was noted. In the Zhang trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) Cushingoid features occurred in 19 children, and hypertension and initial worsening of MG in two children. In the Bromberg study (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) no noteworthy side effects aside from idiosyncratic reactions, occurred among the participants on azathioprine. In the prednisone group weight gain occurred in seven, hyperglycaemia in five and insomnia in two participants. In the Gajdos trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>) 67 adverse events in 28 participants were reported and included: Cushingoid features, bacterial, viral and fungal infections, systemic hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, psychiatric disorders, hair loss, polymorphonuclear white cell and liver enzyme or alkaline phosphatase elevation (only in the azathioprine group). The percentage of side effects was significantly higher in the prednisone group (80%) than in the azathioprine group (57%). These figures are quite close to what is reported in retrospective studies. For example one or more side effects were reported in 66.7% of the 116 myasthenic participants treated with corticosteroids by Pascuzzi (<LINK REF="REF-Pascuzzi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascuzzi 1984</LINK>) and in 68% of 1041 participants treated by Evoli (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1992</LINK>). In the Schuchardt trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>, unpublished manuscript provided by personal communication from KVT) no adverse events were encountered in the IVIg group. In the prednisone group mild pathological laboratory findings and urinary tract infection each occurred in one participant.</P>
<P>In summary, secondary outcome measures in the included studies were quite heterogeneous. It was impossible to adapt the outcome criteria to the criteria we had selected for evaluation in the protocol for this review. Lindberg and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) chose AChR antibody titres as a secondary outcome despite the fact that their trial was a short-term study. AChR antibodies remained unchanged during a maximum follow up of 14 weeks. Bromberg and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) chose the average decremental response in each treatment group, but not changes of AChR titre, as a paraclinical criterion. Schuchardt and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>, unpublished manuscript provided by personal communication from KVT) defined time to improvement of the score by one point and the time of maximum improvement and extent of improvement on day 28 as secondary endpoints and the number of participants with a score (sum of the two most abnormal criteria) improved or worsened on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 as additional outcome criteria. In summary, transformation of the authors' outcome criteria into the outcome criteria proposed in our protocol was not possible in most of the studies. The same was true for the secondary outcome criteria. We have therefore reported each study separately giving the primary outcome criteria proposed by the authors in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 18:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Only six studies comparing the effects of ACTH or corticosteroids in 76 participants with those of placebo, azathioprine or IVIg in 84 participants were suitable for inclusion in this review. A further study compared high and low steroid doses in 39 participants. None fulfilled the presently accepted standards of a high-quality trial. Some were designed when these standards were not yet clearly defined. Of the more recent trials at least three were designed according to the 'gold standard' but had to be terminated prematurely for various reasons, with only a fraction of the planned participant numbers studied. None of these recent trials used a placebo-only treatment arm for ethical reasons. This makes it difficult to judge the efficacy of corticosteroids alone. Inclusion criteria differed considerably: one trial included only ocular MG (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>), one ocular and generalised MG (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) and the others only generalised MG. Moreover, most studies suffered from a high degree of variability in disease severity and some severely affected participants would have to be excluded from the treatment options if presently accepted treatment standards were applied. In the study by Zhang, different doses and application regimens were compared in 39 participants (19 and 20 in each group) with juvenile MG to evaluate short-term efficacy of corticosteroid therapy, onset of improvement, time needed to obtain maximal efficacy and side effects of the two different therapies.</P>
<P>One advantage of a systematic review is that it might give sufficient power to detect significant differences between subgroups which were not evident from individual trials. Unfortunately, data from subgroups were not extractable from the available studies. In particular data from thymectomised and non-thymectomised patients could not be differentially evaluated.</P>
<P>This review has also revealed many weaknesses in the design of trials in MG. The primary outcome measures were quite different in the different studies, which made pooling of data difficult or impossible. In particular, although functional scores for assessing weakness in MG were established in the early eighties improvement/deterioration was assessed in some studies by a modified Rankin score which was originally used to assess impairment in stroke patients. The modified Rankin scale may not adequately detect changes of strength in MG and does not seem appropriate for the assessment of bulbar functions. Electrophysiological outcome measures have been used in one study only. Thus, most studies lack objective assessment of myasthenic weakness during follow-up.</P>
<P>No trial has included health-related quality of life measures or assessed cost-effectiveness. Adverse events have been reported in some but not all studies, and side effects may not have been thoroughly investigated. Deteriorations during the first days of corticosteroid treatment were not mentioned in any of the studies which is surprising. More or less severe initial deterioration is usually reported in retrospective case series with a rate ranging from 21% (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1992</LINK>) to 48% (<LINK REF="REF-Pascuzzi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascuzzi 1984</LINK>). However deterioration occurring after corticosteroids were started might be a sign of ongoing disease progression rather than due to intrinsic adverse effects of corticosteroids.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">ACTH versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>The trial by Mount (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>) did not show any evidence of efficacy of ACTH for ocular MG. However, observational studies have shown that corticosteroids are effective in most cases of ocular MG (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>The interpretation of the results of the study by Howard and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1976</LINK>) is difficult. Lack of description of the clinical data of each participant makes it impossible to follow up the response to treatment in single participants or subgroups for longer than the first six months. The data at two years are observations at a distinct time-point, but cannot be interpreted in a clinical context. Due to the small number of participants statistical evaluation of single clinical or electrophysiological parameters at six months was not possible. In addition, five participants required pyridostigmine on the day of the repetitive nerve conduction test during the first weeks, and two of these required pyridostigmine for each EMG, i.e. these participants could not tolerate interruption of pyridostigmine medication for 12 hours. Since the electrophysiological data are not presented in detail, elimination of the data of the participants who needed pyridostigmine at the time-point of examination was not possible. Overall this trial does not provide evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Lindberg and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberg 1998</LINK>) conducted a short-term, two-week study comparing methylprednisolone pulse (MP) therapy versus placebo. The results of this study were limited to a group of participants with moderate MG (Osserman class 2 or 3). There was a significant effect of corticosteroids at two weeks but the statistical power of this result was very weak with only 10 participants included in each arm. Comparison with other studies was difficult due to the short duration of the study, and we decided to not combine the Lindberg study with the early part of the Howard study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intravenous versus oral corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>In the Chinese study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) the exact duration of the study is not given. In particular we do not know how many participants achieved remission and how many participants still needed corticosteroids one year after the beginning of the treatment period and at what dose. Therefore long-term effects of the treatment modalities in this study cannot be judged. In fact the available data from this study do not establish the efficacy of corticosteroids themselves.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids versus azathioprine</HEADING>
<P>Gajdos and co-workers published the second interim analysis of their study of prednisone versus azathioprine in 1993 (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>). At this time the duration of mean follow-up was 30 months. In this study the participants assigned to the azathioprine group received prednisone concurrently at a dosage of 60 mg for the first month followed by a three-month taper. This procedure was chosen since a delay in response to azathioprine can be expected for the first three months. Therefore, the efficacy of prednisone alone cannot be assessed at three months and Gajdos and co-workers did not find statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the primary outcome criterion (time to relapse). The only significant difference was a lower occurrence of treatment failure in the azathioprine group (P value = 0.02). The positive long-term results in both treatment groups were limited to the subgroup of less severely affected participants. During the second and subsequent years nearly half of the participants received combined therapy of azathioprine and prednisone, which blurred the issue of the efficacy of prednisone or azathioprine as the sole drug. Due to the inclusion criteria, participants with severe bulbar involvement including participants with respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation were recruited. Based on observational studies both treatment arms ran the risk of being not sufficiently effective in this critical situation. Treatment failure was more frequent in severely affected participants treated by prednisone alone. The combination of prednisone and azathioprine produced remission or minor deficit in half the participants. The trial was not specifically designed to assess the efficacy of the combination of the two drugs versus prednisone alone and only about half of the planned participants were included, limiting the conclusions that could be drawn. A similar trial was published by Palace et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Palace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palace 1998</LINK>) which demonstrated significant benefit from prednisone plus azathioprine compared with prednisone alone in terms of treatment failure, remission, reduction of the maintenance dose of prednisone and side effects, although only 34 of the 100 participants planned were included. The steroid-sparing effect of other immunosuppressive drugs was approached in other trials. A trial published by Nagane (<LINK REF="REF-Nagane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagane 2005</LINK>) demonstrated no significant difference in clinical outcome (minimal manifestations and mean severity score) from FK506 plus prednisone compared with prednisone alone but a significant benefit from FK506 plus prednisone in terms of high dose methylprednisolone used during the first year and also in terms of the dose of prednisolone at one year. However, this trial was unblinded and included only 34 participants. More recently a large international RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2008</LINK>) of mycophenolate mofetil plus prednisone compared to prednisone alone, which included 176 participants, failed to demonstrate any difference between the two treatment groups at week 36 in a composite endpoint (minimal manifestations or pharmacological remission, 7.5 mg/day prednisone, 120 mg/day pyridostigmine) as well as in term of cumulative dose of prednisone. This lack of steroid-sparing effect could be in part related to the design of the protocol which imposed a slow tapering dosage of prednisone with a goal of 7.5 mg/day at week 36.</P>
<P>The study by Bromberg and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Bromberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bromberg 1997</LINK>) aimed to test the effect of azathioprine alone right from the beginning. In the study of Gajdos et al. the time to relapse was measured, in the Bromberg study muscle strength and functional scores according to Tindall (<LINK REF="REF-Tindall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tindall 1987</LINK>) and a modified Rankin score were used for assessment of muscle strength and functional disability. In addition, quantitative assessment of neuromuscular transmission was performed. In this study only five participants were included in each arm and for various reasons only two of the five participants could stay on azathioprine alone and were then switched to the corticosteroid group. No conclusion can be drawn from this trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Immunoglobulin versus corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Schuchardt and colleagues failed to reveal any significant difference in the efficacy of the two treatments up to 14 days in the interim analysis of their short-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Schuchardt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schuchardt 2004</LINK>). This conclusion is limited by the very low number of participants included which may have masked a mild difference. Moreover, no conclusion could be drawn as to outcome and efficacy at later time points.</P>
<P>As pointed out above, secondary outcome measures in the included studies were quite heterogeneous. It was impossible to adapt the outcome criteria to the criteria we had selected for evaluation. In summary, transformation of the authors' outcome criteria into our predefined outcome criteria was not possible in most of the studies. The same was true for the secondary outcome criteria. We therefore evaluated each study separately according to the primary outcome criteria proposed by the authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reflections</HEADING>
<P>Finally, we have to cope with a paradoxical situation. Corticosteroids or ACTH have been used for 70 years in the treatment of MG but there is no significant evidence from randomised clinical trials to show the efficacy of corticosteroids whatever the severity of the disease, the dosage or the route of administration of the drug. However, numerous observational studies (see Background section) strongly support the efficacy of corticosteroids for the treatment of MG. It is the opinion of the authors of this review and of many experts (<LINK REF="REF-Gajdos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gajdos 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richman 2003</LINK>) that corticosteroids are the mainstay of the treatment for MG, in particular in mild and moderately severe myasthenia. Therefore it would be unfeasible and unethical to now perform trials of corticosteroids versus placebo. Many questions are unanswered and should be the purpose of future RCTs. Issues of current concern are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>in what situations should corticosteroids be started, should they be used in ocular MG? Should they be used in MG with mild deficit?</LI>
<LI>what are the most appropriate doses: starting with high doses or gradually increasing doses? Daily doses or alternate-day regimens? What is the best way of tapering treatment? What is the optimum duration of treatment?</LI>
<LI>the efficacy of corticosteroids alone versus new immunosuppressive drugs alone (such as mycophenolate mofetil) as initial treatment.</LI>
<LI>the efficacy of corticosteroids alone versus their combination with different immunosuppressive drugs.</LI>
<LI>the steroid-sparing effect on corticosteroid dosage of different immunosuppressive drugs or of intravenous immunoglobulin.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Even with the ethical limitations in mind it should theoretically be feasible to study some of these questions in a prospective way in an RCT. This would only be possible in large multicentre trials.</P>
<P>In future studies inclusion criteria should be clearly defined. The severity of MG should be specified using the classification of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (<LINK REF="REF-Jaretzki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaretzki 2000</LINK>). The concomitant treatment should be described. The primary outcome measure for an RCT testing the efficacy of IVIg for the treatment of MG exacerbations or crisis could be the change in a muscle strength score 15 or 30 days after initiation of IVIg. In RCTs looking at improvement in functional outcome in people with moderate or severe MG, the best outcome measure could be the change in functional class or the change in post-intervention status as recently proposed by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (<LINK REF="REF-Jaretzki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaretzki 2000</LINK>). In order to demonstrate the sparing effect of IVIg on corticosteroid dosage, the outcome measure could be the cumulative dose of corticosteroids necessary to obtain and maintain a remission. The number of participants to be included in these trials should be carefully calculated so that the power of the main comparison will allow valid conclusions.<BR/>

<P>Limited evidence from RCTs suggests that corticosteroid treatment offers short-term benefit in MG compared with placebo. This supports the conclusions of observational studies and expert opinion. Limited evidence from RCTs does not show any difference in efficacy between corticosteroids and either azathioprine or IVIg.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Because of supportive evidence from observational studies, RCTs comparing glucocorticosteroids with placebo would be inappropriate and unethical. Future research should be directed at determining the situations in which glucocorticosteroids should be started, the most appropriate doses and duration of treatment, the efficacy of corticosteroids versus new immunosuppressive drugs alone as initial treatment, the efficacy of corticosteroids alone versus their combination with different immunosuppressive drugs, and the steroid-sparing effect on corticosteroids dosage of different immunosuppressive drugs or of intravenous immunoglobulin. International consensus should be sought concerning the most appropriate outcome measures for studying the effect of interventions in MG.</P>
