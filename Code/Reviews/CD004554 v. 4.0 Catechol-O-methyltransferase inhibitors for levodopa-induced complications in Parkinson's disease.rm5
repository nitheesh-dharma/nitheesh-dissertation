<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>The COMT inhibitors entacapone and tolcapone show similar benefits in relieving levodopa-induced complications in Parkinson's disease but more data on the safety of tolcapone is required.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>As Parkinson's disease progresses the control of the symptoms often requires the addition of other drugs to levodopa. The principle aim of COMT inhibitor therapy is to increase the duration of effect of each levodopa dose and thus reduce the time patients spend in the relatively immobile 'off' phase. Tolcapone and entacapone can be used to reduce off time, reduce levodopa dose, and modestly improve motor impairment and disability. This is based on, at best, medium term evidence. However some participants on tolcapone had raised liver enzymes. Post-marketing surveillance identified three cases of fatal hepatic toxicity in patients treated with tolcapone. As a result, tolcapone has been withdrawn from some countries and severe restrictions on its use have been imposed in others.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>As Parkinson's disease progresses the control of motor symptoms often requires the addition of other drugs to levodopa. The principle aim of COMT inhibitor therapy is to increase the duration of effect of each levodopa dose and thus reduce the time patients spend in the relatively immobile 'off' phase. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1974-2003), were conducted. Grey literature was hand searched and the reference lists of identified studies and reviews examined. The manufacturers of COMT inhibitors were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy versus a placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 2566 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations were included in this review. Eight trials examined entacapone versus placebo in a total of 1560 patients. These trials were between two and twelve months in duration. Six trials examined tolcapone versus placebo in a total of 1006 patients. These trials were between six weeks and twelve months in duration.</P>
<P>Both tolcapone and entacapone reduced 'off' time, reduced levodopa dose and modestly improved motor impairments and disability. This was at the expense of increased risk of dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. A few participants taking tolcapone were found to have raised liver enzyme levels.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, tolcapone and entacapone can be used to reduce off time, reduce levodopa dose, and modestly improve motor impairment and disability. This is based on, at best, medium term evidence. However some participants on tolcapone had raised liver enzymes. This combined with three cases of fatal hepatic toxicity found during post-marketing surveillance has raised concerns over the safety of tolcapone.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Over 20 years after its introduction, levodopa remains the most effective therapy in Parkinson's disease. However, with long-term treatment, patients develop side effects comprised of motor and psychiatric complications. The former consist of involuntary writhing movements of the face, limbs and trunk (choreoathetosis), painful cramps often affecting the feet (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose of levodopa (end-of-dose deterioration). These affect 50% of patients after 6 years of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rajput-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajput 1984</LINK>) and 100% of young onset patients after a similar period of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to reduce these adverse responses to fluctuations in dopaminergic stimulation various therapeutic strategies can be adopted. These include using more frequent smaller doses of levodopa, controlled release formulations, additional dopamine agonists or continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that catalyses the metabolism of levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa. Drugs that inhibit COMT prolong the maintenance of serum levodopa levels and hence produce a longer and more stable clinical response (<LINK REF="REF-Bonifati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonifati 1999</LINK>). There are two COMT inhibitors used in clinical practice at present: tolcapone and entacapone.</P>
<P>The efficacy and safety of COMT inhibitors have been examined in early Parkinson's disease, before motor complications have developed, and in the later stages of the condition, when patients have motor complications as a result of levodopa therapy. Trials in later disease have lead to COMT inhibitors being licensed for this indication in the expectation of a reduction in off time and improved motor function. There has been controversy over the licensing of tolcapone. Concerns over several deaths from liver toxicity thought to be induced by tolcapone led to the withdrawal of the European drug license, although the drug is still available in the USA provided stringent hepatic monitoring is performed (<LINK REF="REF-EAEM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAEM 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The present systematic review examines all randomised controlled trials of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy compared with placebo in later Parkinson's disease with motor complications to establish its efficacy and tolerability. A separate review covers the effects of adjuvant COMT inhibitors versus active comparators.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised trials comparing adjuvant COMT inhibitors with placebo were considered for inclusion in the study.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease who had developed long-term motor complications of dyskinesia and/or end-of-dose deterioration. All ages were included. Any duration of levodopa therapy was included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Oral tolcapone or entacapone therapy versus placebo. Trial durations of greater than 4 weeks were included. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Improvement in the time patients spend in the immobile 'off' state.</P>
<P>2. Changes in dyskinesia rating scales and the prevalence of dyskinesia.</P>
<P>3. Changes in Parkinsonian rating scales.</P>
<P>4. Reduction in levodopa dose.</P>
<P>5. Frequency of adverse events</P>
<P>6. Number of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy and/or side-effects.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. The review was based on the search strategy of the Movement Disorders Group. This included computerised searches of MEDLINE (1966-2003) and EMBASE (1974-2003) and hand searching of appropriate neurology journals. Relevant trials were included on the Group's specialised register of randomised controlled trials. Further details are available in the Group's module on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</P>
<P>2. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2003) was also searched for relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. The reference lists of located trials and of other COMT inhibitor reviews were searched.</P>
<P>4. Additional assistance was provided by the drug manufacturers, Orion and Roche.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The two authors (CEC, KD) independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion. The full papers were assessed for methodological quality by recording the method of randomisation and blinding, whether an intention to treat analysis was used and the number of patients lost to follow up.</P>
<P>Eligible data was abstracted onto standardised forms by the authors independently, checked for accuracy and amalgamated. A weighted estimate (fixed effect model) of the typical treatment effect across trials was calculated for continuous (weighted mean difference) and dichotomous (Peto odds ratio) variables such as 'off' time and prevalence of adverse events.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>See also Characteristics of Included Studies Table and Results of Included Studies.</P>
<P>Fourteen trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a total of 2569 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations included in this review. </P>
<P>ENTACAPONE<BR/>Eight studies compared entacapone against placebo with 1563 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brooks-UK_x002d_IRISH-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks UK-IRISH 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poewe-CELOMEN-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Poewe CELOMEN 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PSG-SEESAW-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PSG SEESAW 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rinne-NOMECOMT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rinne NOMECOMT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>). One study had a randomised double blind cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>), the remaining seven studies had a randomised, double-blind parallel-group design. One was a phase II study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>) the remaining seven were phase III studies.</P>
<P>Patients were well balanced across the arms of the studies in terms of age and Hoehn and Yahr score (see Characteristics of Included Studies).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK> did not state the dose of entacapone used in their study, however all of the remaining seven trials used 200 mg of entacapone with each of the patient's levodopa doses, up to 10 doses per day. This is comparable with the present recommended dose of 200 mg of entacapone with each of the patient's levodopa doses, to a maximum of 2g per day.</P>
<P>Levodopa dose reduction was not allowed in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>), the remaining trials all allowed levodopa dose reduction.</P>
<P>TOLCAPONE<BR/>Six studies compared tolcapone against placebo with 1006 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK>). All six studies had a randomised, double-blind parallel-group design. All were phase III studies.</P>
<P>Patients were well balanced across the arms of the studies in terms of age and Hoehn and Yahr score (see Characteristics of Included Studies).<BR/> <BR/>Patients received between 50 mg tid and 400 mg tid tolcapone. This is comparable with the present recommended dose of 100 mg tid tolcapone in the USA and up to 200 mg tid in Europe until it was withdrawn. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>) did not add 0.5 mg riboflavin to the placebo tablet in order to mimic the yellow discolouration in the urine of participants that occurs with tolcapone as a harmless side-effect.</P>
<P>Levodopa dose reduction was allowed in all six trials.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>For more details see Characteristics of Included Studies Table</P>
<P>ENTACAPONE<BR/>The quality of the reporting of the entacapone trials was such that we had to contact the manufacturer for further details on both methodology and results.</P>
<P>The method of randomisation and concealment of allocation was adequately described in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brooks-UK_x002d_IRISH-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks UK-IRISH 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poewe-CELOMEN-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Poewe CELOMEN 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PSG-SEESAW-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PSG SEESAW 1997</LINK>), but five studies did not (<LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rinne-NOMECOMT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rinne NOMECOMT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>). The majority of the reports were published after the first publication of the CONSORT guidelines in 1996 which recommend the full description of the method of randomisation and concealment of allocation. However it is recognised that two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>) were only available as abstracts and so methodological details will necessarily be brief. This emphasises the importance of full publication of trials. As all of the studies were conducted by pharmaceutical companies in accordance with regulatory authorities' guidelines it is likely that the randomisation method and concealment of allocation were of high quality. However an accurate judgement of these methodological quality items cannot be made without the data. </P>
<P>Patients that participated in the trials were stated to have idiopathic Parkinson's disease but no diagnostic criteria were stated in any of the trials. Except for the two studies reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>), the baseline characteristics were provided for all of the treatment groups and the number of patients who withdrew from the trials were stated along with the reasons for the withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK> did not state the method used to analyse their data. <LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK> analysed the data on a per protocol basis which could have introduced performance and attrition bias. The remaining five trials analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis. However <LINK REF="STD-Brooks-UK_x002d_IRISH-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks UK-IRISH 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Poewe-CELOMEN-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Poewe CELOMEN 2002</LINK> presented data from only 'observed cases' which means that withdrawals were not accounted for by using the so-called 'last observation carried forward' method. <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PSG-SEESAW-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PSG SEESAW 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rinne-NOMECOMT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rinne NOMECOMT 1998</LINK> used the last observation carried forward method which they considered to be a form of intention-to-treat analysis. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK> was of cross-over design. The results presented were a combination of the two phases of the trial and as such could have been affected by carry-over effects. </P>
<P>TOLCAPONE<BR/>All six trials were randomised using computer generated random number tables. A separate randomisation schedule was done for each centre; usually in block sizes twice the number of treatment arms. So if a trial used 10 centres for a study with four treatment arms, 10 sets of codes were created each in blocks of eight, i.e. with two of each treatment in each block of eight. The patients were allocated in a double-blind method with the code not being broken until after the database was closed.</P>
<P>Patients were always diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to the United Kingdom's Brain Bank Criteria for Parkinson's Disease. The baseline characteristics were provided for all of the treatment groups. The number of patients who withdrew from the trials were stated along with the reasons for the withdrawal.</P>
<P>All of the trials analysed their data using the last observation carried forward method. Four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK>) provided some or all of their data as least squares estimates of the mean treatment effects in each centre. This was described as "the unweighted averages of centre means with the covariate as its mean value". The nature of the covariate was not stated and was not clarified in our communications with the manufacturer. From the statistical advice we have gained, we believe it reasonable to assume that these least square means were closely equivalent to the true arithmetical means. The data for the results were presented in a manner that could be synthesised (i.e. mean change, standard deviation (SD) of change and patient numbers) in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>). Additional data on <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK> were provided by the manufacturer allowing analysis of levodopa dose, on and off times and adverse events. However, only 49 patients participated in the quality of life assessment in <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK>; the data for SIP and UPDRS motor scale were presented correctly for meta-analysis, but the PAIS-SR was given as baseline and endpoint mean and SD but no SD of change. <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK> provided the levodopa dose and UPDRS data correctly but 'off' time and Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) had no SD provided.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>ENTACAPONE<BR/>We found eight randomised controlled trials examining entacapone against placebo in a total of 1560 patients. Seven of the trials were parallel group design (n=1534), and one small trial was of a cross-over design (n=26).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Brooks-UK_x002d_IRISH-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks UK-IRISH 2003</LINK> study examined 300 participants but only 172 had fluctuating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The study's results discussed below relate only to these 172 participants who met the inclusion criteria for the review. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK> had a cross-over design. The published results presented were a combination of the two phases of the trial and as such could have been affected by carry-over effects.

From these trials the weighted mean difference in levodopa dose reduction between entacapone and placebo was 55 mg/day (95% CI: 37, 74 mg/day, P&lt;0.00001, Figure 1).

<P>Sections of the UPDRS were assessed in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brooks-UK_x002d_IRISH-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks UK-IRISH 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poewe-CELOMEN-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Poewe CELOMEN 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PSG-SEESAW-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PSG SEESAW 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rinne-NOMECOMT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rinne NOMECOMT 1998</LINK>).

However we were unable to calculate accurately the mean difference in either the ADL or Motor sections of the UPDRS in any of these trials from the data provided.</P>
<P>Tables summarising the most common adverse events were not available in the abstracts of <LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>. In view of the large number of analyses, particularly of adverse events, we will only comment on those where the P value is smaller than 0.01. Entacapone increased significantly adverse events such as dyskinesia (Peto OR 2.23, P&lt;0.00001, Figure 6.1). Also nausea (Peto OR 1.93, P=0.0006, Figure 6.2), vomiting (Peto OR 4.16, P=0.01, Figure 6.3), diarrhoea (Peto OR 2.69, P=0.0001, Figure 6.4), and constipation (Peto OR 2.27 P=0.007, Figure 6.5). Dizziness was of borderline significance (Peto OR 1.95 P=0.01, Figure 6.7). Hallucinations were not increased on entacapone (Peto OR 1.08, P=0.8, Figure 6.6).</P>
<P>Transaminase levels were considered to be clinically significant if they were raised more than three times beyond the upper limit of the reference range. In <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-FILOMEN-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla FILOMEN 2001</LINK> one patient on entacapone had a clinically significant rise in alanine transaminase (ALT) level, but as all values before and after were normal it was suspected that there was due to a laboratory error. Another patient had clinically significant elevations in ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) due to acute cholecystitis unrelated to entacapone treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Poewe-CELOMEN-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Poewe CELOMEN 2002</LINK> one patient on entacapone and one on placebo had clinically significant rises in their transaminase levels for one visit each.</P>
<P>The two trials published as abstracts did not note the withdrawal rate due to adverse events or due to any causes (<LINK REF="STD-Fenelon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fenelon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Im-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Im 2002</LINK>). Overall entacapone increased the likelihood that participants would withdraw due to adverse events (Peto OR 1.52, P=0.02, Figure 7.1) or due to all causes (Peto OR 1.40, P=0.04, Figure 7.2) although the levels of statistical significance were not high.</P>
<P>TOLCAPONE<BR/>We found six parallel group randomised controlled trials examining tolcapone versus placebo in a total of 1006 patients.</P>
<P>The manufacturer provided us with unpublished methodological details but no additional data. All of the data were from relatively short term trials: four were 6 weeks long (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>), and one 3 months long (<LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK> the primary end point was 3 months when the efficacy data was recorded but patients could continue double-blind treatment thereafter for up to a total of 12 months. The study was terminated on a common closing date when approximately 30% of patients had completed 1 year of treatment. </P>
<P>The tolcapone trials used a variety of doses of the drug. Three trials examined the efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 200 mg tolcapone (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK>), two trials 50 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg tolcapone (<LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>) and one trial 200 mg and 400 mg tolcapone (<LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>). The dose that was common to them all was 200 mg tolcapone. We have included the data on all of the doses of tolcapone from these trials in the Forest plots in Figures 1 to 7. This involves using the placebo data on more than one occasion. This may lead to potential problems if some imbalance had entered the placebo arm of one of the trials (e.g. higher proportion of patients on a large dose of levodopa); this potential bias will be perpetuated in multiple tolcapone dose comparisons. However, such imbalance is unlikely from the information available from the trials. We therefore feel justified in using this approach which has been used by other groups.</P>
<P>Levodopa dose reduction was allowed in all the six trials examined. In <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK> there was an error in the footnote to the table which contained the levodopa dose reduction data. The footnote stated that the data was presented as mean and standard deviation. However this was in fact the standard error of the mean which was confirmed in correspondence with the authors of the study. The weighted mean difference in levodopa dose reduction showed a dose response trend (although this could not be tested further with RevMan software) and a fall off with the highest dose (Figure 1): 50 mg tolcapone produced a levodopa dose reduction of 72 mg/day (95% CI: 27 mg, 117 mg, P=0.001), 100 mg gave a 156 mg/day reduction (95% CI: 120 mg, 191 mg, P=0.00001), 200 mg gave a 148 mg/day reduction (95% CI: 123 mg, 174 mg, P=0.00001) and 400 mg gave a 55 mg/day reduction (95% CI: 18 mg, 93 mg, P=0.003). The analysis of the results for the 200 mg tolcapone dose showed significant heterogeneity (P&lt;0.00001) which could not be resolved by the removal of any one study from the analysis.</P>
<P>'Off' time reduction was available for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK> measured 'off' time but did not provide the standard error of means that would have enabled us to include the results. <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK> did not measure this outcome in their study. Three of the trials used patient completed diaries for 16 hour days (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK> also used patient completed diaries, these data were presented without any standard deviations. Therefore we used the investigator's evaluation of 'off' time over a 10 hour day. The weighted mean difference in 'off' time reduction (Figure 2) showed that the 50 mg dose was the least effective (1 hour 25 minutes, 95% CI: 46 min, 2 hours 3 minutes, P=0.00002), whilst the remaining doses were equivalent: 100 mg producing 1 hour 32 minutes off time reduction (95% CI: 54 min, 2 hours 10 minutes, P=0.00001), 200 mg giving 1 hour 38 minutes (95% CI: 1 hour 11 min, 2 hours 5 minutes, P=0.00001) and 400 mg giving 1 hour 35 minutes (95% CI: 55 min, 2 hours 16 minutes, P=0.00001) reduction in 'off' time. None of the analyses showed significant heterogeneity between studies.</P>
<P>'On' time increase was available for the same four trials as 'off' time. <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK> did not measure this outcome in their studies. As before <LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK> used patient completed diaries for 16 hour days whilst <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK> provided the investigator's evaluation of 'off' time over a 10 hour day. Overall the 'on' time increases were similar to the 'off' time reduction (Figure 3): 50 mg tolcapone produced a 1 hour 38 minutes increase in 'on' time ( 95% CI: 56 min, 2 hours 20 minutes, P=0.00001), 100 mg gave 1 hour 48 minutes (95% CI: 1 hour 7 min, 2 hours 29 minutes, P=0.00001), 200 mg gave 1 hour 55 minutes ( 95% CI: 1 hour 26 min, 2 hours 23 minutes, P=0.00001) and 400 mg gave 1 hour 32 minutes (95% CI: 48 min, 2 hours 16 minutes, P=0.00004). None of the analyses showed significant heterogeneity between the studies.</P>
<P>Activities of daily living were assessed using the UPDRS in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK> found a statistically significant difference in UPDRS ADL scale (P&lt;0.05) at 200 mg: placebo change increase of 0.4 versus tolcapone 200 mg reduction of 1.1 points. The Motor section of the UPDRS was recorded in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK>). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK>) found a significant difference (P&lt;0.01) at 200 mg: placebo reduction 2.1 versus tolcapone 200 mg reduction of 6.5 points.</P>
<P>In view of the large number of analyses, particularly of adverse events, we will only comment on those where the P value is small than 0.01. Tolcapone significantly increased the risk of dyskinesia (Figure 6.1) at the 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg doses (Peto Odds ratios (P values) of 3.48 (0.0002), 3.96 (0.00001) and 4.51 (0.00001) respectively). Tolcapone significantly increased the risk of nausea (Figure 6.2) at the 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg doses (Peto Odds ratios (P values) of 2.03 (0.003), 2.64 (0.00001)and 2.80 (0.009) respectively. Tolcapone produced a borderline increase in the risk of vomiting (Figure 6.3) at the 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg doses (Peto Odds ratios (P values) of 5.60 (0.01), 4.28 (0.01) and 3.67 (0.003) respectively). Tolcapone significantly increased the risk of diarrhoea (Figure 6.4) at the 200 mg dose (Peto Odds ratio (P value) 2.52 (0.003)). Tolcapone significantly increased the risk of hallucinations (Figure 6.6) at the 200 mg dose (Peto Odds ratio (P value) 2.65 (0.002)).</P>
<P>The levels of transaminases were considered to be clinically significant if they were raised more than three times beyond the reference range. No changes in liver function tests were reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kurth-TFSGI-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth TFSGI 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myllyla-TIPS1-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myllyla TIPS1 1997</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Rajput-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rajput 1997</LINK> tolcapone was associate with raised AST and ALT concentrations in three patients in the tolcapone 100 mg group and two in the 200 mg group, one of whom (from the 200 mg group) withdrew from the study as a result. In this patient, the values were three to five times the upper limit of normal but the patient was asymptomatic. No follow up data on these patients were given. <LINK REF="STD-Baas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baas 1997</LINK> reported an elevation of mean AST and ALT levels at Week 6 in the tolcapone 200 mg group compared with placebo; this resolved throughout the rest of the trial. However they found three patients (one on 100 mg and two on 200 mg) with consistently abnormal AST and ALT levels. One of these on 200 mg tolcapone withdrew on Day 113 but transaminases were normal by Day 169.</P>
<P>Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported in all six trials. There was no significant increase in withdrawals due to adverse events in those patients on tolcapone (Figure 7.1). Only <LINK REF="STD-Adler-TFSGIII-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adler TFSGIII 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dupont-TIPSII-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dupont TIPSII 1997</LINK> provided any data on all cause withdrawal rates. There was no significant increase in withdrawals in those patients on tolcapone (Figure 7.2).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Eight randomised controlled trials have attempted to establish the efficacy and safety of entacapone versus placebo in Parkinson's disease with motor complications. The total number of randomised patients was 1560. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Ruottinen-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ruottinen 1996 (a)</LINK>) was a small short term phase II study of two months duration. The remaining phase III trials varied significantly in their duration; between two months and one year. Six randomised controlled trials have attempted to establish the efficacy and safety of tolcapone versus placebo in Parkinson's disease with motor complications. The total number of randomised patients was 1006. All of these phase III studies were of relatively short duration, between 6 weeks and 3 months long.</P>
<P>The principle aim of COMT-inhibitor therapy is to increase the duration of effect of the levodopa dose and thus reduce the time patients spend in the relatively immobile 'off' phase. Entacapone provided a statistically and clinically significant reduction in 'off' time of 41 minutes when compared to placebo at the only dose examined (200 mg with each dose of levodopa). Tolcapone provided a statistically significant reduction in 'off' time when compared to placebo at all of the doses assessed. There appeared to be a dose response effect with the most effective dose (200 mg) producing a clinically significant 1 hour 38 minute reduction in 'off' time. Corresponding increases in 'on' time that were statistically and clinically significant were seen with both agents; entacapone 1 hour 1 minute, tolcapone 1 hour 55 minutes.</P>
<P>Increasing the duration of effect of the levodopa dose can lead to smaller doses of levodopa being required by patients. The entacapone trials showed that treatment with entacapone resulted in a weighted mean difference of 55 mg/day reduction in levodopa which was statistically significant. The trials of tolcapone showed that treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in levodopa at all the doses assessed. Again there appeared to be a dose response curve with the greatest reduction (156 mg/day) being produced by 100 mg/day tolcapone. The chi-square test for heterogeneity was highly significant for the 200 mg tolcapone dose. There is nothing obvious in the trial designs which could have produced this and it was not seen with the other doses of tolcapone.</P>
<P>The trials also examined whether adjuvant COMT-inhibitor therapy could improve motor impairments and disability. Statistical significant improvements in UPDRS ADL and motor scores were demonstrated in four out of the five entacapone trials in which this was measured. It was not possible to perform meta-analysis of these improvements from the data provided, but it appeared likely that they were of sufficient size to be clinically as well as statistically significant. However improvements in the UPDRS ADL and motor score were seen far less often in the tolcapone trials. Only one out of five studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements at the 200 mg dose.</P>
<P>Thus regarding the comparative efficacy of the two COMT inhibitors, entacapone produced clinically and statistically significant reductions in 'off' time and levodopa dose and improvements in 'on' time. Measures of motor function and activities of daily living were significantly improved in 4 of the 5 studies. Tolcapone produced slightly larger significant reductions in 'off' time and levodopa dose and improvements in 'on' time. However motor function and activities of daily living improved in fewer studies. It would be unwise to draw any conclusions about the relative efficacy of these two COMT inhibitors from this review. Such indirect comparisons from placebo-controlled trials would be prone to error since the agents were not compared head-to-head.</P>
<P>The benefits of COMT inhibitor therapy are produced at the expense of increased adverse events. Some of the adverse events are related to the increased availability of levodopa and it is likely that as soon as the levodopa dose was reduced these symptoms may have improved. As adverse events are reported for the trial as a whole, irrespective of their duration, it is difficult to interpret these results in a clinically useful manner. However the profile of adverse events appears to be similar for both drugs. Both entacapone and tolcapone increased the risk of dyskinesias, nausea and vomiting by similar degrees. Entacapone increased the risk of diarrhoea (Peto odds ratio 2.69) but tolcapone only significantly increased the risk of diarrhoea at the 200 mg dose (Peto odds ratio 2.52). Entacapone increased the risk of constipation and dizziness, whilst tolcapone increased the risk of hallucinations at the 200 mg dose.</P>
<P>Relatively few abnormalities in transaminases were recorded in the tolcapone trials and these appeared to be reversible on drug withdrawal. It was only post-marketing surveillance that identified three cases of fatal hepatic toxicity which led to the withdrawal of tolcapone's product license in some markets and dose limitations in others (<LINK REF="REF-EAEM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAEM 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall entacapone increased the likelihood that participants would withdraw due to adverse events (Peto OR 1.52, P=0.02) or due to all causes (Peto OR 1.40, P=0.04), whilst patients on tolcapone showed no significant increase in withdrawals due to adverse events or due to all causes. However it should be noted that all cause withdrawal rates were only available for two of the six tolcapone trials.</P>
<P>In summary, entacapone produced reductions in 'off' time and levodopa dose accompanied by a meaningful improvement in motor impairments and disability, but at the cost of increased adverse events such as dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and dizziness. Tolcapone produced a slightly larger reduction in 'off' time and levodopa dose which was occasionally accompanied by measurable functional improvements but at the cost of an increased risk of dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and hallucinations.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, tolcapone and entacapone can be used to reduce off time, reduce levodopa dose, and modestly improve motor impairment and disability. This is based on, at best, medium term evidence. However Phase IV surveillance has raised concerns over the safety of tolcapone with regard to hepatic toxicity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We gather that a further study is underway to assess the benefits of tolcapone in patients who have been withdrawn from entacapone. If this presumably non-randomised study shows significantly greater benefits with tolcapone over entacapone then there may be a case for using tolcapone in spite of the risks of hepatic damage. This type of study cannot replace the more rigorous approach of a randomised controlled trial comparing these drugs.</P>
<P>In the future, adjuvant therapy trials in Parkinson's disease should:-</P>
