<P>
<I>
<B>Review question</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review summarises trials evaluating the effects of promoting hand washing on the incidence of diarrhoea among children and adults in day-care centres, schools, communities, or hospitals. After searching for relevant trials up to 27 May 2015, we included 22 randomized controlled trials conducted in both high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These trials enrolled 69,309 children and 148 adults.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>How does hand washing prevent diarrhoea and how might hand washing be promoted</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Diarrhoea causes many deaths in children below five years of age, mostly in LMICs. The organisms causing diarrhoea are transmitted from person to person through food and water contaminated with faeces, or through person-to-person contact. Hand washing after defecation, or after cleaning a baby's bottom, and before preparing and eating food, can therefore reduce the risk of diarrhoea. Hand washing can be promoted through group or individual training on hygiene education, germ-health awareness, use of posters, leaflets, comic books, songs, and drama.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>What this review says</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion at child day-care facilities or schools in HICs probably prevents around 30% of diarrhoea episodes (<I>high quality evidence</I>), and may prevent a similar proportion in schools in LMICs (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Among communities in LMICs hand washing promotion prevents around 28% of diarrhoea episodes (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). In the only hospital-based trial included in this review, hand washing promotion also had important reduction in the mean episodes of diarrhoea (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). This is based on only a single trial with few participants and thus there is need for more trials to confirm this. Effects of hand washing promotion on related hand hygiene behaviour changes improved more in the intervention groups than in the control in all the settings (<I>low to high quality evidence</I>). None of the included trials assessed the effect of handwashing promotion on diarrhoeal-related deaths, all-cause under-five mortality, or the cost-effectiveness of hand washing promotions.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion in HICs and LMICs settings may reduce incidence of diarrhoea by about 30%. However, less is known about how to help people maintain hand washing habits in the longer term.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-07-28 11:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 May 2015); CENTRAL (published in the Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 May 2015); EMBASE (1974 to 27 May 2015); LILACS (1982 to 27 May 2015); PsycINFO (1967 to 27 May 2015); Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (1981 to 27 May 2015); ERIC (1966 to 27 May 2015); SPECTR (2000 to 27 May 2015); Bibliomap (1990 to 27 May 2015); RoRe, The Grey Literature (2002 to 27 May 2015); World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and reference lists of articles up to 27 May 2015. We also contacted researchers and organizations in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-06-29 19:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individually randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs that compared the effects of hand washing interventions on diarrhoea episodes in children and adults with no intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-30 15:05:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We stratified the analyses for child day-care centres or schools, community, and hospital-based settings. Where appropriate, incidence rate ratios (IRR) were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-26 14:01:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 22 RCTs: 12 trials from child day-care centres or schools in mainly high-income countries (54,006 participants), nine community-based trials in LMICs (15,303 participants), and one hospital-based trial among people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (148 participants).</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion (education activities, sometimes with provision of soap) at child day-care facilities or schools prevents around one-third of diarrhoea episodes in high income countries (rate ratio 0.70; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; nine trials, 4664 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>), and may prevent a similar proportion in LMICs but only two trials from urban Egypt and Kenya have evaluated this (rate ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; two trials, 45,380 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Only three trials reported measures of behaviour change and the methods of data collection were susceptible to bias. In one trial from the USA hand washing behaviour was reported to improve; and in the trial from Kenya that provided free soap, hand washing did not increase, but soap use did (data not pooled; three trials, 1845 participants, <I>low</I> <I>quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion among communities in LMICs probably prevents around one-quarter of diarrhoea episodes (rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.83; eight trials, 14,726 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). However, six of these eight trials were from Asian settings, with only single trials from South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In six trials, soap was provided free alongside hand washing education, and the overall average effect size was larger than in the two trials which did not provide soap (soap provided: rate ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; six trials, 11,422 participants; education only: rate ratio: 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.05; two trials, 3304 participants). There was increased hand washing at major prompts (before eating/cooking, after visiting the toilet or cleaning the baby's bottom), and increased compliance to hand hygiene procedure (behavioural outcome) in the intervention groups than the control in community trials (data not pooled: three trials, 3490 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion for the one trial conducted in a hospital among high-risk population showed significant reduction in mean episodes of diarrhoea (1.68 fewer) in the intervention group (Mean difference 1.68, 95% CI 1.93 to 1.43; one trial, 148 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There was increase in hand washing frequency, seven times per day in the intervention group versus three times in the control in this hospital trial (one trial, 148 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We found no trials evaluating or reporting the effects of hand washing promotions on diarrhoea-related deaths, all-cause-under five mortality, or costs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 19:10:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-28 11:28:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-28 11:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diarrhoea is a serious global public health problem, accounting for 1.8 million deaths annually especially among children under five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2013</LINK>). The yearly global diarrhoeal disease burden is estimated at 72.8 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost through incapacitation and premature deaths, mainly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diarrhoea contributes significantly to malnutrition in children through a combination of forced low-nutrient intake, reduced absorption, and increased nutrient excretion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). The malnutrition-infection complex is clearly reinforced during diarrhoea episodes, as poor nutritional status predisposes children to more severe and persistent diarrhoea, impaired growth and development, and higher case fatality rates (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diarrhoeal disease pathogens are usually transmitted through the faecal-oral route (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2000</LINK>). The pathways include ingestion of food and water contaminated by faecal matter, person-to-person contact, or direct contact with infected faeces (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 2012</LINK>). Some trials estimate that over 75% of all diarrhoea cases can be attributed to contaminated food and water (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maxwell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxwell 2012</LINK>). Poor hygiene behaviours and improper handling practices of caregivers are associated with high levels of bacterial contamination of food and water (<LINK REF="REF-Iroegbu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iroegbu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickering-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Behaviours that encourage human contact with faecal matter include: improper disposal of faeces; children defecating on the floor; rags being used to cleanse the child after defecation; and lack of hand washing after defecation, handling faeces (including children's faeces) or cleansing the child's perineum and before handling food by caregivers and children (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 2011</LINK>). In particular, hand contact with ready-to-eat food (that is, food consumed without further washing, cooking, or processing/preparation by the consumer) represents a potentially important mechanism by which diarrhoea-causing pathogens contaminate food and water (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK>). In addition, flies may serve as vectors of diarrhoea-causing pathogens to humans. Thus, consumption of food exposed to flies is associated with high risk of diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Marino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Household economic status is significantly associated with diarrhoea prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Woldemicael-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woldemicael 2001</LINK>), especially in low-income countries. Households may lack basic infrastructure for proper hygiene practices, such as facilities for proper disposal of excreta. In addition, even where available, these may not be adapted for children's use (<LINK REF="REF-Tumwine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tumwine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK>). This often leads to indiscriminate defecation in and around the premises, and to increased risk of excreta handling by mothers, caregivers, and children (<LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 2001</LINK>). A trial in Eritrea found that the availability of a toilet facility in households was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Woldemicael-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woldemicael 2001</LINK>). The same trial also found associations between the number of children living in the house and diarrhoea morbidity. In some cultures children's faeces are regarded as innocuous. For this reason adults may not wash their hands after handling children's faeces and may cleanse a child with their bare hands (<LINK REF="REF-Traore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traore 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2000</LINK>). However, evidence suggests that children's faeces are equally as hazardous as adult faeces and may contain even higher concentrations of pathogens than those of adults due to the children's increased interactions with contaminated materials in their surroundings (<LINK REF="REF-Oketcho-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oketcho 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Hygiene promotion interventions constitute one of a number of strategies identified by World Health Organization (WHO) for control of diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK>). These constitute a range of activities aimed at encouraging individuals and communities to adopt safer practices within domestic and community settings to prevent hygiene-related diseases that lead to diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-WELL-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WELL 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehiri 2001</LINK>); hand washing is one such intervention. The practice of hand washing and the factors that influence hand washing behaviour among individuals in communities are complex (<LINK REF="REF-Whitby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitby 2007</LINK>); for example, washing hands with water only or with soap may be influenced by both knowledge of best practice and availability of water and soap (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2011</LINK>). Also, hand washing may require infrastructural, cultural, and behavioural changes, which take time to develop, as well as substantial resources (for example, trained personnel, community organization, provision of water supply and soap) (<LINK REF="REF-Luby-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luby 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK>). Consideration of the wide applicability and sustainability of hygiene interventions have recently come under critical review (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2006-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2006 PAK</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ejemot_x002d_Nwadiaro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejemot-Nwadiaro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huis 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madhu 2012</LINK>). For example, maintenance of the new hand washing behaviours that result from hand washing promotional interventions is vital in maximizing the associated potential health benefits. Apart from the challenges of sustaining new behaviour (hand washing) among the target communities, cost has been identified as a major factor that limits the sustainability of hand hygiene behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Langford-2007-NPL" TYPE="STUDY">Langford 2007 NPL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartinger-2010-PER" TYPE="STUDY">Hartinger 2010 PER</LINK>). For example, to sustain the health benefits of newly acquired hand washing behaviours, it is also important that individuals and communities have access to resources that support hand washing, including water and soap. Thus, lack of access to hand washing resources may limit the potential impact of hand washing on health particularly for low-income households and communities.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-29 22:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hand washing aims to decontaminate the hands and prevent cross transmission of diarrhoeal-causing pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Ehiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehiri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurjeet-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurjeet 2013</LINK>). Hand washing promotion employs direct approaches such as training and educating individuals or group of individuals about hygiene, diarrhoea transmission, the relationship between germs and health, demonstrating this relationship through leaflets, posters, drama, and songs (<LINK REF="REF-Whitby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitby 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2011</LINK>). Washing hands with soap and water removes pathogens mechanically and may also chemically kill contaminating and colonizing flora, making hand washing more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Hugonnet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugonnet 2000</LINK>). Also washing hands with soap under running water or large quantities of water with vigorous rubbing was found to be more effective than several members of a household dipping their hands into the same bowl of water (often without soap) (<LINK REF="REF-Luby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luby 2005</LINK>), which is a common practice in many low-income countries, especially before household meals (<LINK REF="REF-Ehiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehiri 2001</LINK>). This may contribute to, rather than prevent, food contamination as pathogens present on contaminated hands of household members can be transferred to those who subsequently dip their hands in the same bowl of water (<LINK REF="REF-Pr_x00fc_ss-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prüss 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-28 11:28:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hand washing is a viable intervention in the control of diarrhoeal diseases. It is listed in the <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO 2009</LINK> seven-point plan for comprehensive control of diarrhoea. Hand washing requires infrastructural, cultural, and behavioural changes that take time and substantial resources to develop (<LINK REF="REF-Cave-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cave 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeager-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeager 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2001b</LINK>). Given that resources spent on interventions to promote hand washing could be invested on other equally important public health programmes, it is important to ascertain that hand washing promotion is an efficient use of scarce health resources. In 2008, we published a review that assessed the broader question of the effectiveness of hand washing with soap in preventing diarrhoea as against other interventions such as provision of water, improvement of water quality (treatment of water), amongst randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Ejemot_x002d_Nwadiaro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejemot-Nwadiaro 2008</LINK>). A review by <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2003</LINK>, which examined the effectiveness of hand washing with soap in community-based trials, estimated that hand washing could reduce diarrhoea risk by up to 47%. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2005</LINK> examined a range of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions in LMICs, and estimated that hygiene interventions reduced diarrhoea incidence by 44%. However, both reviews included non-randomized trials. <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2003</LINK> included cross-sectional trials which have inherent limitations with regard to establishment of causal relationships. <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2005</LINK> presented evidence of publication bias in included trials. In this Cochrane Review, we assessed whether the estimate of effect observed only in RCTs is of similar magnitude to those seen in previous reviews and the applicability of hand washing interventions in reducing diarrhoeal diseases across wide population groups. We also included both institution-based and community-based trials in countries of any income level.</P>

<P>Three review authors (RIE, JC, and DA) independently screened titles and abstracts of relevant articles to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the review.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-07-28 11:28:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors (RIE, DA, and JC) independently extracted data on methods, types of participants, interventions, and outcomes from the selected trials using a standardized data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion and consensus among review authors. We requested unpublished data and additional information from published trials from relevant individuals, groups, and organizations.</P>
<P>We extracted the year of completion of the trial rather than the year of publication for identification of included trials. When such data were not reported we used the year of publication. In addition, we used a three-letter international code of the country were the trial was conducted. This was to give a clear time frame for the Cochrane Review (1977 to 2013). We extracted data on each trial site, including any measures of availability of water, soap, and literacy level of the communities. Where data were available, we extracted the socioeconomic status of trial participants since resources for effective hand washing (for example, running water and soap) may be more accessible to higher income households. We carefully summarized details of the intervention including: type of promotional activity, whether soap and water provision was part of the intervention, method of hand washing promoted (washing in a bowl or under running water), and procedure for hand washing.</P>
<P>We had intended to analyse episodes of diarrhoea as a dichotomous outcome, but the data reported by the trials did not permit this type of analysis. We analysed the outcome as count data, when either the incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or the number of episodes of diarrhoea and the person-time at risk was reported; or as continuous data when the mean number of diarrhoea episodes and standard deviation (SD) were presented.</P>
<P>For individually RCTs, when continuous outcomes data were summarized as arithmetic means, we extracted the arithmetic means, SDs, and numbers of participants for the treatment and control groups. For count (rate) outcome data we extracted the number of episodes, the number of person-years at risk, and the number of participants for each intervention group, or we extracted a rate ratio and measure of variation (for example, CI) directly from the publication.</P>
<P>Cluster-RCTs require the use of different data extraction methods and analysis methods because trials with a cluster design require more complex analysis than trials that randomized individuals. Observations on participants in the same cluster tend to be correlated; therefore the intra-cluster variation must be accounted for during the analysis of the trial. If this correlation is ignored in the analysis and the same techniques are employed as for individually RCTs the resulting measure of effect remains a valid estimate, but the associated variance of the estimate will be underestimated leading to unduly narrow CIs. For meta-analysis this means that trials analysed without allowing for this design effect will receive too much weight.</P>
<P>For the cluster-RCTs, we extracted information on the number of clusters, average size of clusters, unit of randomization, whether the trials adjusted for clustering, and the statistical method used to analyse cluster trials. When a trial's analysis had adjusted for clustering, we extracted the point estimate and 95% CI. For count data we extracted the incidence rate ratio. If a trial had not adjusted for clustering, we extracted the same data as for the individually RCTs.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-26 09:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (RIE and DA) independently assessed the risk of bias in included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the risk of bias across the following domains: randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. We classified our judgements as 'high', 'unclear' or 'low' risk of bias using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the blinding domain we acknowledged that double blinding is not possible in trials of hand washing interventions since there is no obvious placebo. However, outcome assessors could be blinded, and we assessed whether or not this had occurred. It is also difficult to assess losses to follow-up (incomplete outcome data) in open cluster-RCTs. Some adults and children may leave the trial, but others are born or enter the trial during the follow-up period; hence participant numbers are in constant flux. Inclusion of all randomized participants in the analysis is thus most clearly represented as the person-time at risk accrued as a percentage of maximum possible person-time at risk in each trial arm. Therefore, we reported on this measure and also on any loss to follow-up of both clusters and participants, and assessed this as low risk if at least 90%. We also assessed whether baseline characteristics were comparable across the intervention groups and assessed whether data was collected at similar time points for the intervention and control sites with a view to identifying selective reporting and other possible biases. The details are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and interpret our findings.

We then proceeded to downgrade the quality of evidence (if necessary) for each outcome across the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias for each trial that contributed to the outcome. We downgraded the evidence for each outcome by one level (for serious limitations), two levels (for very serious limitations), or left it at 'no limitations' when we found no reason to downgrade.</P>
<P>We included the pre-specified outcomes for the three independent settings in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>.</P>

Due to the limited number of trials in each setting we were unable to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in depth.

<P>We analysed the data using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan)</LINK> and presented all results with 95% CIs. We stratified the analysis into three categories of settings &#8211; child day-care centres and school-based interventions (day-care centres or primary schools), community-based interventions, and intervention in people at high risk of diarrhoea (people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)).

<P>For count outcomes, we pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan)</LINK> using the generic inverse variance method with the random-effects model. We used standard techniques for calculating standard errors from 95% CIs (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). When the outcomes and methods of measuring outcomes were too variable to make meta-analysis meaningful (for changes in hand washing behaviour) we tabulated the results. One trial performed child and site-level analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Haggerty-1988-COD" TYPE="STUDY">Haggerty 1988 COD</LINK>); the 95% CIs were not provided for the site-level analysis. We therefore estimated the denominator from the number of children by trial arm by assuming that all those who had remained in the trial for at least nine weeks had a total of 12 weeks of follow-up. The numerator (average number of episodes per child) was provided at the cluster level. We classified this trial as cluster adjusted. One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2006-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2006 PAK</LINK>, presented mean longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea without presenting data on incidence of diarrhoea and hence we could not include it in the meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-RCTs that did not adjust for clustering</HEADING>
<P>For trials that did not report on or were unclear on the method used to adjust for clustering, we either extracted information on the rate ratio and unadjusted 95% CI or, wherever possible, estimated the unadjusted rate ratios and 95% CIs from the total number of diarrhoea episodes and person-time at risk in each trial arm. Where data on person-time at risk were not directly provided by the trial authors, we estimated this as accurately as possible from the follow-up duration multiplied by the total number of children as the denominator for both intervention and control groups respectively. The measures of effect and CIs are presented in tables. One trial adjusted for clustering by comparing the mean incidence rate of intervention and non-intervention classrooms (<LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>), but only a cluster-adjusted 95% CIs for a different outcome (excess mean episodes) and not a rate ratio was presented. We took the cluster-adjusted estimate of the numerator (the mean incidence rate across the clusters) from the published data and estimated the person-time at risk crudely by multiplying the number of contacts every two weeks by the number of children and assuming this was equally distributed between the intervention and control groups. We classified this trial as not having adjusted for clustering</P>
<P>For all trials that did not adjust for clustering, we attempted to make an approximate adjustment using estimates of the ICC from one of the trials that did adjust for clustering and reported this statistic. Only two trials reported this statistic: one community-based trial, <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2003b-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2003b PAK</LINK>, and one trial in a child day-care centre, <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>. We assumed that these ICC estimates could be generalized to other community-based and child day-care centre or school-based trials respectively. We extracted the number of children and number of clusters from each unadjusted trial to estimate the average cluster size. We then followed standard methods (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to estimate the design effect for each trial and multiplied the standard error for each trial by the square root of this design effect. This approximate adjustment increases the standard error (and hence width of CIs for the unadjusted trials) and appropriately reduces the weight given to such trial in the meta-analysis. We performed meta-analyses by pooling the estimates of the cluster adjusted and approximately adjusted trials together.</P>

<P>All 12 trials in this group were randomized by cluster using primary schools (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK>), day-care centres (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-1984-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 1984 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1990-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1990 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999-DEN" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999 DEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zomer-2012-NED" TYPE="STUDY">Zomer 2012 NED</LINK> ), or classrooms in day-care centres (<LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>) as the unit of randomization.

The others trials were performed in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>), Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999-DEN" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999 DEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zomer-2012-NED" TYPE="STUDY">Zomer 2012 NED</LINK>), and North America (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-1984-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 1984 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1990-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1990 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK>), where resources and materials for hand washing were relatively available and accessible.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All trials used multiple hygiene interventions, except <LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK> which used only a hand washing intervention. Though <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK> was a three-arm trial that investigated hand sanitizer and hand washing with soap, we only considered the arm of hand washing with soap in this Cochrane Review, as such it is categorized as a hand washing only intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK> assessed the impact of provision of hand washing and diapering equipment on incidence and duration of infectious illness (including diarrhoea) in both children and staff. We have described the interventions in more detail in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>All but one of the included trials in child day-care centres or schools institution-based trials had intervention and control arms (monitoring only). <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> had three arms for the standard intervention, expanded intervention (which included the standard intervention and peer-monitoring of hand-washing), and control. It is important to note that the control group in most cases received quite frequent monitoring (estimating diarrhoea illness episodes on typically two-weekly basis). This monitoring may itself have influenced hand washing behaviour. The <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK> trial attempted to tease out the effects of the intervention alone from 'monitoring'. The 'monitoring' effect in this trial was estimated as the difference in diarrhoea incidence rates within each arm over one year of the trial (September 1996 to November 1997). The crude effectiveness of intervention was estimated as the difference between the monitoring effect in the intervention group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Twelve trials including 54,006 children met the inclusion criteria. Seven trials included children aged less than three years, one trial was in children under six years (<LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999-DEN" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999 DEN</LINK>), and one trial was with children aged less than seven years (<LINK REF="STD-Butz-1990-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1990 USA</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> involved children in the first grade at school in China; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK> included children in government elementary schools in Cairo, Egypt; and <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK> involved children aged between five to 10 years in primary schools in Nairobi, Kenya. Hand washing behavioural changes and changes in knowledge, attitude, and belief on hygiene were assessed in the day-care providers (number not strictly reported) and children, while the primary outcome measures were assessed in the children.</P>
<P>The number of clusters ranged from four (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>) to 87 (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>). Primary outcome measures were assessed across 278 day-care centres and 151 schools. Participants were exposed to mainly small and large group training sessions on hygiene education and germs-health theory, that employed multiple promotional techniques (for example, audio and video tapes, pamphlets, practical demonstrations, drama, posters, songs, games, or peer monitoring). <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK> employed the 'Keep-it-clean' module in training caregivers to standardise the interventions across the trial arms. The aim was to provide education about personal hygiene, diarrhoea transmission, treatment, and prevention, and the importance of techniques for hand washing. Intervention and control groups were generally comparable regarding important characteristics at baseline (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All included trials measured the primary outcome, episodes of diarrhoea. Three trials reported proportion of people washing their hands and or changes in knowledge, attitude, and beliefs about hand washing (<LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK>). No trials reported diarrhoea-related deaths, all-cause-under five mortality or cost-effectiveness data. However, <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK> reported that the cost of purchasing and installing one unit of the hand washing and diapering equipment was quite exorbitant at USD10,385 (USD7500 for the equipment and the rest for installation per classroom). Follow-up periods ranged from two to 12 months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adjustment for clustering</HEADING>
<P>Five trials did not appear to have accounted for clustering in the analysis for any outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-1984-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 1984 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1990-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1990 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999-DEN" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999 DEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK> adjusted for clustering by comparing the mean incidence rate of intervention and non-intervention classrooms, but only a cluster adjusted 95% CI for a difference outcome (excess mean episodes) and not a rate ratio was presented. <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK> reported controlling for clustering by estimating a random effect for the centres, but this does not seem to have been reflected in the results. In the other five cluster-adjusted trials, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> presented only the school level analysis (mean illness and absence rates by school); <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK> adjusted for clustering using a Bayesian hierarchical model, while <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zomer-2012-NED" TYPE="STUDY">Zomer 2012 NED</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK> estimated robust standard errors in a Poisson regression model.</P>

These trials were conducted in LMICs in Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Haggerty-1988-COD" TYPE="STUDY">Haggerty 1988 COD</LINK>), Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1985-MMR" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1985 MMR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanton-1985-BGD" TYPE="STUDY">Stanton 1985 BGD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2003a-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2003a PAK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2003b-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2003b PAK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2006-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2006 PAK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langford-2007-NPL" TYPE="STUDY">Langford 2007 NPL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2008-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2008 IND</LINK>), and South America (<LINK REF="STD-Hartinger-2010-PER" TYPE="STUDY">Hartinger 2010 PER</LINK>).</P>

The primary outcome measure (incidence of diarrhoea) was assessed in each of these categories with their corresponding control groups except for the adults reported as the 'whole family'. In this Cochrane Review we considered results from only the target group as the first three categories had similar effect size. Hand washing behavioural changes and changes in knowledge, attitude, and belief on hygiene were assessed in the mothers (number not strictly reported), while the primary outcome measures were assessed in the children.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Child day-care centres or school based trials</HEADING>
<P>Five of the 12 trials used an adequate method to generate the allocation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zomer-2012-NED" TYPE="STUDY">Zomer 2012 NED</LINK>); the method was unclear in the others. The method used to conceal allocation was unclear in all trials. In cluster-RCTs, lack of concealment of allocation is not considered a major risk of bias since all clusters are usually randomized at the same time (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.3.2).</P>
<P>Three trials reported blinding of the outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-1984-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 1984 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>); the rest were open trials. It was difficult to assess the number of randomized participants included in the analysis as this was reported at different levels (cluster, child, person time-at-risk). However, all trials were able to account for the number of randomized clusters included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Seven trials reported adequate comparability between the intervention and control groups with respect to diarrhoea incidence and sociodemographic characteristics (including mean total enrolment, percentage of drop outs, sex, age, and race composition of children enrolled, diapering, and toilet facilities) at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1977-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1977 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-1984-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 1984 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1990-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1990 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999-DEN" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999 DEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK>). Investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> were forced to over- or under-sample certain regions to obtain more 'control' schools after the original control schools were sent intervention packs by mistake and thus excluded. This trial reported small differences in household sanitation and piped water at baseline, but no differences between schools in number of students, class size, or hygiene infrastructure. Comparability at baseline was unclear in the two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1989-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1989 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK>), while it was considered inadequate in two trials; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-2003-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 2003 USA</LINK> reported baseline differences in total number of children and boys in favour of the intervention which they believed may have influenced the outcome measure and <LINK REF="STD-Zomer-2012-NED" TYPE="STUDY">Zomer 2012 NED</LINK> acknowledged baseline imbalance in crude incidence diarrhoeal episodes per child-year of 3.0 for intervention versus 5.1 for the control but they applied statistical adjustments for this baseline characteristic.

<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2007-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2007 USA</LINK> did not clearly report the method of randomization or allocation concealment and did not use blinding. All 148 randomized participants were followed for the trial's one-year duration. Participants were similar at the start of the trial in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, hand washing episodes per day, CD4 count, HIV load, and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. The results were presented as a continuous outcome only (mean and SD of number of diarrhoea episodes in each arm over the year). This should be viewed with caution as it is likely that the distribution of diarrhoea episodes may be highly skewed (the mean of 1.24 and SD of 0.9 episodes in the intervention arm imply a non-normal distribution of diarrhoea episodes). If so, the mean may not be the most appropriate measure of the 'average number' of episodes per participant. The trial reported collecting data at the same period for intervention and control groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1. Incidence of diarrhoea</HEADING>
<P>Overall, hand washing promotion reduced diarrhoea episodes by about a third (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; 11 trials, 50,044 children (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> not included in analysis); <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Most data were from high income countries (IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; nine trials, 4664 participants; <I>high quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), with only two trials from LMICs (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; two trials, 45,380 participants; <I>low quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials showed a benefit from the intervention, except for <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> which showed no difference between each arm and for which it was not possible to calculate a rate ratio (the median episodes of diarrhoea were 0 per 100 student-weeks in the control group, standard intervention group, and expanded intervention) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996 AUS</LINK> showed greater risk reduction than other trials (IRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.69; one trial, 558 participants), possibly due to a more specific technique of hand washing used (an approximate "count to 10" to wash and "count to 10" to rinse).</P>
<P>All participants were monitored at least every two weeks to collect data on diarrhoea episodes. This monitoring itself may have helped to improve compliance with hand washing. Only <LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1997-CAN" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1997 CAN</LINK> attempted to investigate this effect by assessing rates in both groups compared to the pre-intervention period. They found that monitoring alone appeared to reduce the incidence of diarrhoea (IRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.97; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>), and that the intervention effect did not appear to have any benefits over and above this monitoring effect when adjusted for age and gender (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>) or when adjusted for age, gender, season, and baseline incidence rate in each cluster (IRR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). However, monitoring was particularly frequent (daily) in this trial. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK> trial among first grade students in schools in China, monitoring may have been less intensive as in-class monitoring was carried out one day a week by teachers; reasons for absenteeism were noted when recorded. As the trial was school-based, no illness information was collected during weekends or school holidays. This design reduced the burden of data collection of teachers, but it may also have reduced the ability of the trial to detect differences in the incidence of diarrhoea between each trial arm.</P>

We have included eight additional trials in this Cochrane Review update, giving a total of 22 included trials.

The other trials had primary interventions.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-30 18:21:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hand washing promotion at child day-care facilities or schools prevents around one-third of diarrhoea episodes in high income countries (<I>high</I> <I>quality evidence</I>). It may prevent a similar proportion in LMICs but only two trials from urban Egypt and Kenya have evaluated this (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Hand washing promotion among communities in LMICs probably prevents around one-quarter of diarrhoea episodes (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). However, six of these eight trials were from Asian settings, with only single trials from South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In six trials soap was provided free alongside education and behavioural change interventions. The overall effect size was larger than in the two trials that did not provide soap. The influence of this on the intervention effect estimate is not well understood.</P>
<P>The effect of hand washing promotion in a hospital-based setting among high-risk population had significant reduction in mean episodes of diarrhoea that favoured intervention group (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). This is only from one trial.</P>
<P>The effect of the intervention on hand hygiene related behavioural outcome in all settings showed increase in proportion of hand washing or hand hygiene compliance at essential junctures (before eating/cooking and after visiting the toilet or cleaning the baby's bottom) favouring the intervention groups (unpooled data; reflecting a range of <I>low to high quality evidence).</I>
</P>
<P>We found no trials evaluating or reporting the effects of hand washing interventions on diarrhoea-related deaths, all-cause-under five mortality, or costs.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-30 09:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe we identified all RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We further categorised the included trials into three distinct settings in this Cochrane Review: child day-care centres or schools, community, and hospital. Although there were only a few trials included in each category, evidence favours hand washing intervention in preventing diarrhoea in all the settings. This suggests that the intervention exhibits population-wide health gains. However, most included trials in the institution subcategory were from childcare settings in high-income countries. Thus, we are not confident that this finding can be applied to schools in LMIC settings or alternative institutions. Also, only one hospital-based trial met the inclusion criteria, so evidence from this setting was limited.</P>
<P>We are unsure of the effect of this intervention in populations with participants above five years of age and adults, as 95% of the participants in which the primary outcome was measured were below five years of age. One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK>, measured the primary outcome in participants with a mean age of eight years but did not stratify the results by age. <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2008-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2008 IND</LINK> measured the primary outcome in participants of various ages (target children aged five years, children below five years of age, children aged between six to 15 years and adults) and stratified results by these independent subgroups and reported effect sizes, with no significant trend observed. Therefore the effect of the intervention may not be generalizable to all age groups.</P>
<P>All included trials were relatively small-sized and of short follow-up duration including intensive monitoring and they demonstrated significant reduction in the risk of diarrhoea after hand hygiene intervention. However, in one relatively large trial, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004 CHN</LINK>, and one with longer follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2006-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2006 PAK</LINK>, there were no apparent benefits as no significant differences between the incidence or longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea was found. Therefore, we are unclear if the reductions in incidence of diarrhoea would be maintained if these trials had been larger and conducted over a longer time period.</P>
<P>The effect size was lower in child day-care centres or school-based trials that attempted blinding outcome assessors than in trials that did not (26% versus 33% reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea respectively). The same trend was observed for community-based trials, with 18% reduction for trials that attempted blinding of outcome assessors and 35% reduction for trials that did not attempt blinding. This suggests a possible introduction of bias in trials that did not attempt blinding. However, there were too few trials in each category to make strong conclusions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-26 09:59:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>). In general, the evidence that hand washing reduces the incidence of diarrhoea in both child day-care centres in high-income countries and community settings in LMICs is considered high quality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Most trials were at high or unclear risk of detection or reporting bias due to no description of blinding of outcome assessors. However, this made negligible differences in our findings as restriction of the analysis to just the blinded trials found a slightly smaller but statistically significant effect size. In addition, the trials' results showed a lot of statistical heterogeneity. However, these inconsistencies did not affect the quality of evidence in these settings since all trials favoured the intervention though with varying effect size. We are therefore confident in the estimate of effect and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate.</P>
<P>For the trials conducted in schools in LMICs, we considered the quality of evidence to be low due to indirectness as this limits our confidence in the effect estimate. The two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-2008-EGY" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 2008 EGY</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK>, were conducted under experimentally controlled situations. Though they showed benefits in favour of the intervention groups, we are unsure if these benefits would be maintained if trials are replicated in a less controlled situations and in other settings.</P>
<P>Quality of evidence from unpooled data for the behavioural outcomes ranged from low to high in all the settings. These should be interpreted with caution as there were too few trials in each setting and method of assessment were too varied to make strong statements. The benefit of adopting an explicit behavioral change model is still unclear; this may influence the maintenance and sustainability of hand hygiene behaviour, as <LINK REF="REF-Whitby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitby 2007</LINK> has opined that the strongest determinant of hand washing behaviour may be its habituation.The quality of evidence regarding the other outcomes (diarrhoea related deaths, all-cause-under five mortality, and cost-effectiveness) were not determined due to paucity of included trials providing data on which to make such judgements. Thus, further research is necessary to provide a basis for assessment of evidence to these factors critical to hand washing intervention in preventing diarrhoea.</P>

<P>The magnitude of intervention effect (&#8771; 30%) in both child day-care centres or schools and community settings we observed in this Cochrane Review did not differ significantly from that of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ejemot_x002d_Nwadiaro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejemot-Nwadiaro 2008</LINK>). The effect size however remains lower in magnitude than previous reviews of hand washing interventions; 47% (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2003</LINK>); and about 44% in <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2005</LINK> reviews.

Both reviews considered only hand hygiene interventions conducted in LMICs. In this Cochrane Review we included only RCTs and mixed settings (child day-care centres or schools, community, and hospital based trials conducted in both developing and developed countries). However, they are all in agreement that hand hygiene interventions are effective in reducing diarrhoeal diseases.</P>

<P>Hand washing promotion leads to reduction in diarrhoea episodes in both child day-care centres in high-income countries and among communities living in LMICs by about 30%. The challenge is to find ways of encouraging people to maintain hand washing habits in the longer term.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-26 10:02:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this Cochrane Review show that further research to determine the efficacy of hand washing intervention in preventing diarrhoea will be unnecessary in child day-care centres in high-income countries and in communities in LMICs, although only one trial was conducted in Africa.</P>
<P>More trials conducted in child day-care centres or schools in LMICs are needed to enhance our ability to generalize the intervention effects. The need to conduct research that is of longer follow-up duration and uses a structured method of assessing the primary outcome is pertinent, since it has been observed that arbitrary use of methods may have significant effect on precision of estimates. Outcome assessors should be blinded so as to reduce the bias in estimates of effect size.</P>
<P>Evidence of hand washing on diarrhoea incidence in hospital based settings is still limited as we only found one trial that met the inclusion criteria. Therefore, further research in this area would be warranted.</P>

<P>We have introduced the term 'promotion' into the title of this Cochrane Review update. We added methods for assessing blinding and changed our primary outcome measure in the protocol from the relative risk of at least one diarrhoea episode to the incidence rate ratio for diarrhoea episodes. We pooled rate ratios in our analyses rather than relative risks since all trials presented diarrhoea as episodes, and removed "or standard hygiene promotion" as a control because it is included in the "no hand washing promotion" control group. We added all-cause-under five mortality and cost-effectiveness as secondary outcome measures for this review update. We used <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK> to assess the quality of the evidence. In addition, we have included 'Summary of findings' tables in this update. Henry Ejere, a co-author on the protocol, did not participate in preparation of the original review nor this review update. Dachi Arikpo joined as a co-author in this review update.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>"Two significant differences between the 2 trial groups were noted. The total number of children and the number of boys were larger in the intervention classrooms. These differences may have reduced the overall effect of the intervention, because number of children per classroom is a risk factor, and boys tend to stay in diapers longer. In addition, control centres were working hard to get their perceived reward (the free equipment that they were promised at the end of the trial). These 3 factors should have reduced the difference in outcomes between the intervention and control groups, suggesting that the significant differences in illnesses and absences that were found favouring the intervention group are all the more impressive".</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>The median incidence of diarrhoea in the control groups was four episodes per 100 children per year.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious risk of bias: Most trials are at high or unclear risk of detection or reporting bias due to no description of blinding of outcome assessors. Restriction of the analysis to just the blinded trials finds a slightly smaller effect size but the result remains statistically significant. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious inconsistency: Although statistical heterogeneity was high, this heterogeneity was related to the size of the effect not the direction of effect. The individual effect sizes in trials ranged from an 10% relative reduction in diarrhoea to a 50% reduction.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious indirectness: These nine trials were conducted in day-care centres/schools in high income countries (USA, Denmark, Australia, Netherlands and Canada).<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>No serious imprecision: The result is statistically significant and the meta-analysis adequately powered to detect this result.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>The incidence of diarrhoea in the control group in the trial from Egypt was 22 per 100 children per year. The incidence in the control group in the Kenya trial was not stated.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>No serious inconsistency: While both trials found reductions in diarrhoea incidence the reduction was only statistically significant in the trials from Egypt. However, we did not downgrade.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for serious indirectness: Only one trial was conducted in a low-income country (<LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2013-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2013 KEN</LINK>). This trial from an urban slum in Nairobi did not find a statistically significant benefit on diarrhoea incidence.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: In the three trials, the observers themselves could not have been blinded and may have influenced the outcome simply by being present.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: These three trials are from day care-centres in the Netherlands and USA and schools in an urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. Further trials from different settings are needed to confirm this result can be generalized.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>The trials from Netherlands and USA found large and statistically significant improvements in staff hand washing behaviour or hand hygiene compliance. The trial from Kenya found no improvement in hand washing, but large and statistically significant improvements in the use of soap.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>The median incidence of diarrhoea in the control groups was 3 episodes per 100 children per year.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious risk of bias: Most trials are at high or unclear risk of detection or reporting bias due to no description of blinding of outcome assessors. Restriction of the analysis to just the blinded trials finds a slightly smaller effect size but the result remains statistically significant. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious inconsistency: Although statistical heterogeneity was high, this heterogeneity was related to the size of the effect not the direction of effect. The individual effect sizes in trials ranged from an 6% relative reduction in diarrhoea to a 30% reduction.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: These eight trials were conducted in LMICs (the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Peru, India and Nepal).<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>No serious imprecision: The result is statistically significant and the meta-analysis adequately powered to detect this result.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>No serious risk of bias: Most trials are at high or unclear risk of detection or reporting bias due to no description of blinding of outcome assessors. Restriction of the analysis to just the blinded trials finds a slightly smaller effect size but the result remains statistically significant. Not downgraded. However this is limited to three trials in low-income countries. Further trials from other income settings are needed to confirm if this result can be generalized.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>No serious inconsistency: All the included trials found reductions in diarrhoea incidence.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>No serious indirectness: The three trials were conducted in low-income communities/countries (Nepal, low-income urban communities in Mumbai, India and Bangladesh). The trials found statistically significant benefit on diarrhoea incidence.<BR/>

<P>I have read the interesting Cochrane Review "Hand washing for preventing diarrhoea" conducted by you and your colleagues, published in The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 3. I would like to take the liberty to comment on the search strategies shown in Table 1:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Search set 8 and 9 are identical for MEDLINE and EMBASE &#8211; I assume one of them should be upper case to indicate MeSH/EMTREE, or? (The correct MeSH/EMTREE is DIARRHEA, not DIARRHOEA &#8211; but either maps to the correct term, and thus gives the same result)</LI>
<LI>I suggest you include handwashing$, diarrhoea$ and diarrhea$ as free text terms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>From the attached search sets it appears that you may have missed 98 and 61 potentially relevant records in MEDLINE and EMBASE respectively. Of course, this does not mean that you have not identified all relevant and available trials but it still poses a risk which I suggest you address in your next update of the review. How I searched MEDLINE and EMBASE, via Ovid (other databases were not searched):</P>
<P>Set 1-11: Identical to the search shown in Table 1 (I assumed set 9 should be in upper case)</P>
<P>Set 12-16: I added handwashing$ as free text term and show how many records are missed (set 16: records published before 2008)</P>
<P>Set 17-22: Same as above, but added diarrhoea$ and diarrhea$ to the search (set 22: records published before 2008)</P>
<P>Also, it would be helpful to know how many records your retrieved in your initial searches, how many were excluded due to lack of relevance, methodological flaws etc., i.e. presented in a flowchart.</P>
<P>Best regards,</P>
<P>Ole Nørgaard</P>

We do not believe that we have missed any relevant records, but as this review is due to be updated, we will investigate this further during the updating process. With regard to presenting the results in a flowchart, PRISMA diagrams were not expected in Cochrane Reviews at the time this review was initially produced. This will again be dealt with during the updating process.</P>

We have incorporated his suggestions appropriately into this review update.</P>
