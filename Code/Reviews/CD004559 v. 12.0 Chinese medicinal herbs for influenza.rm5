<P>In this 2007 updated review we added "to assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicinal herbs in preventing cases of influenza" in the Objectives section because Chinese medicinal herbs are also commonly used for preventing influenza during epidemic periods.<BR/>We excluded quasi-RCTs. We interviewed the trial authors and excluded any supposed RCTs which we discovered were in fact not randomised controlled trials.<BR/>We excluded comparisons of one herbal medicine with another herbal medicine as we were uncertain of the control herb's efficacy.<BR/>Accordingly, the references to studies were changed and new trials were found.<BR/>We also changed the types of outcome measures because we added prophylactic studies and continuous data for analyses. As a result, the 'Description of studies', 'Risk of bias in included studies', 'Results' and 'Discussion' sections were amended.</P>

<P>Influenza is a viral respiratory infection that causes an acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache and cough, and can result in high morbidity and mortality rates during an epidemic. Annual epidemics are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe influenza and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths worldwide. Currently, annual vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing influenza, and four influenza antiviral agents (amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir) have been approved for treatment of influenza. However, high levels of drug resistance have been recorded. Many Chinese medicinal herbs are used to treat and prevent this condition.</P>
<P>This updated review assessed the therapeutic effects and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs as an alternative and adjunctive therapy to other commonly used drugs for influenza. Eighteen studies involving 2521 participants were included in the review. 'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and aiding recovery in one study (in which adverse reactions were mentioned in the amantadine group although no data were reported). There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin in treating influenza, nor in the occurrence of adverse reactions. The remaining 17 Chinese herbal trials showed a similar effect to antiviral drugs in preventing or treating influenza. However, since these included studies were of poor quality, the evidence does not support or reject the use of any Chinese herbal preparations for influenza. High-quality trials are required.</P>

'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and speeding recovery in one study (in which adverse reactions were mentioned in the amantadine group although no data were reported).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-18 11:20:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by a virus from the <I>Orthomyxoviridae</I> family, of which three serotypes are known (A, B and C). Influenza causes an acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache and cough. Uncomplicated influenza generally resolves over a two to five-day period. However, in a significant minority, symptoms of weakness and malaise may persist for several weeks, particularly in the elderly. Complications of influenza include otitis media, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease, croup and bronchiolitis. Additionally, influenza can cause a range of non-respiratory complications including febrile convulsions, Reyes's syndrome and myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Wiselka-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiselka 1994</LINK>). The influenza virus is transmitted primarily via virus-laden large droplets from sneezing, coughing or talking. Transmission may also occur by direct (for example, person-to-person) or indirect (person-to-fomite-to person) contact (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Influenza virus types (A, B or C) are based on antigenic characteristics of the nucleoproteins and matrix protein antigens. However, the influenza virus genome is segmented and there is a high frequency of re-arrangements of the genes (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alves-Galv_x00e3_o-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alves Galvão 2012</LINK>). A major factor in determining the severity and spread of influenza outbreaks is the level of immunity present in the population at risk. When an antigenically new influenza virus emerges in a community where few or no antibodies are present, extensive outbreaks may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Claas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1999</LINK>). Annual epidemics are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe influenza and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003a</LINK>). The outbreak in humans of an H5N1 avian influenza virus in Hong Kong in 1997 has increased awareness of our vulnerability to a global pandemic. Since late 2003 the accelerated geographical spread of influenza A (H5N1) among birds has heightened concerns. Up until December 2012, 610 confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A (H5N1) and 360 death in 15 countries has been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 09:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Annual vaccination is recommended as the primary strategy for preventing influenza (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>). Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for controlling influenza symptoms may be recommended and antiviral medications can be prescribed. Four influenza antiviral agents (amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Amantadine and rimantadine are effective against influenza A viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2012</LINK>). However, high levels of drug resistance have been recorded and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the USA until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re-established. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors effective against both influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir is approved for the treatment of people aged over one year and zanamivir for people aged over seven years. These medications should be taken within two days after the onset of symptoms and continued for five to seven days. They have been shown to lessen both the severity and duration of uncomplicated influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>). Careful use of these products is encouraged because of the emergence of resistant influenza strains (<LINK REF="REF-Moscona-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscona 2005</LINK>). Dosing and side effects vary depending on the drug, age, and hepatic and renal functions. The major side effects tend to affect the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. Other side effects include light-headedness, nervousness, anxiety, difficulty in concentration, diarrhea and anorexia. Use of amantadine in people aged &gt; 65 years, among whom some degree of renal impairment is common, particular attention should be paid to dosages (<LINK REF="REF-NACI-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NACI 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) follows a particular theoretical and methodological pathway for assessing cause, diagnosis and treatment. Chinese medicinal herbs, the most important component of TCM, are derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat the disease. Depending upon the different symptoms or causes, the herbs are selected and mixed together, following a particular process, to form the prescription.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:25:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In TCM the aim in treating influenza is not only to cure the respiratory symptoms but also to treat the whole body. In TCM, influenza is differentiated into two types: Wind-cold Syndrome and Wind-heat Syndrome (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The main symptoms of the Wind-cold type are: severe cold, slight fever, absence of sweat, headache, aching pain of extremities, stuffy nose with nasal discharge, cough with thin sputum, thin, whitish coating on the tongue and a floating and tight pulse (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Treatment of this type aims to relieve external symptoms with drugs which are pungent in flavour and warm in property, and to ventilate the lungs and expel the pathogenic cold. Herba Schizonepetae, Radix Ledebouriellae, Radix Bupleuri, Radix Platycodi and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens are usually the main components of a prescription for Wind-cold Syndrome. Moreover, supplementary drugs may be added when particular symptoms are present (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main symptoms of Wind-heat type are: a high fever, slight aversion to cold, headache, sore throat with congestion, expectoration of yellowish sputum, thirst, epistaxis, reddened tongue with a thin, yellowish coating and a floating and rapid pulse (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Treatment of this type aims to: relieve external symptoms with drugs which are pungent in flavour and cool in property, and to promote the dispersing function of the lungs and clear up pathogenic heat. Flos Lonicerae, Fructus Forsythiae, Radix Isatidis, Radix Puerariae, Folium Mori, Flos Chrysanthemi, Fructus Arctii, Herba Lophatheri and Radix Platycodi are usually the main components of a prescription for Wind-heat Syndrome. Supplementary drugs are sometimes added according to particular symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1991</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:15:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of clinical trials of Chinese medicinal herbs for influenza have been conducted. The quality and effects of all these trials had not yet been assessed and systematically reviewed. Natural medicinal herbs are potential drug resources and the therapeutic and toxic effects of medicinal herbs need to be identified through a systematic review. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent treating influenza annually in China, suggesting that a systematic review on the effectiveness of these medicinal herbs would be extremely useful in health policy planning.</P>
<P>This review summarises the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of medicinal herbs for preventing and treating influenza, according to current clinical trials.</P>

See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of the previous search.</P>
<P>We used the following search strategy to search CENTRAL and MEDLINE. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We adapted the search strategy to search EMBASE (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and CNKI (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:15:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We scanned the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved. We located full articles for further assessment when the information given suggested that the study: (1) included patients with uncomplicated influenza; (2) compared Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo or other active drugs; (3) assessed one or more relevant clinical outcome measure; (4) used random allocation for the comparison groups.</P>
<P>If there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, we retrieved the full article for clarification. We measured inter-rater agreement for study selection using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.</P>
<P>If random allocation was indicated in a trial but the randomisation procedure was not described, we telephoned the primary author to ask for detailed information regarding the randomisation procedure. We excluded the trial if the trial was a quasi-RCT or falsely randomised (allocating patients by date of birth, date of admission, hospital number, alternation, or by the investigators' or patients' choosing, etc.). We excluded trials not reporting our stated outcome measures. We also excluded studies with a high percentage (more than 20%) of dropouts.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:33:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (LHJ, TXW) independently extracted data concerning details of the study population, interventions and outcomes using a standard data extraction form, specifically designed for this review. We retrieved data on participants, interventions and outcomes, as described above. The data extraction form included the following items:</P>
<OL>
<LI>General information: published/unpublished, title, authors, reference/source, contact address, country, urban/rural etc., publication language, year of publication, duplicate publications, sponsor and setting.</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics: design, duration of follow-up, method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (patients, people administering treatment, outcome assessors), checking of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Intervention(s): placebo included, interventions(s) (dose, route, timing), comparison intervention(s) (dose, route, timing), co-medication(s) (contents, dose, route, timing).</LI>
<LI>Patients: sampling (random/convenience), exclusion criteria, total number and number in comparison groups, sex, age (children/adults), baseline characteristics, duration of influenza, diagnostic criteria, similarity of groups at baseline (including any co-morbidity), assessment of compliance, withdrawals/losses to follow-up (reasons/description), subgroups.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: outcomes specified above, any other outcomes assessed, other events, length of follow-up, quality of reporting of outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Results: for outcomes and times of assessment (including a measure of variation), if necessary converted to measures of effect specified below, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We resolved differences in data extraction by consensus and with reference to the original article. If necessary, we sought information from the authors of the primary studies. We managed to contact trial authors by letter or telephone regarding missing information and confusing points such as methods of randomisation and allocation concealment; separate information for certain patient subgroups; information about complications; and number of dropouts. We managed to contact manufacturers regarding the components of processed Chinese medicines if the components were unclear.</P>
<P>Two review authors (LHJ, TXW) independently extracted the original trial results. We resolved disagreements by discussion. For binary outcomes, we extracted the number of events and total number in each group. For continuous outcomes we extracted the mean, standard deviation and sample size from each group.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:15:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the reporting quality of each trial, based largely on the quality criteria specified by <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In particular, we studied the following factors.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Generation of the allocation sequence: an allocation sequence generated from a random numbers table, calculator or computer random-number generator was considered as a real randomised RCT. Methods of allocating participants according to their date of birth, their hospital record number, the date to which they were invited to participate in the study and so on, were considered inadequate.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: use of a central independent unit, opaque sealed envelopes, or similar, were considered adequate. Inadequate methods included those not described, an open table of random numbers or similar.</LI>
<LI>Double-blinding: blinding of participants and investigators. Not performing double-blinding or inconsistency in the delivery method (for example, tablets versus injections) were considered inadequate.</LI>
<LI>Follow-up: number of and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals described was considered adequate; number of and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals not described was considered inadequate.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories:</P>
<OL>
<LI>All quality criteria met: low risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>One or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.</LI>
<LI> One or more criteria not met: high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used this classification as the basis for a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis. Two review authors (LHJ, TXW) independently assessed each trial. We calculated internal agreement using the kappa statistic and resolved disagreements by discussion. In cases of disagreement, one review author (KL) was consulted and a judgement was made, based on a consensus.</P>

<P>We intended to include data for some medicinal herbs in a meta-analysis if possible.</P>
<P>We had decided in advance that a quantitative meta-analysis should be performed when data for an outcome measure with a similar intervention (same herbal preparation or same main components of a herbal preparation) in more than two included studies were available. The data should be dichotomous or continuous and be expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), respectively. The overall effect should be tested by using Z score with significance being set at P &lt; 0.05.</P>

<P>We obtained relevant missing data from trial authors by telephoning and carefully performing evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, randomised patients as well as the ITT, as-treated and per-protocol (PP) population.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:15:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the event of substantial clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity we did not report study results as meta-analytically pooled effect estimates. We identified heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, by using a standard Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test and a significance level of &#945; = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test. We specifically examined heterogeneity with the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, quantifying inconsistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis, where an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 75% and more indicates a considerable level of inconsistency (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When heterogeneity was found, we attempted to determine the potential causes by examining individual study and subgroup characteristics.</P>

<P>We will use a fixed-effect model when the studies in the subgroup were sufficiently similar (P &gt; 0.10, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic &lt; 50%). We used a random-effects model in the summary analysis when there was heterogeneity between the subgroups. We planned to test for publication bias by using a funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods, depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review.</P>
<P>We did not find more than two studies using similar interventions in the treatment groups and consequently we did not use a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled effect size. We analyzed data for each study and expressed the results a risk ratios (RR). We summarised the number of dropouts and the number of participants who were lost to follow-up for each study, when available, using an ITT analysis. When different herbal preparations (as the intervention) in the treatment groups were considered as a whole and then compared to certain chemical drugs in the control groups, we assessed the therapeutic effect by a qualitative analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:15:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to clinical heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses. Of the 18 included studies, only three (<LINK REF="STD-Ouyang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ouyang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1999</LINK>) indicated that compared with antiviral drugs, Chinese medicinal herbs showed a superior effect in preventing influenza and alleviating influenza symptoms.

No obvious adverse events were reported in the included studies. However, the small number of participants and studies, together with the poor quality of these studies, does not allow us to draw reliable conclusions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:51:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Definitive conclusions could not be reached as differences between the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations in the included studies lower the generalisability of the results regarding the effectiveness of TCM for patients with influenza.</P>
<P>The applicability of the included studies was limited, since their inclusion criteria, interventions, durations and outcome measures were different. More well-designed trials are required.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-09 22:55:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence from the included studies as very low to low, and the reasons for this are listed below.</P>
<P>Most of the retrieved studies did not give adequate descriptions of the methodology used, which may have misled us if we had not clarified the details, for example, inclusion of non-randomised trials and classification the trials into category B rather than C. It was an exhausting but necessary process to interview every primary trial author before deciding whether to include these trials, when the methodological details were not reported. Contacting authors by telephone was more effective than writing to them because of a higher response rate. However, even after confirmation of true randomisation, we found that the methodological quality of the studies remained poor.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment is an important marker of trial quality. However, very few potential articles considered for our review reported or performed allocation concealment; the included trials failed to perform allocation concealment, leading to high risk of selection and confounding bias.</P>
<P>In one of the included trials, no blinding was used for either the participants or the investigators, which led to a high risk of performance bias. None of the studies mentioned blinding to the outcome assessors, which promotes suspicion of detection bias. Publication bias may exist as all the included studies were published in Chinese and no primary articles reporting negative results were found. The huge difference in the number of participants between the two arms raises suspicion of inadequate randomisation or a significant number of withdrawals, which may have led to high selection or attrition bias in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Xue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>During the process of interviewing the trial authors, we understood that it was difficult for them to perform double-blinding because of certain features associated with Chinese medicinal herbs, for example, aroma and appearance. Capsules were used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Xue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1999</LINK>). Other methods included extracts from herbal medicines administered by injection by using an opaque cover around the fluid bag if the herb was of a particular colour. Many trials are conducted to assess the efficacy of a plant before making the expensive decision to produce it as a patented medicine and double-blinding is almost impossible.</P>
<P>All the patients in the included studies were diagnosed by epidemiology, clinical symptoms and routine tests. It is possible that participants with other acute respiratory infections not caused by the influenza virus, such as the common cold, may have been misdiagnosed as having influenza and were included in the trials. The disease duration on entry varied between the potential studies we retrieved for inclusion. Secondary bacterial infection or other complications that complicate influenza treatment may have been present, even if the trial authors did not find or report them.</P>
<P>In the practice of TCM, herbal preparations should match the type of 'zheng' which equates to a diagnosis. Trial authors are encouraged to explain each 'zheng' by using conventional medical terms, therefore making it more convenient for physicians and consumers to choose an appropriate preparation.</P>
<P>Regarding interventions, we considered the commonly used antiviral and antipyretic-analgesic drugs to be acceptable controls. However, there is potential for bias. If the trial author knows that a 'positive' drug was used and the study was an 'equal effect test' study, there is a potential risk that the outcome detectors will consider similar results for the two groups. In this case, even double-blinding is useless. If it is a 'superior effect test', the trial authors tend to overestimate the effect in the treatment group if allocation concealment and blinding were inadequate. When a Chinese herbal medicine combined with a supposed 'positive' intervention is found to be more effective than the 'positive' drug alone for influenza, this herbal medicine is considered effective. An alternative would be to compare Chinese medicinal herbs to a placebo (it is also recommended to compare first to placebo to test effectiveness and subsequently to compare to another treatment that was tested against placebo and proved as effective), with another 'positive' drug given to both arms.</P>
<P>For superior trial design, one of the key techniques for avoiding performance and detection bias is blinding. As most TCMs have particular characteristics, blinding is rather difficult. The TCM industry should develop a simulation agent when designing trials.</P>
<P>Although Chinese herbal medicines as a treatment for influenza and the method of manufacturing these medicines are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in trials cannot be specified. This is in marked contrast to the pharmacological agents used in conventional medicine, for which the chemical constituents, their quantities and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known. In addition, the variation between different production batches of conventional medicines is kept within specified limits. In contrast, variation between formulations and batches of pharmacological agents is inevitable in TCM, although the Chinese government specifies the acceptable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results. The application of TCM signs is also limited as not everyone is familiar with them. However, one must accept that the overall treatment concept for TCM is different to that used in conventional medicines.</P>
<P>Ten included studies reported slight adverse reactions. This suggests that the TCMs used in the included studies are safe.</P>
<P>The definition and timing of outcome measures varied between studies. The outcome measures, defined in the primary version of this review, were based on a subjective assessment of defervescence and symptom withdrawal using dichotomous data. We may have missed additional information from studies which did not use the outcome measures stated in our original review. In this updated review, we added continuous data for duration of defervescence and symptom withdrawal, as well as influenza incidence in the prophylaxis studies. In one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2004</LINK>) ibuprofen was added temporally to patients with high fever, whereas no data were provided about how many participants in each group received the extra drug. This may have influenced the results.</P>
<P>TCM signs are important outcome measures in traditional practice. We will consider including TCM signs as a secondary or an additional outcome in the next update of this review. However, it is difficult to compare or quantify TCM signs as they have subjective outcomes. For example, 'mai xiang' equates to pulse presentations. Diagnosing 'mai xiang' in TCM is a complex and difficult technique, dependent on the TCM physician's experience. TCM researchers and physicians should find a gold standard method which is repeatable and easy to practice when measuring TCM signs.</P>
<P>In addition to the methodological limitations, the imprecision of the results is a common problem in each included study. The confidence intervals for the effects were wide in most of the results. Another problem is that most Chinese medicines were tested in one study only.</P>

Information on the conduct of trials should be reported in detail according to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>). The intervention in the control group should be a placebo, no treatment or the commonly used antiviral and antipyretic-analgesic drugs, but not herbal medicines or a combination of drugs plus herbal medicines, until proved to be effective for influenza. Co-interventions given equally to both arms are acceptable. The disease duration on entry should be restricted and if economics permit, laboratory tests (routine blood tests, serum tests or pathogenic examinations) and chest X-rays should be conducted to define inclusion and exclusion criteria. Attention should also be paid to the definition of outcome measures and the incidence of adverse reactions.</P>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>In the theory of TCM, 'qi' is considered as a life force or energy in every body. 'Qi' must be kept balanced and flow freely to keep organs working well. When 'qi' is blocked in a certain part of the body, the organs involved get sick and people can have a pain there. For example, constrained 'gan qi' should be released to make 'qi' flow freely so that the liver can work well and 'qi' should be regulated to flow freely so that pain is relieved. Similarly, when the 'qi' of the lungs is not balanced, such as by being lost ascending out, people may cough; 'qi' must therefore be put down to maintain an adequate amount of 'qi' in the lungs</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Review Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2007); EMBASE (January 1988 to January 2007); CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database) (January 1980 to January 2007); and the Chinese Cochrane Center's Controlled Trials Register (up to January 2007). A comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy was formulated in an attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press and in progress) using the following terms in combination with the search strategy defined by the Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in Appendix 5c of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (Edition 4.0) (Alderson 2004). The search string was adapted for other databases.</P>

<P>After scanning the full articles, we excluded studies which were not RCTs or clinical trials.</P>
<P>We also searched databases of ongoing trials: Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com); and The National Research Register (http://www.update-software.com/National/). We attempted to identify additional studies by searching the reference lists of relevant trials, reviews, conference proceedings and journals. In particular, with respect to journals, we searched those not indexed in the electronic databases.</P>
<P>Organisations (including the WHO), individual researchers working in the field and medicinal herbal manufacturers were contacted in order to obtain additional references, unpublished trials, ongoing trials, confidential reports and raw data for published trials.</P>
