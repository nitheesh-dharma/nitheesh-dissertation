<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:47:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic condition wherein the innermost lining of the large bowel becomes inflamed. If UC affects only the last part of the bowel (distal UC), medications can be given rectally. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is used commonly to treat mild to moderately active UC. A review of the literature was undertaken to determine how effective rectal 5-ASA (e.g. enemas, suppositories or foam) is for treating distal UC. Thirty-eight studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Pooled results from these studies show that rectal 5-ASA is superior to placebo (fake suppositories, enemas or foam) for improving symptoms, improving the appearance of the bowel lining at colonoscopy, and improving the appearance of biopsies of the bowel examined microscopically. Rectal 5-ASA is also superior to rectal steroids for improving symptoms. Side effects were generally mild in nature and included abdominal pain or distention, nausea and anal discomfort or irritation. From these results, it was concluded that rectal 5-ASA should be a first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderately active distal UC.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:47:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized trials comparing rectal 5-ASA to placebo or another active therapy were eligible for inclusion. Eligible trials enrolled patients with a distal disease margin less than 60 cm from the anal verge or distal to the splenic flexure. Trials that enrolled subjects less than 12 years of age were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:57:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Eligibility was assessed by three authors. Data were extracted by two authors using standardized forms. Pooled odds ratios (POR) for inducing improvement and remission by symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic criteria were calculated using an intention to treat principle. Fixed effects models were used unless heterogeneity was encountered within groups (P &lt; 0.10), where random effects models were used. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5. Where sufficient data were available, subgroup analyses were performed for disease extent, total daily 5-ASA dose, 5-ASA formulation (enema,suppository, foam) and the type of control intervention (placebo or another active therapy).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:47:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Thirty-eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Rectal 5-ASA was superior to placebo for inducing symptomatic, endoscopic and histological improvement and remission, with POR for symptomatic improvement 8.87 (8 trials, 95% CI: 5.30 to 14.83; P &lt; 0.00001), endoscopic improvement 11.18 (5 trials, 95% CI 5.99 to 20.88; P &lt; 0.00001), histologic improvement 7.69 (6 trials, 95% CI 3.26 to 18.12; P &lt; 0.00001), symptomatic remission 8.30 (8 trials, 95% CI 4.28 to 16.12; P &lt; 0.00001), endoscopic remission 5.31 (7 trials, 95% CI 3.15 to 8.92; P &lt; 0.00001), and histologic remission 6.28 (5 trials, 95% CI 2.74 to 14.40; P &lt; 0.0001). Rectal 5-ASA was superior to rectal corticosteroids for inducing symptomatic improvement and remission with POR 1.56 (6 trials, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.11; P = 0.004) and 1.65 (6 trials, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.45; P = 0.01), respectively. Rectal 5-ASA was not superior to oral 5-ASA for symptomatic improvement (POR 2.25; 95% CI 0.53 to 19.54; P = 0.27). Neither total daily dose nor 5-ASA formulation affected treatment response.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 09:50:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Rectal 5-ASA should be considered a first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. The optimal total daily dose and dose frequency of 5-ASA remain to be determined. Future research should define differences in efficacy among patient subgroups defined by proximal disease margin and disease activity. There is a strong need for consensus standardization of outcome measurements for clinical trials in ulcerative colitis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-03 09:50:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the large intestine that causes diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. The inflammation of UC always involves the rectum, and extends proximally in a continuous fashion for a variable distance. In most patients, the disease does not extend proximal to the splenic flexure at presentation. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is considered to be a first-line therapy for mild to moderately active UC. 5-ASA can be administered orally, or delivered rectally in the form of a suppository, foam or liquid enema.</P>
<P>The use of rectal therapy to treat UC has several potential advantages. Because medication can be delivered directly to the site of maximum inflammation, mucosal drug exposure can be increased. Local therapy can also reduce mucosal absorption and systemic toxicity. However, gains in efficacy and safety must be weighed against patient preference, which often favours oral delivery.</P>
<P>In order to further define the role of rectal 5-ASA in the management of UC, a systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to compare the efficacy of rectal 5-ASA to other oral or rectal therapies and to placebo, for the treatment of mild to moderately active distal UC.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:47:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Studies were accepted if they enrolled subjects who were at least 12 years of age with a distal disease margin less than 60 cm from the anal verge or distal to the splenic flexure, as determined by either barium enema or colonoscopy. A minimum age threshold was applied to limit potential differences in distribution of rectal formulations that may result from age related differences in colonic volume.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 09:50:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Trials were eligible for inclusion if rectal 5-ASA (formulated as a liquid enema, foam or suppository) was used in at least one treatment arm.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-11-03 09:50:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary outcome measure was symptomatic improvement. Secondary measures included symptomatic remission, histologic improvement or remission, endoscopic improvement or remission, and change in Disease Activity Index (DAI). The influences of 5-ASA dose and disease extent on efficacy were explored in subgroup analyses. It was anticipated, a priori, that there would be substantial differences among trials regarding the definitions of response and remission by clinical, endoscopic and histologic criteria. Accordingly, the original authors' definitions for each of these outcomes were accepted. Where studies reported only a composite outcome that combined symptom response with either endoscopic or histologic response, this outcome was considered to be a measure of symptomatic response or remission.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2009-11-04 10:17:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>A computer aided search was conducted in the MEDLINE database (1966 to 2008) to identify randomised clinical trials evaluating rectal 5-ASA for treatment of active UC in patients over age 12. Search strategies used the Boolean operator "and" to combine the following groups of medical subject headings (MeSH):</P>
<UL>
<LI>MeSH for ulcerative colitis (combined using "or"): ulcerative colitis, proctocolitis, proctosigmoiditis, rectocolitis, recto-sigmoiditis, ulcerative rectocolitis, ulcerative proctocolitis, hemorrhagic ulcerative, hemorrhagic proctocolitis and proctitis.</LI>
<LI>MeSH for 5-aminosalicylic acid (combined using "or"): 5-ASA, 5-aminosalicylate, mesalamine, Mesalazine, Asacol, Claversal, Pentasa, Rowasa, Salofalk, Mesasal and olsalazine.</LI>
<LI>MeSH for form of intervention (combined using "or"): topical administration, topical drug administration, suppository, rectal administration, rectal instillation, rectal drug administration, anal drug administration, foam and enema.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The MEDLINE database search was supplemented by a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register and a manual review of bibliographies and abstracts submitted to major gastroenterology meetings (1997 to 2008) published in the following journals: Gastroenterology; Gut; American Journal of Gastroenterology; Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; and Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology.</P>
<P>Reference lists from all articles retrieved were also scanned to identify additional citations that were overlooked in the initial search.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:48:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Abstracts from citations retrieved from the literature search were first reviewed by a single author (MT) to exclude papers clearly ineligible for the review. For the remaining citations, full publications were retrieved and assessed formally for eligibility by three authors (MT, JN and JKM). Where key data were not provided in the publication, original authors were contacted and asked to provide clarification. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa and disagreements were resolved by consensus of the reviewers.</P>
<P>
<B>Eligibility Assessment:</B>
</P>
<P>A standardized form was used to assess eligibility for inclusion in the review. Each of the following criteria were rated on a three-point scale as "yes", "no" or "not stated":</P>
<UL>
<LI>Age of all participants at least 12 years;</LI>
<LI>Proven diagnosis of UC in all subjects;</LI>
<LI>Disease extent less than 60cm from anal verge or distal to the splenic flexure on barium enema or colonoscopy;</LI>
<LI>Rectal 5-ASA assessed as intervention in at least one treatment arm;</LI>
<LI>Treatment allocation randomised or quasi-randomised; and</LI>
<LI>Symptom score included as at least one study outcome.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Data Extraction:</B>
</P>
<P>A standardized data extraction form was used by two independent authors. Data extracted from each eligibility study included the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Numbers of subjects randomised to the 5-ASA treatment and control arms;</LI>
<LI>Intervention used in each arm (dose, formulation, dose frequency, duration);</LI>
<LI>Patients characteristics (age, gender, disease extent, disease duration, and use of concomitant oral corticosteroids and 5-ASA);</LI>
<LI>Numbers of subjects in each arm who completed treatment, dropped out, or dropped out due to adverse effects;</LI>
<LI>Numbers of subjects in each arm who improved or entered remission by symptomatic, histologic and endoscopic criteria;</LI>
<LI>Median numbers of days to symptomatic response and symptomatic remission;</LI>
<LI>Mean changes in DAI; and</LI>
<LI>Definitions of improvement and remission (symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic) used in the study.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment of trials:</B>
</P>
<P>The methodologic quality of each trial was assessed using the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), which evaluates the adequacy of blinding, randomisation and reporting of withdrawals and dropouts. In addition to the Jadad scale, the authors also applied a face-validated scale used in their previous published meta-analyses of therapies for UC (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1997</LINK>). For each of the following methodologic criteria this instrument assigns a score 0 (not described), 1 (partially described) or 2 (fully described) and possible scores range from 0 to 30:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inclusion and exclusion criteria;</LI>
<LI>Number of subjects excluded and reasons for exclusion stated;</LI>
<LI>Proven diagnosis of UC on histology;</LI>
<LI>Exclusion of infectious colitis;</LI>
<LI>Patient demographics described and similar among treatment arms;</LI>
<LI>Description of drug preparation for all interventions;</LI>
<LI>Description of randomisation method;</LI>
<LI>Sequential enrolment;</LI>
<LI>Assessor blinding to treatment arm;</LI>
<LI>Patient blinding to treatment arm;</LI>
<LI>Standardized assessment criteria for outcome;</LI>
<LI>Frequency and profile of adverse events;</LI>
<LI>Description of statistical methods and their appropriateness;</LI>
<LI>Accounting of all dropouts; and</LI>
<LI>Documentation and monitoring of patient compliance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Cochrane risk of bias tool as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) was also utilized. Briefly, an assessment was made of the method of allocation generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?), allocation concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?), blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?), incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?); and selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?). A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. </P>
<P>
<B>Data Analysis:</B>
</P>
<P>Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each endpoint (improvement and remission by symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic criteria) for each trial. An intention to treat principle was used, with the total number of patients randomised to each study arm as the denominator for each proportion. A pooled odds ratio (POR) for each endpoint was then calculated for all trials reporting that endpoint using a fixed effects model (Mantel-Haenstzel). PORs were calculated for comparisons of rectal 5-ASA versus placebo, rectal corticosteroids and oral 5-ASA, and for comparisons among rectal 5-ASA doses and formulations. Homogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test and by visual inspection of Forest plots. If heterogeneity was encountered within groups (P &lt; 0.10), a random effects model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5. Where sufficient data were available, these analyses were repeated within subgroups of patients defined by disease extent, total daily 5-ASA dose, 5-ASA formulation (enema, suppository, foam) and the type of control intervention (placebo or another active therapy).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Andus-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Andus 2008</LINK> undertook a 6-week single blind randomised multicenter trial that compared the efficacy and tolerability of 5-ASA suppositories 1.0 g daily (n = 201) compared to 0.5 g three times daily (n = 207) in 408 adult patients with ulcerative proctitis extending no more than 15 cm from the anal verge and with disease activity index (DAI) scores between 3 and 11 (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>). Patients who had received oral or rectal 5-ASA within 4 weeks, immunosuppressants within 3 months, or corticosteroids within one month of the baseline assessment were excluded. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (defined as DAI &lt; 4) at the final/withdrawal visit. Secondary endpoints included clinical activity index (CAI), endoscopic and histologic remission and improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>) and PGA (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 1993</LINK>). The rates of remission were similar on 1.0 g daily vs. 0.5 g three times daily: (clinical in 84.0% versus 84.7%, endoscopic in 80.1% versus 85.4% and histologic in 3.0% versus 3.9%). The authors concluded that both treatments were of similar efficacy and well tolerated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1987</LINK> reported a randomised double-blind multi-centre trial comparing 5-ASA enemas (1 g/day) to prednisolone enemas (25 mg/day) administered for 4 weeks in 123 patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. Clinical and endoscopic disease activity was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Binder-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1970</LINK>, with treatment responses categorized as remission, improvement, no change or deterioration. The overall response to therapy was defined as the sum of the clinical and endoscopic effects, wherein a negative effect on one outcome could cancel a positive effect on another. Subjects who were asymptomatic at 2 weeks discontinued the study medication, while the remainder continued on treatment for another 2 weeks. Among 61 subjects randomised to 5-ASA and 62 to prednisolone, 4 were withdrawn for protocol violation, 2 for poor compliance and 3 for adverse events. Adverse events were reported in 13 patients on 5-ASA (3 leading to study withdrawal) compared to 6 on prednisolone, a difference that was not statistically significant. All adverse events were described as minor and reversible. Twenty seven subjects discontinued study medication at 2 weeks because of remission (15 on 5-ASA versus 12 on prednisolone) and 12 subjects discontinued therapy because of worsening disease, leaving 75 who were treated for an additional 2 weeks. Overall, 77% on 5-ASA versus 72% on prednisolone improved after 2 weeks (no significant difference), but 51% versus 31% entered remission (P &lt; 0.05). Among the 27 subjects withdrawn at 2 weeks because of remission, rates of relapse over the subsequent 2 weeks were similar in both arms. Among those who continued treatment for an additional 2 weeks, incremental rates of remission and improvement were similar in the two arms. The authors concluded that topical 5-ASA is an acceptable alternative to topical corticosteroid therapy in mild to moderately active distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 1999</LINK> conducted a multi-centre randomised, cross-over trial comparing 5-ASA foam 2 g twice daily to 5-ASA enema 2 g twice daily for 3 weeks (Phase I). If remission was not achieved by 3 weeks, patients were crossed over to the other treatment for a further 3 weeks (Phase II). Patients were included if they were 18 to 70 years of age and had endoscopically confirmed proctitis, proctosigmoiditis or left-sided UC. Mucosal biopsies and stool cultures were required only for new diagnoses. Subjects were excluded if they had used glucocorticosteroids within one month or immunosuppressive drugs within 3 months. Oral 5-ASA was permitted only if the current flare had occurred while on oral 5-ASA and the dose was not changed. Outcome measures included clinical symptoms (symptom diary cards), clinical examination, sigmoidoscopy and quality of life. Disease activity was evaluated according to the Clinical Activity Index (CAI) and Endoscopic Index (EI) of <LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>. Clinical remission was defined as CAI &lt; 4 and endoscopic remission as an EI score &lt; 6. An intention-to-treat analysis was used. Of 195 patients randomised to 5-ASA enema (n = 98) or 5-ASA foam (n = 97) for Phase I, 58 completed Phase II. Twenty five patients withdrew prematurely (9 in the enema group and 16 in the foam group. A further 10 patients (2 in the enema group, 8 in the foam group) were lost to follow-up. There was an imbalance between the groups with respect to concomitant oral 5-ASA use (41% enema , 29% foam ) but baseline characteristics were otherwise similar. Clinical remission in Phase I was achieved by 77% treated with enema versus 62% treated with foam. Endoscopic remission in Phase I was achieved by 70% on enemas versus 57% on foam. Both clinical and endoscopic remission in Phase I was achieved by 67% and 54%, respectively. In Phase II, clinical and endoscopic remission was achieved in 66% of subjects who crossed over to the enema and 70% of those who crossed over to the foam. No difference in remission rates achieved statistical significance. Although this study did not use a non-inferiority design, the authors concluded that 5-ASA foam and 5-ASA enema were of similar efficacy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Basilico-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Basilico 1987</LINK> randomised 30 patients with mild to moderate distal UC to 5-ASA enemas 1.5 g twice daily (n = 13) or sulphasalazine enemas 1.5 g twice daily (n = 14) for 4 weeks. Patients had ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis confirmed by sigmoidoscopy and histology. Oral 5-ASA maintenance therapy was allowed to continue at fixed dose, but corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents were prohibited. Clinical, histologic and endoscopic outcomes were graded on 3-point scales by blinded evaluators. Patients were said to be in remission when subjective well-being was "well", no blood or mucopus was present in the faeces, and the sigmoidoscopic appearance was not hemorrhagic. Three patients (2 on 5-ASA and 1 on sulphasalazine) did not adhere to the protocol and were excluded from analysis. Patient demographics were similar between the two groups with the exception of disease location (10 and 4 patients, respectively, on sulphasalazine had proctitis and proctosigmoiditis versus 5 and 8, respectively, on 5-ASA). Among subjects who completed the trial, remission was achieved in 9 of 13 patients in the 5-ASA group versus 3 of 14 on sulphasalazine. No adverse events occurred. The authors concluded that the 5-ASA enema was superior to the sulphasalazine enema for inducing remission when given at similar doses, and suggested that this was because sulphasalazine yields a lower effective dose of 5-ASA.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi_x002d_Porro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi-Porro 1995</LINK> randomised 52 patients with moderately active UC distal to the splenic flexure, to receive 1g 5-ASA (n = 27) or 100 mg hydrocortisone enemas (n = 25) for 3 weeks in a double-dummy design. Sulphasalazine and 5-ASA were continued at stable doses. Subjects were excluded if they had used steroids within 4 weeks. Clinical, endoscopic and histological activity was assessed using the criteria of Truelove and Witts (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>) and Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>). Remission was defined as disappearance of symptoms and endoscopic and histological signs of disease activity index (grade = 0). Improvement was defined as reduction one or more grade from baseline. The groups were similar at baseline. No adverse events were reported. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic improvement was seen in 89%, 74% and 56% of the 5-ASA group compared to 70%, 56% and 60% of the hydrocortisone group. The authors noted the unusually high rate of clinical improvement in the 5-ASA group and concluded that rectal 5-ASA is an acceptable and safe alternative to topical steroids for treatment of mild to moderately active distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Biancone-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Biancone 2007</LINK> conducted an 8-week randomised multicenter, double blind trial comparing 3 mg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) foam (n = 26) or enema (n = 24) to 2 g 5-ASA foam (n = 20) or enema (n = 22) in patients with mild to moderate UC. Eligible subjects had a baseline DAI between 3 and 9 and endoscopic score or 1 or 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>), and had not been in remission for at least 3 months. Histology was graded according toTruelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>). Corticosteroids (topical, oral, parenteral), immunosuppressants, and topical sulphasalazine or 5-ASA were not allowed. However, oral sulphasalazine and 5-ASA were continued in patients who had relapsed on maintenance treatment. The primary end point was remission at 4 weeks defined as DAI &lt; 3. Secondary endpoints included remission at 8 weeks and response (defined as a reduction in DAI of at least 1 point). Rates of remission did not differ significantly between BDP and 5-ASA (24% versus 28% at 4 weeks and 36% versus 52% at 8 weeks). DAI dropped significantly from baseline at 4 and 8 weeks on both BDP and 5-ASA. Response rates were also similar in both groups at both time points. Adverse events were reported in 33% of patients on BDP versus 25% on 5-ASA. Treatment was discontinued in 6.0% on BDP versus 7.5% on 5-ASA. The authors concluded that rectal BDP and rectal 5-ASA had comparable tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1984</LINK> conducted a randomised, double-blind clinical trial comparing 4-ASA enemas (2 g/day; n = 31) to 5-ASA enemas (2 g/day; n = 32) in 63 patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. Disease activity was evaluated before and after a 15-day treatment period, using clinical, sigmoidoscopic and histologic criteria. Clinical and histological grading was based on Truelove and Witts (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>) and sigmoidoscopy grading was based on Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>). Disease could not extend beyond the splenic flexure on either endoscopy or barium enema. Randomization was stratified by use and non-usage of Salazopyrin 2 g/day maintenance therapy- which was continued. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. No drop-outs or adverse events were observed. Clinical improvement was experienced by 77% of 4-ASA patients compared to 81% of 5-ASA patients. Sigmoidoscopic improvement occurred in 77% and 78%, and histological improvement occurred in 41% and 46% of 4-ASA and 5-ASA patients, respectively. Although a non-inferiority design was not used, the authors concluded that both rectal 4-ASA and rectal 5-ASA are effective for distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1988</LINK> randomised 39 subjects with mild to moderately active distal UC to 2 g 5-ASA enemas once daily or 1 g 5-ASA suppositories twice daily for 1 month. Disease extent was confirmed between 10 cm and 20 cm from the anal verge at sigmoidoscopy. Sulphasalazine was continued in patients on maintenance therapy. Clinical, sigmoidoscopic and histologic responses were defined by one-point reductions in the corresponding Truelove and Richards score (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>). Clinical remission required subjects to be symptom free. Sigmoidoscopic remission was defined as repaired rectal mucosa and histologic remission was defined as the absence of inflammation. Practicality and tolerability were also scored by subjects. Among 20 patients randomised to enemas and 19 randomised to suppositories, baseline characteristics were similar with the exception of gender (25% female on enemas versus 63% on suppositories). No drop-outs or adverse events were reported. At 4 weeks, outcomes on enemas versus suppositories were 90% versus 85% for clinical improvement, 80% versus 75% for clinical remission, 85% versus 85% for endoscopic improvement, and 65% versus 70% for endoscopic remission, 80% versus 80% for histologic improvement, and 45% versus 60% for histologic remission. None of these comparisons was significant. Both enemas and suppositories were well tolerated but most patients preferred suppositories. The authors concluded that 5-ASA enemas and 5-ASA suppositories are of similar efficacy for treatment of ulcerative proctitis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1990a</LINK> reported a multi-centre double-blind study comparing 5-ASA suppositories at total daily doses of 1 g (n = 32) and 1.5 g (n = 31) to placebo (n = 31) for 4 weeks in subjects with mild to moderately active ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. Disease margin extended no more than 20cm from the anal verge. Oral 5-ASA and sulphasalazine were continued at stable dose but steroids were not permitted within 7 days of enrolment. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of symptoms with no more than two bowel movements per day and no blood. Clinical improvement was defined as any other decrease in symptom scores. Endoscopic and histologic remissions were defined as one point reductions in the <LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK> and Truelove and Richards scales (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>), respectively. Analysis followed an intention-to-treat principle. Baseline characteristics were similar except for gender (58% female on 1.5 g 5-ASA versus 25% on 1 g 5-ASA and 32% on placebo). Eleven patients did not complete the trial (2 on 5-ASA 1.5 g/day and 9 on placebo), mostly for non-compliance or worsening of symptoms. At week 4, clinical remission was observed in 39% on placebo versus 69% on 5-ASA 1 g/day and 74% on 5-ASA 1.5g/day (P &lt; 0.01 for 5-ASA versus placebo but no significant difference between 5-ASA doses). Similarly, endoscopic remission was observed in 23% on placebo versus 55% on 1 g 5-ASA and 59% on 1.5 g 5-ASA. Histologic remission was attained in 6% on placebo versus 10% on 1 g 5-ASA and 16% on 1.5 g 5-ASA. Few adverse events were documented. The authors concluded that 5-ASA suppositories are effective for mild to moderately active ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, but that no dose effect could be confirmed.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1991a</LINK> reported a double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing sucralfate 10 g (n = 18) versus 5-ASA 2 g (n = 18) and placebo (n = 14) as 100 ml liquid enemas in patients with mild to moderately active UC with proximal disease margin confirmed by endoscopy to extend no further than the splenic flexure. Sulphasalazine was continued if at a stable dose for at least one month prior to enrolment, but steroids were not permitted. Clinical, endoscopic and histological activity was assessed using Truelove and Richards' criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>), with improvement defined as a one-point reduction in each score. Baseline characteristics of the three treatment groups were similar. Clinical improvement was reported in 22% on sucralfate, 94% on 5-ASA and 14% on placebo. Endoscopic improvement was seen in 22%, 88% and 14%, respectively. Histology improved in 17%, 83% and 7%, respectively. All outcomes with 5-ASA were significantly better than those with sucralfate and placebo, but sucralfate showed no benefit over placebo. The authors concluded that 5-ASA enemas, but not sucralfate enemas, are effective for distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1993</LINK> reported a randomised investigator-blind trial comparing 5-ASA foam to 5-ASA enema for three weeks in patients with a mild to moderate relapse of distal UC extending more than 15 cm from the anal verge. Subjects were excluded if the flare had lasted longer than two weeks, if they were already receiving rectal 5-ASA, or if they had received steroids for more than seven days. The dose of study medication was adjusted to disease activity; subjects with mild disease (n = 117) received 2 g/day while those with moderate disease (n = 116) received 4 g/day. Oral sulphasalazine and 5-ASA were continued at stable doses. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the investigator as remission, improved, unchanged and worsened. Endoscopic appearance and grading was assessed using modified <LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK> criteria, and histology was rated according to Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>). Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms in both disease activity strata. In the mild disease stratum, clinical remission was seen in 54% of foam patients compared to 31% of enema patients at 10 days, and in 83% versus 74% respectively at 3 weeks. This difference was statistically significant at 10 days but not at 3 weeks. At 3 weeks, endoscopic remission was achieved by 65% and 56%, and histological remission was achieved by 40% and 41% of foam and enema patients respectively. A total of 6 subjects dropped out or were lost to follow-up. In the moderate disease activity stratum, clinical remission on foam versus enema was seen in 63% versus 52% at 3 weeks. Endoscopic remission was achieved by 38% and 34%, and histological remission was achieved by 28% and 20%, of foam and enema patients, respectively. A total of 11 patients dropped out of the study. The authors concluded that no significant difference was seen overall between foam and enemas, but that numeric trends favoured foam and that foam induced response more rapidly in patients with mild disease.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1990b</LINK> reported a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study of 5-ASA suppositories 1.5 g/day for one month in 62 patients with mild to moderately active UC extending less than 20 cm from the anal verge at sigmoidoscopy. Oral sulphasalazine was continued at a stable dose, but corticosteroids were not permitted. Clinical, endoscopic and histological activity was assessed after 15 days and 1 month according to Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>), with improvement defined as a one-point reduction in each score. Clinical remission was defined as a complete disappearance of symptoms, endoscopic remission as repaired mucosa and histologic remission as the absence of active inflammation on biopsy. Baseline characteristics in both arms were similar. At 30 days, clinical remission was achieved by 56% of 5-ASA patients compared to 7% of placebo patients. Endoscopic remission was achieved by 41% versus 7%, and histological remission by 28% versus 3%. No adverse effects or drop outs were reported. For all endpoints, 5-ASA suppositories were significantly superior to placebo (P &lt; 0.01). The authors confirmed that 5-ASA suppositories should be the first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative proctitis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1991b</LINK> reported a randomised double-blind dose-response trial comparing 5-ASA enemas (1 g, 2 g and 4 g) to placebo for 4 weeks in 113 patients with mild to moderately active UC distal to the splenic flexure at endoscopy. Patients were stratified by use of sulphasalazine. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic activity was assessed according to Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>), with improvement in each category defined as a one point reduction from baseline. Clinical remission was defined as complete resolution of acute symptoms. Endoscopic remission was described as repaired mucosa with a visible vascular pattern, and histologic remission as the absence of active inflammation. Twenty seven patients were randomised to the 1 g 5-ASA group, 30 to 2 g 5-ASA, 29 to 4 g 5-ASA and 27 to placebo. Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were similar, no drop outs occurred and 1 patient in each group reported a minor adverse event. Clinical remission was noted at 30 days in 85% of subjects on 1 g 5-ASA, 83% on 2 g 5-ASA, 86% on 4 g 5-ASA and 41% on placebo. Endoscopic improvement or remission was achieved in 74%, 73%, 79% and 30% respectively. Histologic improvement or remission was achieved in 63%, 70%, 76% and 15%. There were no statistically significant differences among the 5-ASA treatment arms, but all outcomes for 5-ASA patients were superior to placebo. The authors concluded that topical 5-ASA is effective for treatment of distal UC, but that its efficacy is not dose-dependent. Accordingly, the lowest dose was advocated as first-line therapy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2008</LINK> reported a randomised controlled investigator blind non-inferiority trial comparing 5-ASA foam enemas (1 g/ 80 ml/day) to liquid enemas (1 g/100 ml/day) for 4 weeks in 395 patients with mild to moderate left sided active UC distal to the splenic flexure by colonoscopy or endoscopy. Patients were stratified according to disease extent; first stratum included patients with proctitis and proctosigmoiditis and second stratum included patients with disease extension from 60 cm to to splenic flexure. Patients on a stable oral dose of 5-ASA maintenance treatment for at least one month or stable dose of azathioprine or methotrexate for at least six months prior to study were included. Clinical and endoscopic activity was assessed according to <LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK> with clinical remission defined by a CAI score of &#8804; 2 and endoscopic remission by EI score of &lt; 4. One hundred and ninety one patients were randomised to receive foam enema and 184 to liquid enema.Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were similar but there were more men than women in the foam group. Fifty-two patients in the foam group and 59 patients in the liguid enema group reported minor adverse effects(AE) with gastrointestinal disorders as the most frequently reported AE. At 4 weeks clinical remission was noted in 66.7% of patients in the foam group compared to 70.5% in the liquid enema group. Endoscopic remission was achieved in 64.2% patients in the foam group and 72.7% in the liquid enema. In secondary analysis, clinical remission was achieved at 2 weeks in 48.1%% of patients receiving foam enema to 50.6% in the liquid enema group. The authors concluded that 5-ASA mesalamine foam provides a therapeutic alternative to liquid enema in mild to moderately active left sided UC. Non-inferiority of the foam enema was achieved at 2 and 4 weeks in the ITT population and at 2 weeks in the PP analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Eliakim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eliakim 2007</LINK> conducted a randomised multicenter trial comparing low volume 5-ASA foam (1 g/30 ml) to high volume 5-ASA foam (1 g/60 ml) in 330 patients with distal UC. Eligible patients had baseline CAI &gt; 4 and endoscopy index (EI) &gt; 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>). Histology was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Riley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1991</LINK>. Patients who had received steroids within one month or immunosuppressants within three months prior to entry, and those who had relapsed on oral sulphasalazine, oral 5-ASA &gt; 2 g/day or rectal 5-ASA &gt; 1 g/day were excluded. All oral and rectal treatments for UC were stopped at baseline. The primary objective was clinical remission at the final visit, defined as CAI &lt; 4. Secondary endpoints included clinical improvement based on CAI, DAI and EI. Clinical remission rates at 6 weeks were 77% on low-volume foam (n = 163) and 77% on high-volume foam (n = 167). The percentages of patients experiencing adverse events were similar in both groups: 31% versus 29% for mild events and 10% versus 11% for moderate events on low- versus high-volume foam. The authors concluded that low-volume 5-ASA foam is as effective as high-volume foam in the treatment of UC, but that the low-volume foam might offer the advantage of improved compliance.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Farup-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Farup 1995</LINK> reported a 4-week randomised trial comparing 5-ASA suppositories (500 mg bid) to hydrocortisone foam (178 mg bid) in 79 patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. Randomization was stratified by disease extent (proctitis versus proctosigmoiditis). For entry, the proximal disease margin had to extend no further than the splenic flexure, with a disease activity index (DAI) score greater than 6. Oral 5-ASA and sulphasalazine were continued at stable doses. The DAI was defined as the sum of the CAI and EAI. The CAI scored stool frequency, stool consistency, presence of blood, abdominal pain, rectal urgency and a physician rating of disease activity. The EAI scored mucosal granularity, vascular pattern, friability and damage (exudate, erosions and ulcers). Histology was graded using modified <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1986</LINK> criteria. Remission was defined as a DAI less than 2. Improvement was defined as a DAI greater than 2 but lower than the baseline score. Non-responders had no change or worsening of the DAI score. Subjects who were in remission or non-responders at 2 weeks were withdrawn from the study, while the remainder completed a 4-week treatment course. Baseline demographics of the 5-ASA group (n = 41) and the hydrocortisone group (n = 38) were similar. Six patients in each group reported adverse events but all completed the trial. Twenty seven subjects were withdrawn after 2 weeks (17 for remission and 10 for non-response), while 52 completed 4 weeks of treatment. Compliance was adequate (&gt; 80%). The 5-ASA suppository was better tolerated than the hydrocortisone foam. Remission rates at 2 and 4 weeks were 27% and 16% for 5-ASA suppositories compared to 42% and 34% for hydrocortisone foam (differences not significant). Response rates were higher among patients with proctitis than among those with proctosigmoiditis. There was a non-significant trend toward better histologic improvement with 5-ASA suppositories at 2 and 4 weeks (70% and 78% versus 50% and 61%). Subjects on 5-ASA suppositories had a greater mean increase in DAI than those on hydrocortisone foam, which was attributed to better efficacy in the subgroup with proctitis. The authors concluded that, although both 5-ASA suppositories and hydrocortisone foam are effective for distal UC, 5-ASA suppositories should be the first choice in patients with proctitis due to better efficacy, favourable safety and good tolerability.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1986</LINK> reported a small randomised double-blind trial comparing 5-ASA enemas (4 g/day) to hydrocortisone enemas in 18 patients with UC who had not responded to 3 weeks of hydrocortisone enemas. The proximal disease margin was between 5 cm and 60 cm from the anal verge at endoscopy. Systemic steroids or immunosuppressants were allowed if administered at stable dose for one month before study entry. Endoscopy was graded as normal, erythema, friability, spontaneous bleeding or exudates and ulceration. The CAI assessed stool frequency and the proportion of stools with watery consistency or blood. A change of 1 point in the CAI was determined to be clinically significant. Histology was graded as normal, chronic inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria with no acute inflammation and or no mild architectural distortion, mild cryptitis with acute inflammatory cell infiltrate and crypt abscesses or extensive crypt injury with abscesses and ulceration. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Compliance was greater than 90%, according to symptom diaries and empty medication containers. After 3 weeks 78% of subjects on 5-ASA versus 22% on hydrocortisone experienced clinical improvement. Both endoscopic and histologic scores improved in 67% on 5-ASA versus 22% on hydrocortisone. No adverse events were reported. Patients randomised to hydrocortisone were offered a further 3 weeks of open-label 5-ASA enemas, and 4 of 6 patients experienced clinical improvement. The authors concluded that 5-ASA enemas are effective in patients with distal UC not responding to hydrocortisone enemas (with or without sulphasalazine).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 1997</LINK> reported a randomised trial comparing once daily 1 g 5-ASA suppositories to twice daily 500 mg 5-ASA suppositories for 4 weeks in 50 patients with active UC extending no more than 20 cm from the anal verge as confirmed by endoscopy and histology. Participants were required to have a baseline DAI score &gt; 3 and were excluded if they had previously failed topical 5-ASA or had taken any rectal therapy within 14 days. Immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued for 3 months and steroids for 2 weeks before study entry. Oral sulphasalazine or 5-ASA at a stable dose for 4 weeks was continued. The trial was only investigator-blind, due to differences in dose frequency and suppository size between the two groups. Clinical and endoscopic outcomes were assessed using the DAI and physician's global assessment (PGA) with clinical remission defined as a DAI of 0. The clinical component of the DAI assessed stool frequency and rectal bleeding. The endoscopic component was graded as normal, mild (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), moderate (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions) or severe (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). Histology was assessed using Truelove and Richards' criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>) with remission defined as a score of 1. Twenty five patients received 5-ASA 1 g once daily and 25 patients received 5-ASA 500 mg twice daily. The two groups had similar demographic characteristics at study entry and all subjects completed the 4 week trial. After 2 weeks, those in the 1 g group demonstrated a greater reduction in physician global assessment (PGA) and DAI scores, and were more likely to be in remission. These differences did not persist at 4 weeks. The proportion of patients in each group who reached clinical, endoscopic or histological remission was not statistically different (84%, 80% and 52% in the 1 g group compared to 76%, 72% and 48% in the 500 mg group, respectively). No significant adverse events were reported in either group but the 1 g suppository was better tolerated. The authors concluded that 1 g suppositories once daily induced faster improvement and remission than 500 mg suppositories twice daily.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 1998</LINK> compared oral 5-ASA (800 mg TID) to 5-ASA suppositories (400 mg TID) for 4 weeks in 58 patients with UC extending less than 15cm from the anal verge at endoscopy and DAI &gt; 3 in an investigator-blind randomised trial. Patients who had previously failed 5-ASA or who were taking 5-ASA or oral sulphasalazine at baseline were excluded. Immunosuppressive agents had to be discontinued for 3 months and corticosteroids for 2 weeks before entry. Clinical and endoscopic activity was assessed using <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK> criteria at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 with remission defined as a DAI sub-scale score of 0. Histology was assessed using Truelove and Richards' criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>) with remission defined as a score of 1. The treatment groups had similar demographic characteristics and all subjects completed the trial. At 4 weeks the mean DAI was significantly lower on 5-ASA suppositories (1.48 versus 3.48, P &lt; 0.001). Rates of clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission were 89.6%, 72.4% and 62% on suppositories versus 41.4%, 34.5% and 17.2% on oral 5-ASA (P &lt; 0.01). No suppository patients compared to 6 oral 5-ASA patients reported adverse events (headache, abdominal pain, nausea). There were no serious adverse events. The authors concluded that 5-ASA suppositories should be considered first-line treatment for patients with active distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 1999</LINK> reported a randomised, investigator blind, multicenter trial comparing 5-ASA gel enema 2 g/day (n = 50) to 5-ASA foam enema 2 g/day (n = 53) in with mild to moderately active distal UC with DAI at least 3. Patients who had flared while receiving rectal steroids or 5-ASA or who had taken oral steroids or immunosuppressives within 3 months were excluded. Those on oral 5-ASA could continue at a stable dose throughout the study. Primary endpoints were clinical, endoscopic and histologic improvement and remission. Endoscopy was assessed using the <LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK> score. Clinical or endoscopic improvement was defined by a 1 point improvement in the appropriate DAI sub-scale and remission as a sub-scale score of 0. Histologic response was assessed using the criteria of Truelove and Richards (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>) with remission defined as a score of 1 and improvement as a decrease of a 1 point from baseline. Only a per protocol analysis was reported. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. A total of 7 patients were excluded from the clinical and endoscopic analysis (1 in the gel group for protocol violation, 6 in the foam group: 1 noncompliance, 3 protocol violation, 2 lost to follow up), leaving 96 subjects. An additional 11 patients were excluded from analysis of histologic outcomes (8 on gel and 3 on foam) because of histologic remission at study entry. Five patients in the foam group withdrew due to lack of improvement or poor compliance, but were included in the ITT analysis. At 4 weeks, clinical, endoscopic and histologic improvement was achieved by 18%, 37% and 45% in the gel group compared to 19%, 34% and 50% in the foam group. At 4 weeks clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission was achieved by 76%, 51% and 30% in the gel group, versus 69%, 52% and 30% in the foam group. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups. Mean DAI scores fell significantly in both groups, but there was no difference between the groups. There was no difference in safety between the two groups, but the gel enema was better tolerated. The authors concluded that 5-ASA gel enema is at least as effective as 5-ASA foam and may be better tolerated</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 2005</LINK> randomised patients with active distal UC (DAI 3 to 10) to receive 5-ASA 1 g enemas (n = 106) or beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 3 mg enemas (n = 111) for 6 weeks. The study was investigator-blind. The primary outcome was the <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK> DAI, with improvement defined as a decrease of 3 points and remission as a score of 0. Sulphasalazine and oral 5-ASA were continued if their dose had been stable for 6 weeks. Patients on steroids or immunosuppressive agents were excluded. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. There were a total of 34 withdrawals (18 BDP and 16 5-ASA) and 32 adverse events (15 in BDP and 17 in 5-ASA), with only one serious event in the BDP group that was judged not to be related to the study drug. DAI significantly decreased in both groups. Rates of clinical improvement and remission were 37% and 30% for BDP patients compared to 49% and 25% for 5-ASA patients (differences not statistically significant). The authors concluded that both BDP and 5-ASA enemas improve disease activity and are well tolerated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 1998</LINK> randomised 287 patients with mild to moderately active UC extending less than 30 cm from the anal verge to 5-ASA enemas (1 g, 2 g or 4 g daily) or placebo enemas for 8 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had taken steroids or 5-ASA within 7 days or immunosuppressives within 90 days of entry. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 1, 4 and 8 weeks. Patients rated their symptoms on a visual analog scale. A blinded physician provided a global assessment (PGA), with improvement defined as a score of 1 or 2. Endoscopic response was assessed in the most severe segment between 5 and 15cm from the anal verge using a 15-point scale comprising erythema, friability, granularity/ulceration, mucopus and vascularity. Endoscopic improvement was defined as a 5-point reduction in the score and remission as a score &lt; 4. Histology was graded as normal (score 0), inactive (score 1), low-grade activity (score 2) or high-grade activity (score 3). Histologic improvement was defined as a 1-point decrease and remission as a score of 0 or 1 with a 1-point decrease. Clinical remission required a PGA of 1 with endoscopic score &lt; 4 and histologic score 0 or 1 with a 1-point decrease from baseline. Analysis was by intention to treat. All groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics. Adverse events were equal amongst all groups, but there were significantly more dropouts in the placebo group due to "treatment failure." Clinical improvement was achieved by 27%, 67%, 65% and 75% on placebo (n = 70), 1 g 5-ASA (n = 73), 2 g 5-ASA (n = 71) and 4 g 5-ASA (n = 73) groups respectively. Clinical remission was attained by 14%, 47%, 49% and 44%, respectively. Sigmoidoscopic remission was attained by 24%, 59%, 65% and 66%, and histologic remission was achieved by 16%, 42%, 49% and 55%, respectively. All outcomes were significantly better for 5-ASA compared to placebo, but there was no 5-ASA dose response. The authors concluded that 5-ASA enemas were superior to placebo for inducing clinical, endoscopic and histological improvement and remission in mild to moderately active distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kam-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kam 1996</LINK> conducted a randomised, double-blind double-dummy study comparing 4 g 5-ASA enema to oral sulphasalazine 1 g qid administered for 6 weeks in 37 patients with active UC extending 5 to 50 cm from the anal verge and DAI 4 to 9. Patients were excluded if they had had prior bowel resections, diverticulitis, or 5-ASA failure. Oral steroids could be continued if patients had been treated for at least 4 weeks and the dose remained less than 15 mg prednisolone throughout the trial. Immunosuppressives were also continued if they had been used for at least 90 days before study entry and remained at stable doses. The Sutherland DAI <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>, a 7-point clinical global improvement (CGI) scale and a 7-point patient global improvement (PGI) scale were used to assess response. Complete remission was defined as a DAI of 0, rectal bleeding score 0, evacuation frequency score 0, mucosal appearance score 0 and PGI score 0. Demographic characteristics were similar on 5-ASA (n = 19) and sulphasalazine (n = 18); 84% on 5-ASA and 72% on sulphasalazine completed the trial. There was 1 patient lost to follow up and 1 patient in protocol violation in the 5-ASA group. In the sulphasalazine group 3 patients had adverse events (all minor) leading to withdrawal and 2 were lost to follow up. In total, 8 patients on 5-ASA compared to 15 on sulphasalazine experienced minor adverse events (P = 0.02), and 3 patients on sulphasalazine group withdrew from due to adverse events. At 6 weeks, both groups had a significant decrease in the mean DAI score (P &lt; 0.001), although the groups did not differ. CGI scores also improved in both groups but did not differ between groups. The 5-ASA group had significantly better PGI scores than the sulphasalazine group. Complete remission was achieved by 21% on 5-ASA compared to 22% on sulphasalazine. The authors concluded that rectal 5-ASA was as effective as oral sulphasalazine for treating active distal UC with rapid onset and good safety.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1996</LINK> compared 2 g 5-ASA foam to 20 mg prednisolone foam for 4 weeks in 295 patients with mild to moderately active UC distal to the splenic flexure in a randomised, investigator blind trial at 39 centres in the United Kingdom. Oral steroids, rectal steroids or rectal 5-ASA were not permitted within one month of the trial, but oral sulphasalazine was permitted at a stable dose. Symptom diaries were completed at 2 and 4 weeks, and endoscopy was performed at 4 weeks. Clinical remission was defined as 3 or fewer stools per day with no blood. The endoscopic appearance was graded as normal (including minor abnormalities in the vascular pattern), abnormal with loss of vascularity and granularity but no friability, or abnormal with visible bleeding and/or ulceration. Histologic grading was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Rudell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudell 1980</LINK> and remission was defined as a score of 0 if the entry score was greater than 0. Patients on 5-ASA (n = 149) and prednisolone (n = 146) were well matched with respect to sociodemographic characteristics. Clinical remission was achieved by 52% of 5-ASA patients compared to 31% of prednisolone patients (P &lt; 0.001). 5-ASA and prednisolone did not differ for endoscopic (40% versus 31%) or histologic remission (27% versus 21%). Adverse events were uncommon in both groups. The authors concluded that 5-ASA foam enemas were associated with higher clinical remission rates than prednisolone foam enemas, and hypothesized that longer follow up might have demonstrated differences in endoscopic and histological remission.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lemann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lemann 1995</LINK> conducted a 4 week randomised, investigator blinded comparison of budesonide enemas (2.3 mg) with 5-ASA enemas (1 g) in 97 patients with UC distal to the splenic flexure at endoscopy. Oral 5-ASA was continued if at stable dose for 2 weeks before study entry. Patients who had received steroids (oral or rectal) within one month or who had previously failed 5-ASA were excluded. Endoscopic appearance was classified as: normal (score 0); granularity, edema and loss of vascularity (score 1); hyperemia, friability and petechiae (score 2) or ulceration (score 3). Endoscopic remission was defined as a score of 0, and improvement as any reduction from baseline. Histology was assessed according to <LINK REF="REF-Floren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floren 1987</LINK> on a 5-point scale, with remission defined as a score of 1 and improvement as any reduction from baseline. Clinical parameters (stool frequency and rectal bleeding) were assessed as secondary outcomes. Remission was defined as no blood and little or no mucus per rectum. The budesonide group (n = 48) and 5-ASA group (n = 49) were well matched with respect to demographic characteristics. Nine patients in each group were excluded from the per protocol analysis for protocol violation (7 on budesonide, 6 on 5-ASA) or loss to follow-up (2 on budesonide, 3 on 5-ASA). There was 1 serious adverse event in each group, judged not to be related to the study drug. There was no statistically significant difference between budesonide and 5-ASA in rates of endoscopic improvement (76% versus 81%), endoscopic remission (13% versus 13%), histologic improvement (63% versus 67%) or histologic remission (12% versus 20%). Although there was no difference in clinical improvement, clinical remission was achieved by 38% of budesonide patients compared to 60% of 5-ASA patients (P = 0.03). The authors reported that 2 mg budesonide enemas were a good alternative to rectal 5-ASA in patients with active distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 2002</LINK> compared 2 g 5-ASA Mesalazine foam to 4 g 5-ASA liquid enema in patients with UC distal to the splenic flexure but at least 12 cm from the anal verge with clinical activity index (CAI) &gt; 4 in a randomised, investigator blind trial. Patients were excluded if they were presenting with their first flare or had received immunosuppressants or antibiotics for UC. Oral 5-ASA was continued if at stable dose for at least 4 weeks. Clinical and endoscopic assessment were according to <LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at 2 or 4 weeks, defined as a CAI &lt; 2. Other outcomes included clinical improvement (defined as a shift in CAI after 4 weeks) and endoscopic remission defined as EI &lt; 2), histologic change and quality of life (IBDQ). Of 400 patients screened, 266 were suitable and randomised, 133 in each group (2 patients randomised to liquid enema were not treated due to safety concerns). Treatment groups did not differ, except that oral 5-ASA was used by more subjects in the foam group (48.6% versus 43.2%). Tolerability was similar. Adverse events were more common in the foam group. Of those judged not to be minor (3 on foam, 1 on liquid), none was fatal or related to study medication. After 4 weeks, 65% on foam compared to 70% on liquid enema achieved clinical remission and 86% compared to 93% achieved clinical improvement. Endoscopic remission was attained by 38% in both groups. Histologic remission was seen in 46% on foam compared to 50% on liquid enemas. Qualify of life scores were slightly higher in the foam group, but no significance test was reported. The authors concluded that 2 g 5-ASA foam enema is an effective, safe and tolerable treatment for active distal UC, and is equivalent to 4 g 5-ASA liquid enema.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Miner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 2006</LINK> compared enemas containing 120 mg (n = 55) or 240 mg (n = 50) of the antisense oligonucleotide alicaforsen to 5-ASA 4g (n = 54) enemas in 159 patients with mild to moderately active UC extending no more than 50 cm from the anal verge in a randomised, double-blind trial for 6 weeks. Clinical and endoscopic severity was the summation of DAI index scores according <LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>. Eligible patients had a DAI of 4 to 10. Oral 5-ASA and purine anti-metabolites were continued at stable dose, but corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants were not permitted. The primary end point was change in DAI at week 6. Secondary end points included change in DAI at other time points up to week 54, and rates of clinical improvement, clinical remission (DAI &lt; 2, stool frequency &lt;1, rectal bleeding = 0, endoscopy = 0, PAD = 1) and clinical relapse. At week 6 the mean percentage reduction in DAI was 40%, 41% and 50% on 120 mg alicaforsen, 240 mg alicaforsen and 5-ASA respectively (differences not statistically significant). At Week 18 a dose-response was observed with DAI decreases of 43% in the 240 mg alicoforsen group compared to 17% in the 120 mg alicaforsen group. There were a total of 306 adverse events (76 on alicaforsen 240 mg, 113 on alicaforsen 120 mg, 117 on 5-ASA), of which 17 were serious but not drug-related. The authors concluded that rectal alicaforsen was effective for treatment of distal UC and demonstrates a dose response relationship, but was not superior to rectal 5-ASA.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Moller-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 1978</LINK> randomised 30 patients with biopsy-confirmed UC extending no more than 15 cm from the anal verge to receive either 3 g sulphasalazine enema (n = 16) or placebo enema (n = 14) every night for 2 weeks. No other medications were permitted. Clinical assessments and proctoscopies were performed at 1 and 2 weeks with inflammation graded on a predefined 3 grade scale. Treatment response was defined as: Excellent <BR/>(full endoscopic remission with normalized symptoms); good (marked endoscopic improvement with normalized symptoms and/or less blood/mucus in the stool); and none (no endoscopic or symptomatic improvement). Demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar and only 1 patient (on placebo) withdrew due to lack of improvement. No adverse effects were reported. Due to the small sample size the outcomes "Good" and "None" were grouped together for statistical analysis when compared to the outcome "Excellent." At 2 weeks, 75% and 81% of sulphasalazine patients experienced "excellent" endoscopic and symptomatic responses, compared to 21% and 14% of placebo patients. These differences were statistically significant. The authors concluded that sulphasalazine enema was a useful short term treatment in ulcerative proctitis and can be used when oral therapy is not tolerated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1988</LINK> compared 3 g 5-ASA enemas to 30 mg prednisolone enemas in 29 patients with active UC within 20 cm of the anal verge. Sulphasalazine was continued at stable dose but no other medications were permitted, including steroids within one month of enrolment. Patients were randomised to 5-ASA (n = 15) or prednisolone (n = 14) enemas (40 ml) for 28 days, with improvement as the primary outcome. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic activity was assessed blindly using a predefined grading system according to <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Heide-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Heide 1988</LINK> at study entry and 28 days. Decreases of &gt; 3 in endoscopic score, &gt; 2 in clinical score and &gt; 8 in histological score, were considered an improvement. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, sex, disease duration and sulphasalazine therapy. Clinical, endoscopic and histological improvement was achieved by 73%, 73% and 73% at 28 days on 5-ASA compared to 79%, 86% and 57% on prednisolone. Clinical remission, defined as normalization of all variables, was not observed in either group. No adverse events were observed in either group. The authors concluded that 5-ASA enemas were a safe and effective treatment for distal UC and a reasonable alternative to rectal corticosteroids.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1996</LINK> conducted a multicenter randomised double-blind trial comparing 3 mg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) enema (n = 20) with 2 g 5-ASA enema (n = 21) and an enema combination of BDP/5-ASA (3 mg/2 g; n = 19) for 4 weeks in 60 patients with active UC extending less than 20 cm from the anal verge. No corticosteroids or other topical therapies were permitted, but oral sulphasalazine and 5-ASA were continued at stable doses. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic activity was assessed at study entry and 4 weeks according to the <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Heide-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Heide 1988</LINK> scale. Clinical and endoscopic improvement was defined as a decrease in clinical score &gt; 2 and a decrease in endoscopic score &gt; 3. Histologic improvement was defined as a decrease in score &gt; 2. All groups had similar demographics and compliance was greater than 95%. After 4 weeks, clinical improvement was seen in 70%, 76% and 100% of patients receiving BDP, 5-ASA and BDP + 5-ASA respectively. Endoscopic improvement was seen in 75%, 71% and 100%. Endoscopic healing was noted in 30%, 10% and 37%. Histologic improvement was seen in 50%, 48% and 100%. The difference in clinical improvement was statistically significant for the comparison of BDP+ 5-ASA versus BDP. The differences in endoscopic and histologic improvement was statistically significant for both BDP+ 5-ASA versus BDP and BDP+ 5-ASA versus 5-ASA. No adverse events were reported. The authors concluded that combination therapy with BDP + 5-ASA was superior to monotherapy with BDP or 5-ASA for treatment of active distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1981</LINK> compared 2 weeks of treatment with sulphasalazine 3 g enemas (n = 17) or placebo (n = 23) in 40 patients with UC in a double-blind randomised trial. Oral sulphasalazine was continued at stable doses. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic activity was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1966</LINK> as absent, mild, moderate or severe. Improvement and deterioration was defined as a one-grade change in each score. The treatment groups were similar at baseline. Adverse events occurred equally in both groups, and there was one withdrawal on sulphasalazine for non-compliance. At the end of 2 weeks, 65% on sulphasalazine improved compared to 9% on placebo. The authors concluded that sulphasalazine enemas were effective treatment for active UC and should be considered for those intolerant of oral sulphasalazine.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Pokrotneiks-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pokrotneiks 2000</LINK> randomised 111 patients with mild to moderately active UC distal to the splenic flexure to receive placebo (n = 57) or 2 g 5-ASA foam enemas (n = 54) for 6 weeks in a double-blind, parallel-group study. Subjects were required to have a CAI &gt; 3 for proctosigmoiditis and &gt; 4 for left-sided UC, and an Endoscopic Index (EI) &gt; 4. Subjects were excluded if they had used steroids continually for 1 month, immunosuppressants for 3 months, or oral 5-ASA or NSAIDs within 2 weeks of study entry. Clinical and endoscopic activity was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>, and histologic activity according to <LINK REF="REF-Floren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floren 1987</LINK>. Clinical remission was defined as a CAI &lt; 4 with a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline. Endoscopic remission was defined as an EI &lt; 3, and histologic improvement as a 1-point reduction in the histologic score from baseline. The two groups were similar at baseline. Compliance was near 90% for each group and each group had only 1 drop out, but adverse events were more common on placebo. There were 6 serious adverse events, 5 of which occurred in placebo patients and reflected deterioration of UC requiring hospitalization. Analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis. Of patients on 5-ASA, 65% experienced clinical remission, 57% achieved endoscopic remission and 59% had histologic improvement of their disease. This was compared to 40%, 37% and 41% on placebo. CAI scores were reduced by 4.7 and 3.5 points in 5-ASA patients compared to placebo. Differences in rates of clinical and endoscopic remission were statistically significant in favour of 5-ASA. The authors concluded that 5-ASA foam enema was well tolerated and superior to placebo for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Powell_x002d_Tuck-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Powell-Tuck 1986</LINK> conducted a 28 day randomised, double blind trial comparing 1 g (n = 12) and 2 g 5-ASA enemas (n = 13) in 25 patients with active ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. Sulphasalazine was continued at stable dose but no other therapies were permitted. Clinical, endoscopic and histological activity was assessed according to <LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Tuck-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Tuck 1982</LINK> using a scale from 0 to 2. Remission was defined as a clinical score of 0, and an endoscopic score of 0 (non-friable mucosa). The groups were similar at baseline. One patient in the 2 g/day group withdrew for worsening diarrhoea but no other adverse events were noted. At 28 days, according to intention to treat analysis, 58% of those in the 1 g 5-ASA group achieved remission compared to 31% of the 2 g 5-ASA group. This difference was not statistically significant. The authors concluded that 1 g 5-ASA enemas were no less effective than 2 g 5-ASA enemas.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2005</LINK> compared the efficacy of oral multi-matrix (MMx) 5-ASA 1.2 g three times daily to 4 g 5-ASA enemas in 79 patients with mild to moderately active distal UC in a randomised double-blind double-dummy trial for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (CAI &lt; 4) at week 8 according to <LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>, with endoscopic remission (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK> EI &lt; 2) and histologic remission (<LINK REF="REF-Floren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floren 1987</LINK>) as secondary endpoints. Patients were enrolled if they were at least 18 years of age and had a CAI &gt; 6 with disease extending at least 15 cm from the anal verge but not past the splenic flexure. No steroids or immunosuppressive agents were permitted within 4 weeks of study entry. The treatment groups were similar at baseline. There were 20 patient withdrawals (8 on oral MMx and 12 on 5-ASA enema) but no severe adverse events. Clinical remission was achieved by 60% in the oral MMx group compared to 49% of the 5-ASA enema group, with no statistically significant difference. Endoscopic and histologic remission was achieved by 45% and 15% of the oral MMx group, compared to 36% and 8% of the rectal 5-ASA group. The authors concluded that oral MMx 5-ASA was comparable to 5-ASA enema for inducing remission of distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Safdi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Safdi 1997</LINK> reported a 6 week randomised, double-blind double-dummy comparison of oral 5-ASA (800 mg tid) versus rectal 5-ASA enema (4 g) versus combination therapy in patients with active UC extending between 5 and 50 cm from the anal verge. Eligible patients had a DAI between 4 and 10 at study entry (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>). Those with previous bowel resections or who had used other topical or oral UC therapies within 1 week were excluded. Outcomes included clinical and endoscopic parameters of the DAI, a clinical global improvement (CGI) scale and a patient global improvement (PGI) scale. The treatment groups were similar at baseline. Completion rates were 82%, 94and and 95% for oral (n = 22), enema (n = 18) and combination therapy (n = 20) groups. Three patients in the oral 5-ASA group withdrew from the study, 1 patient in the enema group withdrew due to relapse and 1 patient in the combination therapy group was removed from the study due to a protocol violation. Adverse events were reported by 41%, 17% and 45% in the oral 5-ASA, rectal 5-ASA and combination groups, respectively. Most were minor (e.g. headache in 10%). Five were severe (2 oral, 1 rectal, 2 combination) but resolved by study completion. At 6 weeks, the mean decrease in DAI was 5.2 on combination therapy, 4.4 on enema therapy and 3.9 on oral therapy (no significant difference). Clinical improvement (cessation of rectal bleeding) was achieved by 89%, 69% and 46%, with a statistically significant difference between combination and oral therapy. Combination therapy was also superior to oral therapy for improving CGI scores at all visits and PGI scores at 3 weeks. The authors concluded that combination therapy with oral and rectal 5-ASA was more effective for treating mild to moderately active distal UC than either oral or rectal therapy alone.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Senagore-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Senagore 1992</LINK> randomised 45 patients with UC distal to the splenic flexure to treatment with hydrocortisone enemas (100 mg od; n = 12), 5-ASA enemas (4 g od; n = 19) or short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) enemas (bid; n = 14) for 6 weeks. No other therapies for UC were permitted. Outcomes included endoscopic and histologic activity. Endoscopic activity was scored as: normal (score 0); mucosal erythema, loss of vascularity and slight edema (score 1); contact friability (score 2); superficial with small amounts of mocopulent discharge (score 3); and large amounts of mucopurulent discharge with severe ulceration (score 4). Histology was scored as: normal (score 0); trace inflammation (score 1); mild inflammation (score 2); moderate inflammation (score 3) or severe inflammation (score 4). Treatment groups were similar at baseline. A large number of patients in all treatments groups experienced resolution of clinical symptoms and improved endoscopic and histologic scores. "Recovery" occurred in 83%, 89% and 86% of patients in the hydrocortisone, 5-ASA and SCFA groups respectively. A cost minimization analysis showed a significant saving with SCFA therapy. The authors concluded that SCFA enemas are an effective and cost-saving therapy for distal UC, and that a larger multicenter trial is necessary to confirm these results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK> randomised 153 patients with UC extending 5 to 50 cm from the anal verge to receive either 4 g 5-ASA (n = 76) enemas or placebo enemas (n = 77) for 6 weeks in a double-blind trial. The minimum DAI at entry was 3. Oral sulphasalazine and steroids (&lt; 30 mg) were permitted if their dose had remained stable for 4 weeks but patient using rectal steroids were excluded. Clinical and endoscopic activity was assessed based on a predefined 12-point DAI with up to 3 points for each of: stool frequency; rectal bleeding; mucosal appearance; and physician rating of disease activity. Clinical, endoscopic and histologic activity was assessed at study entry, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Subjects who deteriorated at 3 weeks were withdrawn and enrolled in a separate protocol. Treatment groups were similar at baseline. One subject dropped out early for non-compliance and was replaced. A further 20 subjects (6 in 5-ASA, 14 in placebo) dropped out due to poor response. Few adverse events were reported. Improvement in disease activity was achieved by 63% on 5-ASA compared to 29% on placebo. The DAI score was reduced by 55% in 5-ASA patients compared to 22% in placebo patients. Both differences were statistically significant. Treatment response was not influenced by co-treatment with oral sulphasalazine. The authors concluded that topical 5-ASA was an effective treatment for active distal UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Vecchi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vecchi 2001</LINK> conducted a randomised multi-centre double-dummy trial comparing oral 5-ASA (4 g/day) with combined oral 5-ASA (2 g/day) and 5-ASA enemas (2 g/day) in 130 patients with mild to moderate UC, as defined by CAI between 4 and 12 (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>). A total of 130 patients were enrolled, 67 were randomised to receive oral Mesalazine and 63 were allocated to receive a combined oral and topical therapy. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as CAI &lt; 4, and clinical improvement, defined as a decrease in CAI &gt; 50%. A secondary endpoint was endoscopic remission, defined as an EI &lt; 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>). No significant difference was observed between oral 5-ASA and combined oral/rectal 5-ASA for clinical remission (82% versus 87%) or endoscopic remission (58% versus 71%). The authors concluded that oral 5-ASA was as effective as combining oral with rectal 5-ASA for inducing remission in patients with mild to moderate UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1987</LINK> reported a randomised, double-blind 6 week trial comparing 5-ASA suppositories (500 mg tid, n = 14) to placebo (n = 13) in 27 patients with active UC extending less than 15 cm form the anal verge. Eligible patients had DAI greater than 3 on a 12 point scale at entry. Patients were excluded if they had taken 4-ASA or 5-ASA within 48 hours or rectal steroids within 2 weeks of study entry. Oral sulphasalazine and prednisone were permitted at stable dose. A subset of patients also received technetium-labelled 5-ASA to assess drug distribution. Response to treatment was assessed by change in the DAI and by endoscopy at 3 and 6 weeks on a predefined scale. Remission was defined as a DAI score of 0 . The treatment groups were similar at baseline. There were 2 withdrawals, both in the placebo group, 1 dropped out and the other had Salmonella. After 6 weeks, the mean DAI in the treatment group was 0.4 +/- 0.9, compared to 5.4 +/- 3.4 in the placebo group. Remission was achieved by 79% on 5-ASA compared to 8% on placebo after 6 weeks. No adverse events were reported. Technetium labelled 5-ASA remained in the rectum and sigmoid colon in all patients studied. The authors concluded that 5-ASA suppositories were safe, well tolerated and effective for distal UC. They also suggested that 5-ASA suppositories can be used as first line therapy for UC, or for UC resistant to oral sulphasalazine or prednisone.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 08:53:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>This systematic review confirms the efficacy of rectal 5-ASA for inducing remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and updates previously published meta analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) with an increased sample size and Cochrane Collaboration formatting. Among 10 placebo-controlled trials, rectal 5-ASA was superior to placebo for symptomatic, endoscopic and histological improvement or remission. Rectal 5-ASA was also superior to rectal corticosteroids for inducing symptomatic remission, with favourable non significant trends for endoscopic and histologic outcomes.</P>
<P>No 5-ASA dose response relationship was observed, with no significant differences in outcomes among 5-ASA dose strata. This confirms observations made by individual trials, and supports the poor dose response seen in clinical trials of oral 5-ASA for induction of remission. However, the absence of a dose response must be reconciled with observations that the combination of oral and rectal 5-ASA appears to be more effective than either given as monotherapy, even in subjects with extensive UC (<LINK REF="STD-Marteau-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecchi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vecchi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Safdi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Safdi 1997</LINK>). One possible explanation is that, rather than increasing local drug concentrations, combination therapy promotes more homogeneous drug distribution across affected segments in patients with active disease. This would suggest that geographic coverage is a more important determinant of response than local drug concentration. More studies comparing rectal monotherapy to combination oral and rectal 5-ASA are needed (<LINK REF="STD-Safdi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Safdi 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Within the definition of distal ulcerative colitis are patients with limited proctitis and those with disease extending as far as the splenic flexure. We planned a priori to conduct subgroup analyses of efficacy by proximal disease margin but were unable to extract sufficient subject-level information. Accordingly, it is unclear whether patients with proctitis and proctosigmoiditis respond equally to rectal 5-ASA therapy. Further studies comparing oral, rectal and combination therapy with adequate power to assess such subgroups should be considered.</P>
<P>No consistent difference in efficacy was noted among the various rectal 5-ASA formulations (liquid enema, foam enema or suppository) but comparative data are limited. This is consistent with scintigraphic studies showing that suppositories distribute drug to the rectum, foam enemas to the sigmoid colon and liquid enemas to the splenic flexure. However, it should be noted that most trials evaluating suppositories restricted enrolment to patients with only proctitis, while studies of foam and liquid enemas more often included patients with more extensive left-sided disease. <LINK REF="STD-Farup-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Farup 1995</LINK> found suppositories to be superior to foam enemas in patients with proctitis and also to be preferred by patients. For patients with disease extending more proximally, foam and liquid enemas appear equally effective but patients generally prefer foam because of easier administration and more comfortable retention. While 5-ASA foam is arguably the preferred first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderately active proctosigmoiditis, it is not available in all jurisdictions.</P>
<P>A considerable challenge to producing summary evaluations of efficacy data in active ulcerative colitis is the heterogeneity of outcome definitions across clinical trials. For quantitative pooling of results, the original authors' definitions of outcomes were accepted, if they were established a priori. With sufficient individual subject data, it would have been preferable to transpose each trial's outcomes to common definitions of response and remission. This would likely have reduced inter-study heterogeneity and improved the precision of the point estimates of response and remission. The standardization of outcome measurement in clinical trials for ulcerative colitis is required (<LINK REF="REF-Cooney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haens 2007</LINK>), to facilitate quantitative pooling and comparisons of efficacy across therapies.</P>

<P>Rectal 5-ASA should be considered the first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderately active distal ulcerative colitis who are willing to use rectal therapies and who do not have clinically important contraindications to 5-ASA therapy. The optimal total daily dose and dose frequency remains to be defined.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-03 09:53:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Future research should consider further evaluation of the relative efficacies of rectal 5-ASA delivery systems, and better comparison of efficacy across patient subgroups defined by proximal disease margin and disease activity. There is a strong need for consensus standardization of outcome measurements for clinical trials in ulcerative colitis.</P>
