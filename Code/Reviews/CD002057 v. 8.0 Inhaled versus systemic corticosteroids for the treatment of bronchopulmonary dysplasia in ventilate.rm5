<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator-dependent preterm neonates with birth weight &#8804; 1500 g or gestational age &#8804; 32 weeks after 7 days of life on the incidence of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' corrected postmenstrual age.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Preterm babies (babies born before term, 40 weeks pregnancy) often need breathing (ventilator) support. Babies who need invasive (placing a breathing tube in the wind pipe) mechanical breathing support for a prolonged period often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as requirement for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age). It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause. Corticosteroid drugs reduce inflammation and swelling in the lungs, but can have serious side effects. Corticosteroid use has been associated with cerebral palsy (motor problem) and developmental delay. Inhaling steroids, so that the drug reaches the lungs directly, has been tried as a way to limit adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>23 February 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>All three included trials were randomised, but the blinding of intervention and outcome measurement varied. Data from two trials (enrolling 139 infants) were combined as they enrolled infants between 12 and 21 days of age, but data from one trial (enrolling 292 infants) were reported separately because researchers randomised infants aged less than 72 hours. The timing when the outcomes were measured varied among studies so it was not appropriate to combine some results. In one study all deaths that occurred were reported from the time babies were randomised not from when treatment started, hence there was a greater number of babies who died in that study.</P>
<P>One study received grant support and the industry provided Aerochambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the same study. No conflict of interest was identified.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence from two studies in 370 infants, who were randomised between 12 and 21 days of age and who contributed data to the primary outcome of this review, showed that inhaled steroids administered after 7 days of age compared with systemic steroids did not decrease the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Evidence from the single study in which infants were randomised at less than 72 hours of age did not show difference the incidence of death or BPD.</P>
<P>Evidence from three studies in 431 infants contributing to secondary outcomes showed that inhaled steroids administered after seven days of age compared with systemic steroids did not significantly alter the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen supplementation, length of hospital stay, intraventricular haemorrhage grade III-IV, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleed, retinopathy of prematurity stage &gt; 3, culture-proven sepsis or the incidence of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Adverse event profiles did not differ for inhaled versus systemic steroids but some potential complications of steroid treatment have not been reported. More research is needed to show whether any form of routine use of steroids results in overall health improvements for babies at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence quality (according to GRADE criteria) was moderate to low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-12 10:51:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a review published in 2012. A related review "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates" has been updated as well. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious and common problem among very low birth weight infants, despite the use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant therapy to decrease the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, corticosteroids have been widely used to treat or prevent BPD. However, the use of systemic steroids has been associated with serious short- and long-term adverse effects. Administration of corticosteroids topically through the respiratory tract may result in beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with fewer undesirable systemic side effects.<BR/>

<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 23 February 2017), Embase (1980 to 23 February 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 23 February 2017).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-04 09:38:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three trials that involved a total of 431 participants which compared inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids to treat BPD. No new trials were included for the 2017 update. </P>
<P>Although one study randomised infants at &lt; 72 hours (N = 292), treatment started when infants were aged &gt; 15 days. In this larger study, deaths were included from the point of randomisation and before treatment started. Two studies (N = 139) randomised and started treatment at 12 to 21 days.</P>
<P>Two trials reported non-significant differences between groups for the primary outcome: incidence of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among all randomised infants. Estimates for the largest trial were Relative risk (RR) 1.04 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.26), Risk difference (RD) 0.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.15); (moderate-quality evidence). Estimates for the other trial reporting the primary outcome were RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.05), RD -0.06 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.05); (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes that included data from all three trials showed no significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen, length of hospital stay, or the incidence of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleed, retinopathy of prematurity or culture-proven sepsis moderate- to low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>In a subset of 75 surviving infants who were enrolled from the United Kingdom and Ireland, there were no significant differences in developmental outcomes at seven years of age between groups (moderate-quality evidence). One study received grant support and the industry provided aerochambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the same study. No conflict of interest was identified.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-08 02:58:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no evidence that inhaled corticosteroids confer net advantages over systemic corticosteroids in the management of ventilator-dependent preterm infants. There was no evidence of difference in effectiveness or adverse event profiles for inhaled versus systemic steroids. </P>
<P>A better delivery system guaranteeing selective delivery of inhaled steroids to the alveoli might result in beneficial clinical effects without increasing adverse events. </P>
<P>To resolve this issue, studies are needed to identify the risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for administration of these medications. The long-term effects of inhaled steroids, with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcomes, should be addressed in future studies.</P>

<P>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious and common problem among very low birth weight infants despite the use of antenatal steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2017</LINK>) and postnatal surfactant therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bahadue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadue 2012</LINK>) to decrease the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome.

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-28 13:01:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harkavy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazzi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazzi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1992</LINK>) and systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>) have demonstrated that among infants with BPD, treatment with systemic corticosteroids facilitates extubation and improves respiratory system compliance. Marked heterogeneity regarding the dose and duration of dexamethasone administration has been noted among trials. However, corticosteroids appear to have little effect on the duration of supplemental oxygen, duration of hospitalisation or mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harkavy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazzi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazzi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1992</LINK>). There are concerns regarding the short- and long-term side effects of systemic steroids in this population. These include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, enhanced catabolism and growth failure, nephrocalcinosis, poor bone mineralization and susceptibility to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential effects on brain growth and neurodevelopment are most alarming. Animal models (rat and rhesus monkey) at a similar stage of ontogeny to the human fetus have shown that steroids permanently affect brain cell division, differentiation and myelination, as well as the ontogeny of cerebral cortical development (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weichsel-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weichsel 1977</LINK>). These effects are long-lasting and associated with decreased head circumference and neuromotor abnormalities. Several follow-up studies of postnatal systemic corticosteroid therapy in preterm infants have shown higher incidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in surviving dexamethasone-treated infants (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shea-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shea 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Theoretically, the use of inhaled corticosteroids may allow for beneficial effects on the pulmonary system without concomitant high systemic concentrations and less risk of adverse effects. Results from a large multicentre study of early use of inhaled steroids concluded that among extremely preterm infants, BPD incidence was lower among those who received early inhaled budesonide than among those who received placebo, but the advantage may have been gained at the expense of increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2015</LINK>). Results from this study have been incorporated in a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK>) and a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2016</LINK> concluded that "Very preterm infants appear to benefit from inhaled corticosteroids with reduced risk for BPD and no effect on death, other morbidities, or adverse events. Data on long-term respiratory, growth, and developmental outcomes are eagerly awaited". <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK> summarised their findings as: "There is increasing evidence from the trials reviewed that early administration of inhaled steroids to very low birth weight neonates is effective in reducing the incidence of death or CLD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among either all randomised infants or among survivors. Even though there is statistical significance, the clinical relevance is of question as the upper CI limit for the outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age is infinity. The long-term follow-up results of the <LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2015</LINK> study may affect the conclusions of this review. Further studies are needed to identify the risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of these medications. Studies need to address both the short- and long-term benefits and adverse effects of inhaled steroids with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome".</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that a Cochrane Review by <LINK REF="REF-Onland-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2017b</LINK> concluded: "Despite the fact that some studies reported a modulating effect of treatment regimens in favour of higher-dosage regimens on the incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment, recommendations on the optimal type of corticosteroid, the optimal dosage, or the optimal timing of initiation for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants cannot be made based on current level of evidence. A well-designed large RCT is urgently needed to establish the optimal systemic postnatal corticosteroid dosage regimen".</P>
<P>Apart from studies included in this review, we are not aware of any other direct comparisons of early use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-04 12:03:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause of BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Nelin-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelin 2017</LINK>). As part of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of early inhaled beclomethasone therapy, <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK> measured interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) concentrations in tracheal aspirates as markers of pulmonary inflammation. Beclomethasone-treated infants with moderately elevated baseline IL-8 levels received less subsequent systemic glucocorticoid therapy and had a lower incidence of BPD than non treated infants. <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK> and co-authors concluded that early-inhaled beclomethasone therapy was associated with a reduction in pulmonary inflammation after one week of therapy. Corticosteroid drugs when given orally or intravenously reduces this inflammation in the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Nelin-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelin 2017</LINK>). Corticosteroid use has been associated with cerebral palsy and developmental delay (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-_x0026_-CPS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP &amp; CPS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelin-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelin 2017</LINK>). In a retrospective study of infants born at &lt; 29 weeks PMA and assessed at 18 to 21 months corrected age it was found that exposure to inhaled steroids was not associated with increased odds of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2017</LINK>). However, in the same study systemic steroids use before 4 weeks of age was associated with significantly worse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2017</LINK>). It is important to minimize exposure to the potentially harmful effects of corticosteroids, particularly on the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2017</LINK>).</P>

<P>Cochrane Reviews have addressed the use of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention or treatment of BPD or chronic lung disease. These include reviews of the early use (&lt; 8 days) of systemic postnatal corticosteroids to prevent chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014</LINK>) and the late use (&gt; 7 days) of systemic postnatal corticosteroids for chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other Cochrane Reviews address the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease. <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK> reviewed the effects of early administration of inhaled corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates and <LINK REF="REF-Onland-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2017a</LINK> reviewed the late use (&#8805; 7 days) of inhaled corticosteroids to reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.</P>
<P>Cochrane Reviews have also compared systemic and inhaled corticosteroids. <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012</LINK> compared the use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates, and the use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of corticosteroids for other indications in neonates including intravenous dexamethasone to facilitate extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>), corticosteroids for the treatment of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2011</LINK>) and corticosteroids for the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2003</LINK>) have been assessed in Cochrane Reviews.</P>
<P>In statements released by the European Association of Perinatal Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 2001a</LINK>), American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 2010</LINK>) and the Canadian Pediatric Society (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferies 2012</LINK>), routine use of systemic dexamethasone for the prevention or treatment of BPD is not recommended. These recommendations were based on concerns regarding short and long-term complications, especially cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>Thus, alternatives to systemic corticosteroids that may have fewer adverse consequences need to be investigated. Administration of corticosteroids topically through the respiratory tract might result in beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with fewer undesirable systemic side effects.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator-dependent very low birth weight neonates of 1500 g or less after the first week of life, for the treatment of evolving BPD. This is an update of our review last published in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012a</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) primary outcomes: death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age for infants randomised at &lt; 72 hours of age and for infants randomised between 12 and 21 days of age. For secondary outcomes we included infants randomised at &lt; 72 hours or between 12 and 21 days; BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; hyperglycaemia; hypertension. For infants randomised at &lt; 72 hours of age we included the following outcomes at 7 years of age: general conceptual ability (GCA); moderate/severe disability; death or moderate/severe disability; systolic blood pressure &gt; 95th percentile; diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95th percentile; and ever diagnosed as asthmatic.</P>
<P>Three authors (VS, SS, AO) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of these outcomes. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK> to create &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; tables to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>

Of 142 infants randomised to the delayed selective budesonide group, 33 received a full course, 21 received a partial course and 88 babies did not receive budesonide. Of 150 infants randomised to the delayed selective dexamethasone group, 35 received a complete course, 25 received a partial course and 90 infants did not receive dexamethasone. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The primary outcome was death or oxygen dependency at 36 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included death or major cerebral abnormality, duration of oxygen treatment, and complications of preterm birth. Long-term outcomes at 7 years of age were assessed in a sample from the UK and Ireland by assessors blinded to the treatment assignments.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> compared inhaled beclomethasone, either 400 or 800 µg/d, to intravenous dexamethasone in preterm infants dependent on conventional mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen at two weeks of age. The study included 78 preterm infants with birth weight &#8804; 1500 g, gestational age &#8804; 30 weeks and ventilatory dependence at 12 to 21 days of age with rate &gt; 15/min and FiO&#8322; &gt; 0.30 with a persistence of these ventilator settings for a minimum of 72 hours. Infants on high frequency ventilation were ineligible for inclusion in the study. Infants were excluded from the study if they had major congenital malformations, culture-proven sepsis, hypertension or hyperglycaemia needing treatment, or persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Infants were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: inhaled beclomethasone at 400 µg/d or 800 µg/d, or intravenous dexamethasone. Inhaled beclomethasone was continued until extubation. Post-extubation the same dose was continued for another 48 hours. After that, the dose was halved every other day for six days, after which the steroids were stopped. Based on our inclusion criteria (to include all studies regardless of dosage of inhaled steroids), and because there was no significant difference in the effects of the two different doses, the two inhaled beclomethasone groups in <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> were combined to form one group in the present review. Intravenous dexamethasone was given as a 42 day tapering course starting with 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1985</LINK>). Cross-over from either of the inhaled beclomethasone groups to intravenous dexamethasone was allowed if after four to five days of inhaled beclomethasone, the infant's ventilator and oxygen support had not decreased and the attending neonatologist felt that the infant could benefit from intravenous dexamethasone. It was reported that 18 infants from the inhaled steroid group crossed over to systemic dexamethasone. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed by the investigators. Outcome measures included adverse effects including sepsis, hypertension and hyperglycaemia; short-term ventilatory requirements, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, length of stay in the hospital and need for respiratory support at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Deaths at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age were not reported. For infants completing a 10 day course of either inhaled or intravenous steroids, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was done two weeks after completion of the steroid course.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rozycki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rozycki 2003</LINK> enrolled 61 preterm infants with birth weights between 650 g and 2000 g who at 14 days of age were at significant risk of developing moderate to severe BPD (defined as the need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen) with x-ray changes beyond 28 days of life. Infants with culture-proven sepsis and who were receiving FiO&#8322; of &#8805; 0.30 were eligible if they had a ventilatory index (10,000/ventilator rate x peak pressure x pCO&#8322;) of &lt; 0.8. Infants without previous sepsis were eligible if the ventilatory index was &lt; 0.51. Infants meeting these criteria had a 75% risk of developing moderate-severe BPD. Infants with the following were excluded: pre-existing hyperglycaemia with blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL for &gt; 24 hours, hypertension with systolic pressures &gt; 70 to 90 mm Hg, depending on birth weight, surgery within previous seven days, active bacterial infection unless repeat blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid cultures were sterile after 72 hours of antibiotics, thrombocytopenia with platelet count &lt; 100,000, any gastrointestinal bleeding within the previous seven days, significant weaning from ventilator support in the previous three days and previous exposure to postnatal steroids. Eligibility was determined at 14 days of age but the study could be delayed up to six days while awaiting resolution of infections. Infants were randomised to the following four groups: Group A: aerosol placebo-systemic dexamethasone; Group B: high beclomethasone-systemic placebo; Group C: medium beclomethasone-systemic placebo; and Group D: low beclomethasone-systemic placebo. Those receiving aerosol steroids who remained ventilator-dependent after seven days were switched to standard 42-day tapering doses of systemic dexamethasone. The primary outcome variable was extubation within the first seven days of the study. Secondary outcome measures included: changes in ventilatory settings and oxygen delivery over the first seven days, the incidence of hypertension, hyperglycaemia, infection and growth.</P>

<P>For the primary outcome death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age data from <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK> were reported separately as they randomised infants &lt; 72 hours of age. <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> reported on the primary outcome but enrolled infants between 12 to 21 days of age. <LINK REF="STD-Rozycki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rozycki 2003</LINK> did not report on the primary outcome. Data from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozycki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rozycki 2003</LINK>) were combined for secondary outcomes as treatment started in infants &gt; 7 days old. The period of measurement of outcomes varied between <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> making combination of results inappropriate. This may possibly explain differences in the incidence of adverse events such as mortality. <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK> counted deaths from &lt; 72 hours onwards and <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> counted deaths from 12 to 21 days onwards. This means that in <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK>, all deaths &lt; 72 hours were attributed to the randomised treatment policy, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK>, only deaths from 12 to 21 days were so attributed. Looking at the control event rate we see what we would expect - a much higher death rate in <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK> than in <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK> (death at 36 weeks' was 33/150 in <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK> and 0/27 in <LINK REF="STD-Suchomski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suchomski 2002</LINK>). Similar explanations could be provided for the other outcomes of interest. Due to these concerns, aggregation of data from the two trials was not performed when outcomes included deaths.</P>

<P>We are not aware of any potential biases in our review process. One author (HH) is the first author of an included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK>). That study was assessed by the other three authors (AO, SS, VS).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-27 15:50:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no evidence that inhaled steroids confer any net advantages over systemic steroids in the management of ventilator-dependent preterm infants. Systemic steroids given late (after 1 week) suggest that late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>). However, systemic steroids, especially dexamethasone given early (&lt; 7 days of age), are associated with an increase in abnormal neurological exam findings and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014</LINK>). Further studies with particular attention on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes need to be performed before delayed steroids, either inhaled or systemic, can be confirmed as safe for treatment of evolving BPD in preterm infants. Follow-up studies are extremely important. A subset of surviving infants from the OSECT study (<LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001</LINK>) have been followed to seven years of age and the results are included in this updated review.</P>
<P>A major concern with studies of inhaled steroid therapy is uncertainty regarding drug delivery and deposition of steroids in the oropharynx and peripheral airways. Numerous factors affect drug delivery and deposition including numbers of particles in the respirable range, delivery technique (use of a metered dose inhaler with or without a spacer), nebuliser (jet or ultrasonic) and the presence or absence of an endotracheal tube. Previous reports have shown that the amount of aerosol delivery varies from 0.4% to 14% based on the technique used (<LINK REF="REF-Arnon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 1992</LINK>). The delayed onset of activity (<LINK REF="STD-Dimitriou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dimitriou 1997</LINK>) and a similar risk profile of inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK>) suggests that effects may be secondary to systemic absorption.</P>
<P>Inhaled steroids are believed to be less effective compared to systemic steroids. The drug type, dosage and delivery methods may be inadequate. More refinements in the inhalational drug delivery system guaranteeing selective delivery in the alveoli and smaller airways may improve the clinical efficacy and decrease the side effect profile of inhaled steroids.</P>
<P>In the present review, there is no evidence of difference in effectiveness or side effect profiles for inhaled versus systemic steroids. A better delivery system or higher dose of inhaled steroids may result in equivalence of effectiveness for the two modes of administration, but may also show evidence of side effects. To resolve this issue, studies are needed to identify the risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of these medications.</P>

<P>To date, only three studies reporting on 431 infants have been published. The quality of the evidence based on GRADE was moderate to low. Larger high quality studies are needed to identify the effectiveness of inhaled steroids versus systemic steroids. The risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of steroids needs to be assessed. Studies are needed to address the long-term effects of inhaled steroids, with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome. We are not aware of any ongoing trials.</P>

<P>There is no published protocol. In this 2017 update the primary outcome was changed to death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. The title was changed from "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants" to "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants" to reflect this change. These changes were made following recommendations from the Editorial team so that different reviews on the topic of postnatal steroids would use the same primary outcome and the same nomenclature. These changes necessitated changes to the secondary outcomes that were listed in the previous update of the review.</P>

<P>570 infants from 47 neonatal intensive care units worldwide (UK, Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Poland, Israel, Singapore, UAE) were enrolled. Inclusion criteria: Gestational age &lt; 30 weeks, postnatal age &lt; 72 hours and need for mechanical ventilation and inspired FiO&#8322; &gt; 30%. Delayed selective treatment was started if infants needed mechanical ventilation and &gt; 30% FiO&#8322; for &gt; 15 days. Infants of 30 - 31 weeks GA could also be included if they needed &gt; 50% FiO&#8322;.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: congenital lethal anomalies, severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) and proven systemic infection before entry. A strong suspicion of infection, uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycaemia were considered to be indications to postpone trial entry until they resolved, provided that this occurred within 72 hours of birth.</P>
<P>The trial had factorial design and a similar number of infants was allocated to each group. Group 1 received early (&lt; 72 hours) dexamethasone (N = 135); group 2 received delayed (&gt; 15 days) dexamethasone (N = 150); group 3 received early budesonide (N = 143); Group 4 received delayed selective budesonide<BR/>(N = 142).</P>

<P>1. Dexamethasone was administered IV or orally in initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days, followed by 0.25 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days, then 0.10 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and finally 0.05 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days for a total of 12 days of treatment.</P>
<P>2. Budesonide was administered using a metered dose inhaler (200 µg/puff; Pulmicort, Astra Draco, Lund, Sweden) connected to spacing device (Aerochamber MV 15; Trudell Medical, Canada). The aero chamber was a rigid, clear plastic cylinder, 11 by 4.1 cm with an approximate capacity of 145 mL. After endotracheal suctioning, the metered dose inhaler was shaken and inserted into the spacing chamber. The spacer was then filled with 100% oxygen and the infant's FiO&#8322; was increased by 20%. The aero chamber was connected into the ventilatory circuit and manual inflations were given through the chamber using an inflatable bag. Budesonide was administered as soon as chest wall movements were established. A 500 to 1000 g infant was given 2 puffs twice daily and 1000 to 1500 g infant was given 3 puffs twice daily. The puffs were given one at a time, activating metered dose inhaler at end expiration and allowing 10 breaths after each activation. After each administration, the chamber was removed from the ventilator circuit and the infant was reconnected to the ventilator at the previous settings. The duration of budesonide treatment was up to 12 days provided the infant remained intubated. If the infant was extubated before 12 days budesonide was discontinued</P>

<P>The study was performed double blind in 11 centres, and in these centres placebo metered dose inhalers and intravenous saline were used to mask treatment allocation. The study design was open rather than double-blind because some clinicians wanted to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics or H&#8322; blockers such as cimetidine or ranitidine to infants receiving dexamethasone. However, in 11 centres, the trial was conducted double-blind, and in these centres placebo metered dose inhalers and intravenous saline were used to mask treatment allocation</P>
<P>This study was supported by a grant from Action Research, United Kingdom. Trudell Medical, London Ontario, Canada supplied Aerochambers, and Astra, Draco, Lund, Sweden supplied the metered dose inhalers (MDIs) of budesonide and placebo.</P>

The intravenous dexamethasone group (N = 27) received a 42 day tapering course (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1985</LINK>), starting with 0.5 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours. Cross over from either of the inhaled beclomethasone groups to intravenous dexamethasone was allowed if, after 4 to 5 days of inhaled beclomethasone, the infant's ventilator and oxygen support had not decreased and the attending neonatologist felt that the infant might benefit from intravenous dexamethasone.</P>
<P>3. All data were analysed according to original group assignment.</P>

<P>1. Primary outcome measures: hypertension or hyperglycaemia needing treatment or culture positive sepsis.</P>
<P>2. Other outcome variables: ventilatory settings, specifically rate, mean airway pressure (MAP), peak inspiratory pressure, positive end expiratory pressure, and supplemental oxygen requirement every 6 hours daily on all enrolled patients starting from 5 days before initiation of steroid therapy and daily thereafter, until extubation. After extubation, the supplemental oxygen was recorded daily until patient was discharged or supplemental oxygen was discontinued.</P>
<P>3. The occurrence of the following was also recorded: intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, GI bleed and death.</P>
<P>4. For infants who completed at least a 10 day course of either inhaled or intravenous steroids, an ACTH stimulation test was done 2 weeks after completion of steroid course. The test was completed in 24 neonates and the morning cortisol levels were noted before and one hour after intravenous bolus of 36 µg/kg synthetic ACTH (Cortrosyn, Organon, West Orange, NJ).</P>

<P>Sample size was determined by assuming a rate of adverse effects (as defined by sepsis or hyperglycaemia or hypertension requiring treatment) of 80% in intravenous steroid-treated infants.

<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation, and the blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved any disagreement by discussion. We added this information to the table Characteristics of included studies. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the risk of bias table:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. High risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</P>
<P>b. Low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>b. High risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. High risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk;</P>
<P>b. High risk;</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
