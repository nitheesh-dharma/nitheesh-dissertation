<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:21:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After a stroke, people with high levels of sugar in their blood have increased mortality regardless of their age, how severe the stroke was, or what type of stroke they had. Insulin can reduce blood sugar levels. We do not know what the optimal level of blood sugar should be after a stroke. We searched for trials that compared usual care with intensive insulin treatment (trying to keep blood sugar levels within the normal range of 4 to 7.5 mmol/L) after stroke. We found 11 trials involving 1583 participants. Trying to keep the blood sugar level within a tight range immediately after a stroke did not improve the outcomes of neurological deficit and dependency. It did, however, significantly increase the chance of experiencing very low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which can be harmful and can cause brain damage and death. On balance, the trials did not show any benefit from intensive control of blood sugar levels after stroke.<BR/>

<P>We included 11 RCTs involving 1583 participants (791 participants in the intervention group and 792 in the control group). We found that there was no difference between the treatment and control groups in the outcomes of death or dependency (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23) or final neurological deficit (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.01). The rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher in the intervention group (OR 14.6, 95% CI 6.6 to 32.2). In the subgroup analyses of diabetes mellitus (DM) versus non-DM, we found no difference for the outcomes of death and disability or neurological deficit.

<P>After updating the results of our previous review, we found that the administration of intravenous insulin with the objective of maintaining serum glucose within a specific range in the first hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide benefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit and significantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes. Specifically, those people whose glucose levels were maintained within a tighter range with intravenous insulin experienced a greater risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia than those people in the control group.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:22:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Hyperglycaemia (where the blood glucose concentration is greater than 6.1 mmol/L) on admission to hospital is common after acute ischaemic stroke and occurs in up to two-thirds of all patients (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1999</LINK>). There has been much debate over the years as to whether hyperglycaemia in people with acute stroke is the result of a stress response (<LINK REF="REF-Candelise-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1994</LINK>), poor glycaemic control in people with diabetes, or unrecognised diabetes. Regardless, the majority of clinical trials have concluded that hyperglycaemia predicts increased stroke mortality independently of age, stroke severity, or stroke type (<LINK REF="REF-Capes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melamed-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melamed 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1997</LINK>). However, the uncertainty over whether hyperglycaemia worsens prognosis through the augmentation of acute brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kooten-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kooten 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1997</LINK>) or is merely a physiological response to acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Murros-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murros 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murros-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murros 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 1988</LINK>) still remains.</P>
<P>Hyperglycaemia has been shown to have a deleterious effect on ischaemic brain tissue in numerous animal studies, and many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-de-Courten_x002d_Myers-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Courten-Myers 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pulsinelli-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulsinelli 1982</LINK>). One of the most consistent findings is the association between hyperglycaemia and cerebral acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Pulsinelli-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulsinelli 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehncrona-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehncrona 1981</LINK>). Enhanced acidosis may exaggerate ischaemic neuronal injury by facilitating free radical formation, activating pH-dependent endonucleases, or altering intracellular calcium regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Combs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Regli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehncrona-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehncrona 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siesjo-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siesjo 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siesjo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siesjo 1996</LINK>). Moderately and severely elevated blood glucose levels have been shown to enhance cortical intracellular acidosis and significantly worsen mitochondrial function (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoxworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoxworth 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has also been postulated that intracellular acidosis enhances glutamate release. Glutamate plays a central role in neuronal death because it activates post-synaptic glutamate receptors and leads to an excessive influx of calcium, subsequent mitochondrial injury, and cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nedergaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nedergaard 1996</LINK>). In addition, the pre-synaptic release of glutamate mediates repeated waves of spreading depression (a decrease of activity in the cortex), which is another mechanism believed to propagate the necrosis of penumbral tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Koistinaho-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koistinaho 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous studies in humans showed that people with acute ischaemic stroke and hyperglycaemia had worse outcomes when compared with those with normal glycaemic levels. Multiple observational studies have showed that people with hyperglycaemia exhibited greater stroke severity and greater functional impairment than those with normoglycaemia; people with hyperglycaemia were 2.3 times more likely to be dead at 90 days compared with those with normal glucose levels in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2009</LINK>). To date, most of the work done in humans in the field of hyperglycaemia and stroke has been limited to correlating the presence of hyperglycaemia to ischaemic stroke outcome. The next logical step in this debate is to ascertain whether treating hyperglycaemia following stroke does, in fact, reduce mortality and improve functional outcome.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:22:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Insulin has a number of effects on glucose metabolism including inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, increased glucose transport into fat and muscle, increased glycolysis, and stimulation of glycogen synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Ramnanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramnanan 2010</LINK>). All these mechanisms decrease the levels of circulating glucose. Insulin serves to co-ordinate the use of alternative fuels (glucose and free fatty acids) to meet the energy demands of the organism during fasting, exercise, and stress (<LINK REF="REF-Farese-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farese 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fielding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fielding 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:22:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In acute stroke the initial ischaemia is rarely complete due to collateral blood supply. The ischaemic penumbra is the area of hypoperfused, but still viable, tissue that surrounds a densely ischaemic, hypoxic core. This is the area that is vulnerable to the metabolic imbalances mentioned above. With hyperglycaemia, there is a reduction in penumbral salvage and an increase in brain lactate levels (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is believed that if the detrimental effects associated with hyperglycaemia are mediated primarily through metabolic mechanisms, tight glycaemic control during acute stroke may reduce the extent of ultimate brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Bruno-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruno 2004</LINK>). Acute hyperglycaemia is associated by neuroimaging with reduced salvage of penumbral tissue and greater final infarct size (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2002</LINK>), and hyperglycaemia is associated with reduced benefit from recanalization with thrombolytic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bruno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruno 2002</LINK>). Also, experimental studies have showed that administration of insulin during focal and global ischaemia may reduce subsequent brain damage (<LINK REF="REF-Auer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voll-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voll 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voll-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voll 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wass-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wass 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1994</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:23:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Using a standardised data extraction form and working in duplicate, two review authors (MFB and RMG) abstracted the following descriptive data from every study: description of randomisation, concealment of participants, blinding, intention to treat and lost to follow-up as part of the quality assessment. The same two review authors also collected information on: definitive or presumed acute ischaemic stroke (based on the use of CT or MRI before or after randomisation), number of participants, gender, age, proportion of people with diabetes, setting (stroke unit, critical care unit, or non-critical care unit), characteristics of treatment and control interventions (insulin dose, frequency, route, and duration), co-interventions, and frequency of the glucose level checks.</P>
<P>We abstracted the specific stroke outcomes from every study. We collected end-of-study deaths, Barthel score, Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), European Stroke Scale (ESS), and the number of hypoglycaemic events (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Outcomes were collected at the end of follow-up. Follow-up was defined for each study as &#8804; 30 or &#8804; 90 days. We contacted all the authors of the included studies, if data were missing or unclear, to obtain full details.</P>
<P>The same two review authors resolved any discrepancies between the two sets of data through discussion. One author (MFB) entered the data into the Review Manager software, RevMan 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>) and performed the analyses.</P>

<P>We used RevMan 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>) for all the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>We analysed the primary outcome of death or dependency at the end of the scheduled follow-up as a binary outcome.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of neurological deficit after intervention, the NIHSS and the ESS are ordinal scales with a minimum increment of one point and we used these as continuous variables for the purposes of the analyses. The NIHSS ranges from 0 to 42 points, with 0 points being no measurable neurological deficit. The ESS ranges from 0 to 100 points, with 0 points being bedridden. We analysed hypoglycaemia as a binary outcome with a cut-off value of less than 3 mmol/L and defined symptomatic hypoglycaemia as confusion, visual disturbances, seizures, sweating, or hunger in a person with a glucose level lower than 3 mmol/L.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we determined the pooled mean difference (MD) between the treatment and control interventions and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes using different scales (for example for assessment of the final deficit with the NIHSS and ESS) we determined the pooled SMD between the treatment and control interventions and the associated 95% CI using a fixed-effect model. For binary outcomes we determined the odds ratio (OR) between the treatment and control interventions and the associated 95% CI using a fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>Enrolled participants were typically older people (mean age 74 years) with equal gender distribution. Baseline characteristics were similar in the intervention and control groups, with higher baseline glycaemic levels measured at admission in the cohorts with a higher proportion of people with diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-GIST_x002d_UK-2007" TYPE="STUDY">GIST-UK 2007</LINK>,16% of the cohort had a disease different from ischaemic stroke but with a measurable neurological impairment (for example intracranial haemorrhage).</P>
<P>In nine studies participants had a definitive diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke prior to randomisation. All 11 studies reported intervention with an intravenous insulin infusion. <LINK REF="STD-Vinychuk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vinychuk 2005</LINK> reported the results separately for participants with and without diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>For the functional outcome, four studies used the Barthel score and six studies used the modified Rankin Scale. <LINK REF="STD-Walters-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Walters 2006</LINK> did not report functional outcome scales.</P>
<P>One study in the previous version of this review (Staszewski 2007) is now included as a published study (<LINK REF="STD-Staszewski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Staszewski 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the neurological deficit assessment, six studies reported the NIHSS and one reported the ESS at the end of the follow-up. The NIHSS is a 42-point score; a higher score indicates a worse functional outcome and higher level of disability. The ESS score ranges from 0 to 100 points, 0 being bedridden and a higher score showing a better functional outcome.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-06 15:08:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our updated systematic review and meta-analyses found similar results to those published two years ago and suggest that the administration of intravenous insulin in an attempt to maintain serum glucose within a specific normal range in the first hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide benefit in terms of functional outcome or deaths at 30 days or 90 days, or improvement in final neurological deficit.</P>
<P>While there was no difference in net benefit noted between the treatment and control groups, there was a significant difference between the groups with regard to the adverse event of hypoglycaemia. Specifically, those participants who were maintained within a more tight range of glycaemia with intravenous insulin experienced a greater risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia than those in the control group.</P>
<P>When examining the endpoint of dependency or death, subgroup analyses showed that there was no difference between participants with DM and those without, and there was no difference when looking at the outcome at 30 days or 90 days.</P>
<P>For the endpoint of final neurological deficit, we found no difference in the mean NIHSS or ESS scores between the intervention and control groups. In the subgroup analyses there was no statistically significant difference between the DM and non-DM cohorts. This means that the treatment did not appear to be more effective in one or the other group of participants.</P>
<P>For the subgroup analyses of neurological deficit at 30 days versus 90 days, the effect of the intervention was favourable in those studies that reported the outcome at 30 days but not at 90 days; this result is difficult to interpret because the natural history of ischaemic stroke is that the outcomes improve and stabilize by three months, which is likely to be why this time point is more common and reliable in studies of ischaemic stroke. Another possible explanation for this result is better quality of the studies that reported the outcomes at 90 days; as these studies were bigger and accounted for 81% of the total number of participants included in the review; two of the three studies were blinded to the allocation group when evaluating the neurological and functional outcomes. In comparison, for the 30-day outcome only one of the five studies was blinded for the neurological and functional outcome assessments.</P>
<P>When plotting the results in a two by two table we found that the number needed to treat (NNT) or to harm (NNH) for the outcome of death was 91, meaning that one in every 91 patients could be harmed by the treatment, with an absolute risk increase of 1.10% in the treatment group (95% CI -3.3 to 5.5%). Because the confidence interval includes positive and negative numbers, the NNT or NNH was not significant between the treatment and control groups for this outcome.</P>
<P>The NNT for the outcome of dependency or death was 419, meaning that one in every 419 patients could benefit from the treatment, with an absolute risk reduction of 0.24% % in the treatment group (95% CI -4.5% to 5.0%). Because the confidence interval includes positive and negative numbers, the NNT was not significant between the treatment and control groups for this outcome.</P>
<P>The NNH for the outcome of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was nine, meaning that one in every nine patients will have a symptomatic hypoglycaemic event with an absolute risk increase of 11.5%% in the treatment group (95% CI 9.1 to 13.9%). This is statistically significant. The 95% CI for the NNT ranges from 7.2 to 11.0.</P>
<P>Remaining questions include how tight the control must be to obtain the most benefit without increasing the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, and whether an acuity level exists in which this benefit is not clearly visualized (<LINK REF="REF-Bochicchio-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bochicchio 2008</LINK>). The extent to which intensive insulin therapy and tight control of blood glucose improve the outcome after ischaemic neurological insults remains unclear. The benefit of such treatment regimes may be negated by the hypoglycaemic episodes, which may aggravate neurological injury (<LINK REF="REF-Prakash-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prakash 2008</LINK>). Although it seems sensible to control hyperglycaemia in people with neurological injury the treatment must account for potential hypoglycaemic episodes, which can be detrimental. Therefore, it seems prudent that we accept slightly less tight blood glucose control than in critically ill people without neurological injury.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:01:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our review suggests that the administration of intravenous insulin in an attempt to maintain serum glucose within a specific normal range in the first hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide benefit in terms of functional outcome, disability, improvement in final neurological deficit, or death at 30 or 90 days, and confers a greater risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:26:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The studies identified in this review are sufficient to address the objectivesof the review, and the population that is included allows for good generalization of the results and external validity. The studies include more than 1000 participants from different countries overall. These results discourage the maintenance of a tight glycaemic control.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:02:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 11 trials involving 1583 participants (791 intervention and 792 controls). There was an intermediate risk of bias overall. The allocation concealment was adequate in most of the studies, but most of the studies were not blinded. The heterogeneity across the studies was adequate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:27:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, only 11 studies were available for inclusion in the analyses. Second, the studies were performed in a stroke unit and not in the general ward. Specialised units for the management of people with stroke have been shown to improve the outcomes of those people presenting with haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes, and should be the preferred setting (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the meta-analyses we decided to use the fixed-effect method instead of the random-effects method because of a suspected acceptable level of heterogeneity across the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). The random-effects method assumes that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). The random and inverse variance methods will give similar results when there is no heterogeneity among the studies. Where there is heterogeneity, confidence intervals for the average treatment effect will be wider if the random-effects model rather than a fixed-effect model is used, and corresponding claims of statistical significance of the treatment effect will be more conservative. It is also possible that the central estimate will change if there are relationships between the observed treatment effects and sample sizes. The fixed-effect model is based on the mathematical assumption that a single common effect underlies every study in the meta-analysis; this assumes that there is low heterogeneity among the studies.</P>
<P>When evaluating heterogeneity the readers must be cautious in interpreting the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic because of the moderate number of studies included and the small number of participants in each study. Therefore, tests that do not reject the null hypothesis do not necessarily indicate absence of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2003</LINK>). However, we decided that it was sensible to pool the results. Heterogeneity comes from clinical differences. For instance, the biggest study (<LINK REF="STD-GIST_x002d_UK-2007" TYPE="STUDY">GIST-UK 2007</LINK>) included 16% of participants without an ischaemic stroke, contributing to some degree to heterogeneity. Another source of heterogeneity is differences in the treatment effects secondary to a different methodological approach (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2003</LINK>); for instance, few studies were blinded to the allocation group when assessing the outcome. To explore heterogeneity we performed subgroup analyses. One particular problem with the <LINK REF="STD-GIST_x002d_UK-2007" TYPE="STUDY">GIST-UK 2007</LINK>, the biggest included study, is that there might be confounding that is secondary to lower blood pressure levels in the intervention group. This study found that the overall mean plasma glucose level and mean systolic blood pressure were significantly lower in the glucose-insulin-potassium group (MD in glucose 0.57 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.001; MD in blood pressure 9.0 mm Hg, P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of final neurological deficit, we used ordinal scales (NIHSS and ESS) as continuous outcomes, and we made the assumption that they followed a normal distribution for the purposes of the meta-analyses, but we acknowledge that in clinical practice most of the functional scales have a skewed distribution in favour of better scores. We are aware that the methods for meta-analysis of continuous data assume that the outcomes have a normal distribution in each treatment arm in each study. This assumption may not always be met, although this is less important in large studies.</P>
<P>For the final neurological deficit, we used the SMD approach instead of the MD because the scales were different (NIHSS and ESS). In this case, the standard deviation was used to standardise the MDs to a single scale as well as in the computation of study weights. It is assumed that a variation between standard deviations reflects only differences in measurement scales and not differences in the reliability of the outcome measures or variability among trial populations. These limitations of the methods should be borne in mind where an unexpected variation of standard deviations across studies is observed.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses test the robustness of the results relative to features of the primary studies and to key assumptions and decisions (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>), and they test for bias due to the retrospective nature of systematic reviews. Sensitivity analyses in meta-analysis allow more appropriate and reliable conclusions when problems such as unavailable estimates are present (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2004</LINK>). We were able to perform only a minor percentage of the previously proposed sensitivity analyses due to the fact that, for the primary outcome, some studies did not report enough data.</P>
<P>Reviewing research for systematic reviews implies a retrospective nature and therefore is subject to random and systematic error (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2003</LINK>). In order to decrease this error, we wrote a protocol before the search was made and two review authors worked independently in the extraction of the information, with substantial agreement in the decisions on which studies should be included.</P>
<P>Publication bias could affect our review despite our extensive search procedure. More than 10 studies (ideally more than 30 studies) should be included in order to provide a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2006</LINK>). We did not contact pharmaceutical companies manufacturing insulin. Our meta-analysis included only RCTs and we found only one unpublished study in the previous version of the review that was subsequently published in 2011.We contacted the authors for clarification in regards to study information when appropriate.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:27:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Clinical trials that investigated the role of intensive glycaemic control on critically ill people have produced controversial results. Studies in favour of tight glucose control include <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2001</LINK>, which showed that insulin therapy decreases mortality in people with DM and those undergoing surgery. Another study reported beneficial outcomes with strict blood glucose control after cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ingels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingels 2006</LINK>). A study by Lazar et al found that tight glycaemic control in people with DM undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) improved perioperative outcomes, enhanced survival, and decreased the incidence of ischaemic events and wound complications (<LINK REF="REF-Lazar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazar 2004</LINK>). A study by Vriesendorp et al, on people undergoing surgery for oesophageal cancer, reported an association between postoperative glucose levels and an increased length of hospital stay, but not an increase in infectious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Vriesendorp-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vriesendorp 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our results are in keeping with other more recent trials of tight glycaemic control. In a study of 400 people after cardiac surgery, there was an increased incidence of death and stroke in the intensive insulin treatment group (<LINK REF="REF-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandhi 2007</LINK>). In a later study, Van den Berghe et al studied 1200 people and showed that there was no change in mortality among people in medical intensive care units (ICU) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2006</LINK>). Brunkhorst et al studied 537 people with sepsis and found no significant difference between the intensive and conventional therapy groups in the rate of death or mean score for organ failure (<LINK REF="REF-Brunkhorst-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunkhorst 2008</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-CREATE_x002d_ECLA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CREATE-ECLA 2005</LINK> study compared glucose-insulin-potassium infusion with usual care in 20,000 people presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and found a lack of benefit on mortality, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock. The multicentre Normoglycaemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (<LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002d_SUGAR" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE-SUGAR</LINK>) study had a mixed ICU population with 6104 people. This study provided evidence that intensive insulin treatment was associated with increased mortality and increased hypoglycaemia without significant differences in critical care unit or hospital length of stay, number of days of mechanical ventilation, or need for renal replacement therapy. In a meta-analysis of 29 RCTs involving 8432 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Wiener-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiener 2008</LINK>) there was no difference in hospital mortality between tight and usual glucose control (21.6% versus 23.3%).</P>

<P>Evidence from this systematic review indicates that, compared with control intervention, the administration of insulin with the aim of maintaining glucose within a specific range immediately after acute ischaemic stroke does not reduce dependency, neurological deficit, or mortality at 30 days or 90 days. These findings did not change in the subgroup analysis of those with diabetes mellitus compared with those without diabetes mellitus. There was, however, a significant increase in episodes of hypoglycaemia in the treatment group. This review provides no evidence to support the use of intensive insulin therapy for tight glucose control after acute stroke. The number needed to treat is not significant for the outcome of death or the composite outcome of dependency and death, and the number needed to harm is nine for symptomatic hypoglycaemia.<BR/>

<P>In animal studies and human studies of acute stroke, hyperglycaemia has been shown to have a deleterious effect on the critical area of ischaemic penumbra. This review and other similar studies of glucose control have been unable to provide reliable evidence that tight glycaemic control improves functional outcome or reduces mortality in people with acute ischaemic stroke. At this time, the benefits of maintaining tight glucose control do not outweigh the potential risks of hypoglycaemia to the already vulnerable ischaemic penumbra in ischaemic stroke patients.<BR/>
