These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side-effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high dose of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. It has been proposed that tardive dyskinesia could be due to cholinergic deficiency. Older cholinergic drugs, such as deanol, lecithin and meclofenoxate, have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia. New cholinergic drugs, such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and may also be promising in the treatment for tardive dyskinesia.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B>.</P><P>We searched for trials in July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo. All studies randomised small numbers of participants (five to 60 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.</P><P><B>Key results</B>.</P><P>We found the effects of both older and newer cholinergic drugs to be unclear as too few and too small studies are available and do not yield great evidence and leave many questions unanswered.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B>.</P><P>The available evidence is weak, limited, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia based on our findings. To fully investigate whether the use of cholinergic drugs have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be well-designed, larger, longer-term studies, particularly on new cholinergic drugs currently being used for treating Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</P><P>Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.</P><P><A HREF="http://mcpin.org/">http://mcpin.org/</A></P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-31 06:47:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains a troublesome adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication.

This register is assembled by extensive searches for randomised controlled trials in many electronic databases, registers of trials, conference proceedings and dissertations. References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included reports identified by the search if they were of controlled trials involving people with antipsychotic-induced TD and chronic mental illness, who had been randomly allocated to either a cholinergic agent or to a placebo or no intervention.

We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis, with the assumption that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo published between 1976 and 2014. All studies involved small numbers of participants (five to 60 people). Three studies that investigated the new cholinergic Alzheimer drugs for the treatment of TD are new to this update. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, we are unsure if data are incomplete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. </P><P>We are uncertain about the effect of new or old cholinergic drugs on no clinically important improvement in TD symptoms when compared with placebo; the quality of evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.23; 27 people, 4 RCTs). Eight trials found that cholinergic drugs may make little or no difference to deterioration of TD symptoms (low-quality evidence, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.24; 147 people). Again, due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects on mental state (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.61; 77 people, 5 RCTs), adverse events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.14; 106 people, 4 RCTs), and leaving the study early (RR 1.09,95% CI 0.56 to 2.10; 288 people 12 RCTs). No study reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-16 11:26:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>TD remains a major public health problem. The clinical effects of both older cholinergic drugs and new cholinergic agents, now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, are unclear, as too few, too small studies leave many questions unanswered. Cholinergic drugs should remain of interest to researchers and currently have little place in routine clinical work. However, with the advent of new cholinergic agents now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, scope exists for more informative trials. If these new cholinergic agents are to be investigated for treating people with TD, their effects should be demonstrated in large well-designed, conducted and reported randomised trials.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-16 12:39:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Since the 1950s antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication has been used extensively to treat people with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. These drugs can effectively control symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). In addition, maintenance therapy with antipsychotics is associated with a reduced risk of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>). However, antipsychotic medication has also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders. The appearance of these disorders can be extremely disfiguring, compounds stigma, and is associated with poor compliance to antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>).</P><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is one such movement disorder and is characterised by abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements. The clinical features include: tongue protrusion, side-to-side or rotatory movement of the jaw, lip smacking, puckering and pursing, and rapid eye blinking (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1999</LINK>). In some people rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. TD is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which fluctuates spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission (<LINK REF="REF-Cavallaro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavallaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>). Studies on the natural history of TD have reported widely variable remission rates (1% to 62%) depending on the patient's age, psychiatric diagnosis, course of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P><P>The exact mechanisms of the pathophysiology of TD are unknown. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain - one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1995</LINK>). One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that long-term blockade of the dopamine receptors may lead to an imbalance between the activity of dopamine cells and others that employ choline (<LINK REF="REF-Alphs-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alphs 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1995</LINK>). This theory implies that there is an over activity of dopaminergic transmission in relation to cholinergic transmission in the striatum. Another hypothesis suggests that the chronic use of antipsychotics may also cause an abnormal production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in turn, could contribute to the pathophysiology of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Andreassen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreassen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andreassen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreassen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cadet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadet 1989</LINK>). The latter theory is supported by the persistent nature of the syndrome, once established.</P><P>TD occurs in more than 20% of people that use first-generation antipsychotic drugs continually for longer than three months (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>). Every year 4% to 5% of adults and 25% to 30% of elderly persons who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2004</LINK>). Advancing age is a risk factor for both TD's prevalence and severity, with those who are &lt; 60 years of age being three times more likely to spontaneously remit (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>).</P><P>When the second-generation antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1990&#8217;s many hoped that they would not cause TD (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenheck-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenheck 2007</LINK>). Although the risk of developing TD with second-generation antipsychotic drugs does seem to be reduced, TD risks have not been eliminated (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>). There is even some evidence to indicate that rates of TD do not differ at all between first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenheck-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenheck 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2010</LINK>). The large, definitive, US randomised trial of antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia (CATIE), with a four-year period of follow-up, obtained an incidence rate of TD of around 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2008</LINK>). Due to widespread use of second-generation antipsychotic drugs, increased off-label use, and an ageing population, the frequency of TD is likely to be higher than thought (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2012</LINK>), and increasing. The problem will be considerably greater for people in countries where use of newer drugs is less prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Ballesteros-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballesteros 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-31 06:52:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Medications affecting the cholinergic pathway have been tested for the treatment of TD due to the hypothesis that TD is correlated with damage in cholinergic cells in striatal subregions. This damage might be caused by changes in dopaminergic transmission, as a result of prolonged antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Grimm-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimm 2001</LINK>). A variety of cholinergic medications have been used in TD, starting from the 1970's. The cholinergic compounds included in this review have various functions in relation to acetylcholine, the main neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the cholinergic pathway. </P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review looked at compounds such as physostigmine, choline, and lecithin (containing phosphatidyl choline), which were some of the early cholinergic medications used for TD, as they were thought to be of potential help in treating TD by enhancing acetylcholine synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Wurtman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurtman 1978</LINK>). It was thought that high levels of choline in the blood (which, for instance, phosphatidyl choline converts into after digestion) would enhance acetylcholine synthesis in neurons by making the precursor more available. Other treatments included, such as deanol and meclofenoxate, have been tested due to their cholinomimetic actions (<LINK REF="STD-Casey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1986</LINK>). Deanol, a synthetic substance, is also thought to be a precursor of acetylcholine, but this is unproven, and deanol might be an acetylcholine agonist or even a suppressor of acetylcholine synthesis. During the last 20 years many new central nervous system (CNS)-active cholinergic compounds, predominantly acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors such as galantamine (<LINK REF="REF-Loy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loy 2006</LINK>), rivastigmine (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2015</LINK>) and donepezil (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006b</LINK>), have emerged for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. These compounds were also included in this review, due to their potential for treating TD symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Caroff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Caroff 2001</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several atypical antipsychotic drugs have been produced in the last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does point to the fact that thoughtful use of older generation drugs is not associated with any more problems of TD than with newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs - such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol - will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with the emergence of TD and, therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>TD can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>) and symptoms are often irreversible (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerlach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>). Additionally, TD is frequently associated with lower quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ascher_x002d_Svanum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher-Svanum 2008</LINK>) and a greater mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2009</LINK>). Given the high incidence and prevalence of TD among people taking antipsychotic medication, the need for prevention or treatment is clear. Unfortunately, there has been sparse evidence to guide clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2009</LINK>). Although many treatments have been tested, no one intervention has been shown clearly to be effective. Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication would be the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many individuals such a reduction would lead to relapse. This review focuses on whether the addition of different types of cholinergic medications to those already receiving antipsychotic medication is likely to help TD. </P><P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) evaluating treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD, and is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 1997</LINK>), and previously updated in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Tammenmaa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tammenmaa 2002</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary objective of this review is to determine the effects of cholinergic drugs (arecoline, choline, deanol, lecithin, meclofenoxate, physostigmine, RS 86, tacrine, metoxytacrine, galantamine, ipidacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, xanomeline, cevimeline) for treating antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness.<BR/></P><P>The secondary objectives are:<BR/>1. to examine whether duration of treatment has an effect on treatment response;<BR/>2. to examine whether there is difference in treatment effect for the various cholinergic compounds;<BR/>3. to examine whether treatment response differs in people with schizophrenia who are older (above 65 years) and for whom the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesias is estimated to be higher.

We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we noted in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> if this was the case or not.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING><P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/></P><P>We entered data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies &lt; 200 participants:</P><P>(a) when a scale started from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING><P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for cholinergic medication. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not un-improved'), we presented data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome and noted this in the relevant graphs.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></DATA_EXTRACTION><QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Review authors RA and HB independently assessed risk of bias within the included studies by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P><P>If the raters disagreed, we made the final rating by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group.

Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.

If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table by down-rating quality.

If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either 'P' value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches. (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.

Completeness</HEADING><P>The most important finding of this review is that a systematic search of the literature still results in a review that is considerably underpowered to really investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of cholinergic agents in TD. All data are inconclusive. We were unable to detect any effect, good or bad of these drugs for TD. With the advent of new CNS-active cholinergic agents for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia (e.g., <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maidment-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maidment 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolinski-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolinski 2012</LINK>), the theoretical base for this review is strengthened. However, the actual central cholinergic transmission -enhancing effect of old cholinergic drugs, such as lecithin and especially deanol, remains unclear. Even if any of these old compounds had an effect on cholinergic transmission, the impact would probably be limited. Modern cholinergic drugs use a different mode of action and are worthy of investigation, although they are associated with gastrointestinal adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maidment-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maidment 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolinski-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolinski 2012</LINK>). However, to date, these newer drugs have not been fully investigated in RCTs in the treatment of TD.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING><P>All but two trials were hospital-based but were nevertheless on people who would be recognisable in everyday care. Trials were set in high-income countries in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. Cholinergic drugs are readily accessible and most outcomes understandable in terms of clinical practice. Should cholinergic drugs have had important effects the findings may well have been applicable.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, the certainty of the evidence in this review is low to very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from the estimates of the effect.

We believe that 'Summary of findings' tables are a valuable innovation &#8211; but problematic to those not &#8216;blind&#8217; to the outcome data. It is possible to &#8216;cherry pick&#8217; significant findings for presentation in this table. We have tried to decrease the chance of doing this by asking a new review author (HB) to select outcomes relevant for this table before becoming familiar with the data.</P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The only other relevant quantitative reviews we know of is the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Tammenmaa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tammenmaa 2002</LINK>) and another systematic review that included the same RCTs as the Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Tammenmaa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tammenmaa 2004</LINK>). These reviews found no evidence to support administration of the old cholinergic agents lecithin, deanol, and meclofenoxate to patients with TD, and concluded that further investigation of the clinical effects of novel cholinergic agents in TD is warranted. This update identified three new studies to include (as discussed in <LINK TAG="SEARCH_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results of the search</LINK>), but does not substantially change these findings or conclusions.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For the person with tardive dyskinesia (TD)</HEADING><P>Given the absence of evidence for efficacy, and given that cholinergic medication is associated with adverse effects, it would be understandable if a person with TD would rather avoid these additional treatments. Should the TD be serious and warrant intervention, the person with the movement disorder or their family may wish to ask for use of one of the more modern cholinergics within a well-designed, conducted and reported randomised trial.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>The available data on the efficacy of cholinergic medications for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced TD are insufficient to recommend their use. Adverse effects associated with some of these compounds are burdensome. Nevertheless, there is a real place for clinician-driven research, with prescription within the context of a randomised trial and routine data collection on outcomes of relevance to people with TD and their clinicians.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policy makers and funders of studies</HEADING><P>This is one of the reviews in the series of Cochrane reviews on treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). No evidence is convincing that addition or withdrawal of another drug helps with the symptoms of TD. There are, however, many unanswered questions in this area. This unattractive adverse effect is caused, to a greater or lesser extent, by antipsychotic drugs. Clinicians and researchers should feel responsible enough to continue to try to help it. Those compiling guidance could encourage supportive activity and more research into this neglected area.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING><P>If cholinergic agents are to be investigated, their effects should be demonstrated in well-designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2.

It is possible that cholinergic agents have a small-to-moderate effect (positive or negative) that has not, as yet, been detected. The results of this review do not support further investigation of the effects of lecithin and deanol. However, there is a need for well-designed, conducted and reported randomised trials to evaluate the effects of modern cholinergic agents for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced TD. Such studies are of importance to people with the problem (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and have long been ignored.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2.1 Trial design</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">a. Use of cross-over design</HEADING><P>Trialists find it difficult to identify people with both TD and schizophrenia to participate in trials. Randomised cross-over design is used in the hope of improving the power of the study to find outcomes of interest. This design initially asks participants to be randomised to one of the experimental interventions, and then, at a pre-specified time, to be crossed over to the treatment that they did not at first receive. Conditions with a more stable time course than TD are better suited for cross-over studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>). Further difficulties are the carry-over effect. Unless cross-over studies include a mid-study washout period (where the person is free of treatment before starting the next arm of the study), any effect of cholinergic drugs may continue into the second half placebo arm of the trial &#8211; the 'carry-over effect'. Also, carry-over may involve the re-growth or retreat of neuroreceptors. This slow re-balancing, if started, could continue long after all traces of intervention drugs are gone, so the physiological half life of the experimental treatment may not be the only variable to consider when thinking though the issues of carry-over. TD is also an unstable condition and people with TD may not remain compliant with medication. All these factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology strong, despite the initial attraction (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">b. Sample size calculation</HEADING><P>All studies included in this review had a small sample size (five to 60). However, the results suggest that a larger sample size should be used to provide more precise estimates of effect.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">c. Outcomes</HEADING><P>Many of the outcomes initially desired when this review was started have not been investigated. In addition to efficacy, it is important to assess the influence on mental state and adverse effects. Finally, a service user consultation informed the addition of outcomes of special importance to patients. We have reconsidered all these outcomes in case they were too ambitious and tried to tailor them to a real-world pragmatic trial design (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-10-31 16:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The review authors wish to thank Prof Kristian Wahlbeck, who acted as an advisor throughout the first version of the review process, for his constant help.

Selection of trials<BR/>The title or abstract of each reference identified by the search was inspected independently by two reviewers (IT and ES) to assess relevance. For articles that could possibly have been RCTs, or in cases of disagreement, the full article was obtained. In turn these articles were independently inspected. There was no disagreement between the two reviewers regarding which trials were relevant.</P><P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>The methodological quality of each included trial was assessed independently by two reviewers (IT and ES). Quality was evaluated using criteria described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment (blinding of random assignment of participants to intervention groups) and the potential for bias in the results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), i.e. lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with selection bias (systematic differences in comparison groups). Thus trials can, to a certain extent, be evaluated by their method of allocation concealment. The method for assigning participants to interventions undergoing comparison should be robust against selection bias (i.e. the trialist should not be able to influence which intervention the participant will receive nor should any foreknowledge of treatment assignment influence recruitment) and its description should be clear (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>). The risk for bias in the results of a study is defined as below (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>):</P><P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment)</P><P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop-outs?<BR/>Each item receives 1 point if the answer is positive. In addition: 1 additional point each is given, if randomisation and/or blinding procedures are described and adequate. 1 point each can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described were inadequate. Thus the maximum score is 5 points. (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P><P>Only trials described as randomised (category A or B) were included in the statistical analysis. The Jadad scale was used as an extra assessment of quality, however Jadad points were not used to exclude trials. If there was not enough information in the publication to assess adequate randomisation and methodological quality, or there was disagreement between the two reviewers, the article was added to those awaiting assessment and authors of the study were contacted for clarification. Justification for excluding trials from the analysis was documented.</P><P>3. Data extraction<BR/>Data from the included trials were extracted by two researchers. Two kinds of measures were extracted: dichotomous (binary, yes/no) data and continuous (scale) data.</P><P>Trials in which a crossover design was used included the risk of carry over effects of a medication in the second or more stages of the trial (after crossover). To exclude potential carry over effects, only data from the first stage of the trial (before crossover) were used in the analysis.<BR/>In the case of incomplete data, the article was added to those awaiting assessment and authors were contacted for clarification. If a trial met the criteria for methodological quality, but it was impossible to extract any data or collect unpublished data from the authors, the study had to be excluded from statistical analysis.</P><P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>Where possible, all data were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle (once randomised, always analyse). Data were excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. (This did not include the outcome of 'drop-outs'.) In studies with less than a 50% drop-out rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. When possible and appropriate, the 'Last Observation Carried Forward' technique was used in analysis of continuous outcomes.</P><P>4.2 Dichotomous data<BR/>For dichotomous outcomes a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. If overall results were significant, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated from the absolute risk difference between treatment and control groups. If heterogeneity was found it was investigated and a random effects model used.</P><P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Normally distributed versus skewed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. A reliable statistical analysis of groups undergoing comparison requires that samples tested attain a normal distribution. To avoid including non-normally distributed samples in the statistical analysis, the following standards were applied to all continuous data before inclusion:<BR/>1) Standard deviations and means were reported or derivable from data in the publication, or were obtainable from authors.<BR/>2) When a scale started from a finite number (such as zero), the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>).<BR/>3) If a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score of the scale. Endpoint scores on scales used in clinical practice often have a definite minimum and maximum on the scale, and so these rules can be applied to them.</P><P>4.3.2 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes a pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was calculated. If heterogeneity was found it was investigated and a random effects model used.</P><P>4.3.3 Valid scales<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid. Unpublished instruments are more likely to report statistically significant findings than those that have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). The following minimum standards were set for valid scales: 1. The instrument had to have been described in a peer reviewed journal. 2. The instrument had to be either a self report scale or completed by an independent rater.</P><P>4.3.4 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes the possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is impossible to tell whether data is non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use end point data of a scale (participants' total scores at the end of study - not change in score from baseline), which typically cannot have negative values. Where possible endpoint data were presented, and if both endpoint and change (from baseline) data were available for the same outcome, then only the former were used.</P><P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>It is important not to pool heterogeneous studies together, as heterogeneity might reflect differences in study design or sample population, rather than true variation in results of the outcome measured. To investigate the possibility of heterogeneity of trial results, a Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test was used, as well as visual inspection of graphs. A significance level less than 0.10 was pre-defined as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found, the reasons for it were explored. If no study-related explaining factor was found, data were tested pooled using the random effects model which takes into account the variation between studies. (The random effects model is more conservative in estimating treatment effect, and takes into account that some trials will produce odd results by chance.) If using the random effects model did not change the statistical significance level of the results, the results remained pooled. If the random effects model did change the statistical significance of the result, studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P><P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P><P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>Four sensitivity analyses were prespecified: 1.Treatment effect differs according to difference in the quality of trials, 2. Treatment effect differs according to different lengths of treatment, 3. Treatment effect differs for the various drugs and 4. Treatment effect differs according to the age of the participants (this sensitivity analysis was added in the first substantial up-date of the review). These analyses were evaluated by looking at separate subgroups of trials.</P><P>8. General<BR/>Data were entered into Revman in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect in the graph indicated a favourable outcome for cholinergic agents.</P></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_2" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="2"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;14 studies (19 references) included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;14 studies (19 references) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;72 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;742 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;742 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;704 records identified through database searching&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;30 additional records identified from reference lists of Cochrane reviews on antipsychotic-induced TD&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 records found from searching in 2017&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;670 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;53 full-text articles (49 studies) excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
