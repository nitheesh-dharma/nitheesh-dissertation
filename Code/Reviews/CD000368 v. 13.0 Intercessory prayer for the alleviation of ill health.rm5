<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-08 12:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intercessory prayer is one of the oldest and most common interventions used with the intention of alleviating illness and promoting good health. It is practised by many faiths and involves a person or group setting time aside to petition God (or a god) on behalf of another who is in some kind of need. This review examines whether there is a difference in outcome for people who are prayed for by name whilst ill, or recovering from an illness or operation, and those who are not. Both groups of people still received their usual treatment for their illness. Ten trials were found which randomised a total of 7646 people. The majority of these compared prayer (for someone to become well) plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual without prayer. One trial had two prayer groups, comparing participants who knew they were being prayed for with those who did not.  Another trial prayed retroactively, randomising people a month to 6 years after they were admitted to hospital. Each trial had people with different illnesses. These included leukaemia, heart problems, blood infection, alcohol abuse and psychological or rheumatic disease. In one trial people were judged to be at high or low risk of death and placed in relevant groups.</P>
<P>Overall, there was no significant difference in recovery from illness or death between those prayed for and those not prayed for. In the trials that measured post-operative or other complications, indeterminate and bad outcomes, or readmission to hospital, no significant differences between groups were also found. Specific complications (cardiac arrest, major surgery before discharge, need for a monitoring catheter in the heart) were significantly more likely to occur among those in the group not receiving prayer. Finally, when comparing those who knew about being prayed for with those who did not, there were fewer post-operative complications in those who had no knowledge of being prayed for.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that due to various limitations in the trials included in this review (such as unclear randomising procedures and the reporting of many different outcomes and illnesses) it is only possible to state that intercessory prayer is neither significantly beneficial nor harmful for those who are sick. Further studies which are better designed and reported would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-06 14:17:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prayer is amongst the oldest and most widespread interventions used with the intention of alleviating illness and promoting good health. Given the significance of this response to illness for a large proportion of the world's population, there has been considerable interest in recent years in measuring the efficacy of intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health in a scientifically rigorous fashion. The question of whether this may contribute towards proving or disproving the existence of God is a philosophical question lying outside the scope of this review of the effects of prayer. This revised version of the review has been prepared in response to feedback and to reflect new methods in the conduct and presentation of Cochrane reviews.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-08 11:58:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten studies are included in this review (7646 patients). For the comparison of intercessory prayer plus standard care versus standard care alone, overall there was no clear effect of intercessory prayer on death (5 RCTs, n=3389, random-effects RR 1.00 CI 0.74 to1.36). For general clinical state there was also no significant difference between groups (5 RCTs, n=2705, RR intermediate or bad outcome 0.98 CI 0.86 to 1.11). Four studies found no effect for re-admission to Coronary Care Unit (4 RCTs, n=2644, RR 1.00 CI 0.77 to 1.30).Two other trials found intercessory prayer had no effect on re-hospitalisation (2 RCTs, n=1155, RR 0.93 CI 0.71 to 1.22).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-01 09:35:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These findings are equivocal and, although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not and the evidence does not support a recommendation either in favour or against the use of intercessory prayer. We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-09 16:37:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prayer is amongst the oldest and most widespread interventions used with the intention of alleviating illness and promoting good health (<LINK REF="REF-McCaffrey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCaffrey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2004</LINK>). Recent years have seen considerable interest in the beneficial effects of religious belief and communal religious involvement on health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2000</LINK>). Research has been done to investigate the effect for the patient of the complex matter of belonging to a religious tradition and undertaking its distinctive practices. One aspect of this is offering and receiving intercessory prayers for the sick. In this study we consider effect for the patient of intercessory prayer being offered on their behalf, separated from the question of his or her religious affiliation.</P>
<P>Prayer, defined as the "solemn request or thanksgiving to God or object of worship" (<LINK REF="REF-OED-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">OED 1989</LINK>), is an ancient and widely used intervention. There are many different forms of intercessory prayer; it is found in highly developed belief systems and is also practised sporadically by individuals in times of need, relatively free from formal involvement in organised religion. Indeed, one plausible derivation of the word &#8216;God&#8217; and its Indo-European cognates is from a root meaning "the one who is called upon" (<LINK REF="REF-OED-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">OED 1989</LINK>). Prayer has relation to other spiritual disciplines, including meditation and thanksgiving. This review focuses on intercessory prayer which, for the purposes of this study, involves a person or group setting time aside to petition God (or a god) on behalf of another person who is in some kind of need. Intercessory prayer is organised, regular, and committed, and those who practise it will hold some committed belief that they are praying to God (or a god).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-06 14:39:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism(s) by which prayer might work is unknown and hypotheses about this will depend to a large extent on religious beliefs. This review seeks to answer the question of effect not mechanism and it does not seek to answer the question of whether any effects of prayer confirm or refute the existence of God. In determining the direction of any effect, it is important to note that a religious believer may suggest that the nature of divine intervention could be subtle - more subtle, indeed, than is likely to be revealed by the results of a randomised trial. Significance could be attached, for instance, to the question of whether a person has a &#8216;good death&#8217; (approached with courage and having achieved a sense of peace) or a &#8216;bad death&#8217;, even though the &#8216;clinical outcome&#8217; may be measured and recorded as the same. We nonetheless take the stand that claims for intercessory prayer for the sick which go beyond such subtleties can be subject to empirical testing and, potentially, proof and so, whilst not wishing to belittle such distinctions (as, for instance, between a &#8216;good&#8217; and a &#8216;bad&#8217; death), we will test the starker claims that are made for prayer which are of a measurable, directly clinical nature.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-06 14:48:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with all systematic reviews, this review is necessary to bring together the relevant research evidence, to present that evidence and to seek to resolve uncertainties about the effects of intercessory prayer. We note that the results of this review will be of interest to those who are involved with the &#8216;debate about God&#8217; - both religious believers and atheists - but these results cannot directly stand as &#8216;proof&#8217; or &#8216;disproof&#8217; of the existence of God. The extent and manner to which God&#8217;s existence can be determined by reference to events in the world is one of the most significant, and ancient, questions in theology-philosophy, and is contested. (For a recent survey see Denys Turner (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2004</LINK>)). One strand of discussion, for instance, concentrates on the existence of the world rather than any given state of affairs within it. In the words of Ludwig Wittgenstein, &#8216;It is not <I>how </I>things are in the world that is mystical, but <I>that</I> it exists' (<LINK REF="REF-Wittgenstein-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittgenstein 1974</LINK>). We do not, therefore, seek to pose or answer any questions about the existence of God with this reviews. There are several challenges when assessing the results of randomised trials of prayer. There are potential problems with trial methodology. For example, &#8216;contamination&#8217;. The &#8216;control group&#8217; of patients who are not prayed for within the trial may, nonetheless, be the subject of prayers offered by others. For instance, a sizeable number of people - particularly those within religious orders and comparable fraternities - are devoted to the practice of praying for all who are in need. Nonetheless, those who pray for the sick do so out of a conviction that their contribution makes a difference. They do not refrain from praying out of the consideration that someone, somewhere else, may also be praying. This conviction and its consequent practices are sufficiently deeply engrained as to make such studies worthwhile, since this background level of prayer should be evenly distributed to the two intervention groups through the process of random allocation.</P>
<P>A second consideration is the question of whether it makes any sense to speak of a &#8216;blind&#8217; trial if the action (or not) of the intervention is determined by a putative divine agent. Most of the world&#8217;s religious traditions, from within which the prayer under consideration here would be offered, understand God to be omniscient, that is, all-knowing. Therefore there could be no concealment of allocation nor concealment of the group to which a person has been allocated before God, who might choose to influence the patient outcomes because of or instead of the allocation. However, these are theological questions, and this review proceeds on scientific principles in that it is a widely held belief that intercessory prayer is beneficial for those who are unwell because God directs the outcome of those for whom prayers are offered differently from those for whom it is not. As noted above, we are not seeking to assess whether God is or is not the agent of action for prayer but, by using the same study designs used to test other interventions in healthcare we will assess the effects of the intervention. For this reason we also exclude from consideration such theological considerations as the injunction "Do not put the Lord your God to the test" (<LINK REF="REF-Deuteronomy-6_x003a_16" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deuteronomy 6:16</LINK>) or questions as to whether God generally veils his presence from observation: in the words of the philosopher GF Hegel, "God does not offer himself for observation" (<LINK REF="REF-Hegel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegel 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Again working independently, two authors (LR and IA) assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the randomisation sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome measurement, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would have excluded any studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed. If disputes arose as to the correct category for a trial this was resolved through discussion, and guidance from Clive Adams. Where possible, we extracted (and report here) information on the religious beliefs of the authors reporting the included studies because of the possibility that this is related to the risk of bias.</P>

<P>We adopted p=0.05 as the conventional level of statistical significance but are especially cautious where results were only slightly below this, and we report 95% confidence intervals in preference to p-values.</P>

<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For statistically significant results we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% CI using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) taking account of the event rate in the control group.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>We preferred to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are problematic to interpret. If endpoint data were unavailable, we used change data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); (c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into the data analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and these were entered into syntheses.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This increases the risk of type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in an included study, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of an included study, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we will only use data from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1995</LINK>). These are described in section 10.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-02-02 14:09:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random-effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using fixed-effect models employing random-effects only when investigating heterogeneity.</P>

<P>If data are clearly statistically heterogeneous we first checked that data were correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit of analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point for if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. Instead we would have explored possible sources of heterogeneity. We do not pre-specify any characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except those relating to the quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods a random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted but plausible causes of heterogeneity, these post-hoc reasons will be discussed and the data analysed and presented. However, should the heterogeneity be substantially unaffected by use of random-effects meta-analysis and no other reasons for the heterogeneity be clear, the results of the individual trials would be presented without a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>If necessary, we analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis. We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they are described as 'double-blind' but only implied randomisation had taken place (but no such trials have been included in the 2009 update). If we found no substantive differences within primary outcome when these high attrition and 'implied randomisation' studies were added to the overall results, we included them in the final analysis. However, if there was a substantive difference, we excluded them and only included clearly randomised trials and those with attrition below 40%.</P>

<P>Patients in the intercessory prayer groups received relevant routine care plus daily intercessory prayer. The types of intercessory prayer varied slightly but all prayers were given with the intent that these intercessions would aid recovery of the patient.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5.1.1 Religious background of those interceding</HEADING>
<P>The religious background of the original researchers is likely to have affected their selection of interceders and was mentioned in some studies. <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> was undertaken by two researchers, one of whom started with the belief that prayer 'worked' and the other that it did not. The author of <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> recruited "...friends of ours in Washington..." to undertake the experimental intervention and concluded the article with the statement "every physician has prescribed this remedy [prayer] and nearly every physician has seen it succeed". <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> did not comment on the religious feelings of its authors.</P>
<P>All intercessors had religious belief but their background and level of religious activity varied. <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> accepted people as intercessors if they were "'born-again' Christians with an active Christian life as manifested by daily devotional prayer and active Christian fellowship with a local church.&#8221; In <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> intercessors were "friends of ours in Washington who [...] agreed to organize a prayer group." <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> stipulated two required conditions which needed to be fulfilled: (a) a willingness to accept up to six participant names and (b) residence more than 30 miles from the London Hospital. In <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> intercessors did not have to belong to any particular denomination, but needed to agree with the statements: "I believe in God. I believe that He is personal and is concerned with individual lives. I further believe that He is responsive to prayers for healing made on behalf of the sick". They also all reported at least weekly church attendance and daily prayer habits before the trial. The volunteers in <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1997</LINK> were initially recruited from the 'Albuquerque Faith Initiative', a community organisation designed to educate religious professionals and laity about substance abuse. They needed to report at least five years experience of intercessory prayer and believe that at least one prayer had been actively answered.</P>
<P>The remaining five studies were unclear about the level of religious activity previously undertaken by its intercessors. <LINK REF="STD-Aviles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aviles 2001</LINK> recruited from local religious groups and community interest meetings but stated the 'beliefs of intercessors was not quantified'. <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK> listed several off-site prayer groups (United School of Christianity, Buddhist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Fundamentalist Christian, Baptist and Moravian) but gave no other background information. <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> listed three Christian groups (St Pauls Monastery, Community of Tersian Carmelties and Silent Unity) but no further details. <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> was also unclear about religious background.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">5.1.2 Type of prayer given</HEADING>
<P>Apart from <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK>, prayer was undertaken daily in all studies. <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK> had a Jewish prayer which was placed on the Western Wall for the duration of the trial. One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, gave a specific phrase ("for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications") to be added to the daily prayer of the group.</P>
<P>Most trials used intercessors who prayed within the Judeo-Christian framework although they had a range of backgrounds: Protestant, Roman Catholic and other interdenominational bodies promoting Christian healing (Quakers and the Guild of Health). Intercessors in <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK> belonged to seven different nominations, or faiths (as above).</P>

Efforts were made in some studies to ensure daily prayer was maintained throughout the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> states that prayer was "under the direction of a co-ordinator", and in <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> intercessors received weekly reminders and participated in frequent discussions about their commitment (despite being unaware that they were participating in a study). Intercessors in <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> were randomly placed in groups of five members, each with a team leader. Prayer, however, was offered individually, not in groups. None of the intercessors in any trial personally knew the participant for whom they were praying.</P>

<P>Those in the control group received the routine care relevant to their setting, including the medication that would normally be given to people suffering from their particular illness. <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> provided "standard, uninterrupted medical care" for all the participant groups (rheumatic and psychological conditions) but no further details are available. <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> provided drug therapy for all participants (children with leukaemia). Each child received combinations of between two and five drugs (methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, prednisone, daunamycin, bis-chlorethyl-nitrosourea, cytosinearabioside, tryptophane mustard and fluorinated progesterone). In <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Aviles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aviles 2001</LINK> all participants were treated on the coronary care unit and the control groups received "usual or standard care".

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.1 Scales used</HEADING>
<P>The criteria for accepting scale data has changed since the original publication of this review. However, no trial in this review presents usable scale data from a valid scale which would be needed to meet this new criteria (see <LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK>). After discussion, therefore, we decided to retain the original data and discuss this below.</P>
<P>a. Clinical State Scale and Clinical Attitude Scale<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> employed these scales. As neither is referenced we assumed they have not been validated. Data from these scales, however, were graded into dichotomous positive or negative outcomes and as un-validated clinical opinion for these outcomes is acceptable for this review these too have been included. The Clinical State Scale graded changes in the participants' illness by an examination by a physician, from zero (very poor) to four (very good). We considered data from this scale to be similar to data from the Byrd score and therefore presented them as dichotomous data for Clinical state. The Attitude Scale was also used in a similar way and data from this scale are presented as dichotomous data for Behaviour. Data were categorised into 1. positive scores for (a) stoical; (b) positive and cooperative attitude; (zero for 'non-committal' attitude); and 2. negative scores for (a) apprehensive; and (b) critical and complaining.</P>
<P>b. Byrd Score (<LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>)<BR/>This was developed by <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> to assess clinical state. Clinical outcomes were categorised into 'good', 'intermediate' and 'bad'. It is not clear if those undertaking the categorisation were blind to the data at the time. The scoring system was based on the presence or absence of complications, for example a patient would be categorised 'good clinical state' if they had no or only one relatively unserious complication/s such as mild unstable angina, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia or mild congestive heart failure without pulmonary oedema. A patient would be categorised as 'bad' if they suffered from complications such as extension of initial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or death. A full list of categorisation of complications is given in the paper. <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> replicated this study and although they developed their own scoring system (MAIHU- CCU score, see below) they also used the Byrd score for clinical state to compare data. After discussion, we have accepted this use of the Byrd Score as a form of peer review and used data from the Byrd score.</P>
<P>c. Mid American Heart Institute-Cardiac Care Unit scoring system: MAHI-CCU score (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK>)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> created their own scoring system to categorise clinical state into good, intermediate or bad. The scoring system is a 'continuous variable that attempts to describe outcomes from excellent to catastrophic'. Points are given if a patient suffers from a complication and the severity of complications are graded, for example, if, after one day a patient developed unstable angina (one point) was treated with antiangian agents (one point) and then suffered a cardiac arrest (five points) their weighted MAHI-CCU score would be seven. Although the MAHI-CCU has not been peer reviewed, because this review was originally prepared before the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's change in its guidance on the use of data from scales, we decided to leave the data from the MAHI-CCU scoring system in this review but are aware it may be prone to bias because it is a scoring system created by the authors of the paper (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>d. Major Cardiovascular End Points (MACE) (<LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK>)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK> used MACE to assess the clinical state of their participants. Again, complications such as death, myocardial infarction congestive heart failure or bypass surgery were used as markers. We felt these were similar enough to the categories used by the above studies to categorise participants in <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK> with MACE as 'intermediate or bad' clinical state. <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> also used 'major events' (defined by the New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System) as an outcome, and again, we felt this data could be used in the same way.</P>
<P>6.2 Choosing 'significant complication'.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> those complications with statistically significant findings are re-highlighted in the text of the paper and it is these that are quoted elsewhere (AIDS daily summary). We asked an independent collaborator (Dr Evandro da Silva Freire Coutinho), blind to these data, to choose one 'complication' for presentation in the analysis. He chose 'readmission to Coronary Care Unit (CCU)'. As newly included studies also present data for complications we have kept this outcome as a 'primary significant complication' but also report data for other complications arising after treatment.</P>

The other three studies were randomised trials not using intercessory prayer as one of the interventions. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Galton-1883" TYPE="STUDY">Galton 1883</LINK>, as it was a retrospective study, although cited by <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK>.

A further three trials investigated the effect of specifically "non-contact therapeutic touch" for dermal healing (<LINK REF="STD-Wirth-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 1994a</LINK>), the results of non-traditional prayers on physiological measures (<LINK REF="STD-Wirth-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 1994b</LINK>), and "distance healing by volunteers trained in LeShan's meditation techniques" (<LINK REF="STD-Greyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Greyson 1997</LINK>). As a result of the update of February 2000, <LINK REF="STD-Sicher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sicher 1998</LINK> was excluded as the intervention was 'distance healing'. This technique may have included an element of prayer but did not specifically involve personal, focused, committed and organised intercessory prayer on behalf of another alone. <LINK REF="STD-Sicher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sicher 1998</LINK> is the published result of 'Targ 1993', which, in previous versions of this review, was listed as an 'Ongoing Study'.</P>

<P>All included studies were stated to be randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> stated that allocation was decided by the spin of a coin, <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> by randomly selecting names, and <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> by a computer generated list. In none of these studies was it stated that those in charge of allocation were blind as to what a 'heads or tails' of the spinning coin meant, to how the computer generated list was to be used or where the next name out of the bag was to go.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> had a rather unexpected method of randomisation. All new admissions to the CCU were identified daily in the chaplain's office, and these new patients were "randomly" assigned to either group by the chaplain's secretary based on the last digit of the medical record number; even numbers assigned to the prayer group, odd to 'usual care'. After some discussion we came to the conclusion that this method of allocation was adequate. Nevertheless, for every outcome that included data from <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> we undertook an analyses to investigate the sensitivity of the finding to removal of these data. The six studies added to the update were also all stated to be randomised and all described how this was achieved. <LINK REF="STD-Aviles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aviles 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1997</LINK> used computer programmes. <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> allocated participants by on-site envelopes and <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> used a random number generator.</P>

<P>Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> were not aware of their participation in a trial and the rater was unaware of the group to which each patient had been allocated. <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> obtained written consent from all participants but neither they nor those rating outcomes knew of their group allocation. In <LINK REF="STD-Collipp-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Collipp 1969</LINK> neither the children with leukaemia nor their parents knew of their inclusion in a trial and, in addition, all physicians were blinded. Even those praying were unaware that they were taking part in a study. <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> did not obtain written consent, so all participants may have been blind as we have found no report of them having given verbal consent. CCU staff, data collectors and statisticians involved in the studies were also blind to allocation. Five of the six new studies were double blind and described how this was achieved. In each case &#8220;double blind&#8221; was used to indicate that both the patient and the people responsible for their health care did not know whether the patient was in the prayer or the control group. Of note, <LINK REF="STD-Aviles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aviles 2001</LINK> stated that participants, care-givers and interviewers were blind to allocation. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> did not obtain consent from participants to maintain blindness - the intervention took place <I>after</I> the outcome. The study was double blind; those praying did not know the outcome for any of the patients. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, specifically told one group of participants they were receiving intercessory prayer while the other groups were uncertain of their allocation. This was to assess the effects of awareness of intercessory prayer on recovery. All carers and researchers were unaware of each patient's allocation in this trial.</P>
<P>We have not been able to extract data fully for the Risk of Bas table in this update (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) because of misplaced papers and the need to reach the deadline for publication.

<P>As outlined above (<LINK TAG="ALLOCATION" TYPE="SECTION">Allocation</LINK>) we did have some concerns as to whether <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> should be included. We included and excluded <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> from all outcomes for which that study reported data. In every case it tightened confidence intervals but made no substantive difference in the findings with a few exceptions. When synthesised with other data it tended to be conservative in its findings and make the findings less favourable for the intervention of intercessory prayer. The first exceptions are where all data for a given outcome are from the <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> study (anaemia/transfusion, atrial fibrillation, cardiopulmonary arrest, catheterization, implanted cardiac defibrillator, interventional coronary procedure, intra-aortic balloon pumpSwan-Ganz catheter). The second group of exceptions are where exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> does result in the finding changing from a null finding to one that becomes statistically significant in favour of prayer (congestive heart failure, diuretics, intubation/ventilation, major surgery before discharge, pneumonia).</P>
<P>We had not anticipated a study of prayer in which people prayed for those who had already had an outcome (albeit one unbeknownst to those intervening).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. INTERCESSORY PRAYER versus ROUTINE CARE</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Death</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the trial data show no more or no fewer deaths in the intercessory prayer group. There is no clear effect of this type of prayer, within these very unusual randomised trials. People of faith may speculate as to why this is so. There could be many plausible reasons when considered from this perspective. Those of no theological belief will also be able to use these data to support their hypotheses. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Clinical state</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2.1 Intermediate/poor outcome</HEADING>
<P>Five studies (n=2705) presented data relating to intermediate or poor outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK>). Results were equivocal and heterogeneous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>=78%). <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> carried most weight in this meta-analysis, and although this was a trial replicating <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, it found prayer to be less effective. <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> suggests this could be due to "important differences between the two study designs" (more stringent blinding, lack of informed consent possibly changing participant group, amount of participant information given to intercessors). It is also important to note that in <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> the point at which decisions were made relating to the definitions of 'good', 'intermediate' and 'poor' was not stipulated. It is not clear whether these important decisions were made before or after seeing the data and whether those doing the analysis were blind to group allocation. Therefore, bias may have influenced the result of the rather positive <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>. It is also interesting that <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, another large trial, also found less favourable results for prayer than the smaller trials. The outcomes of these two larger trials were different to the results of other prayer trials. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> received prayer for only 14 days and as the original authors noted, this may not be enough time for prayer to be effective. It may also be that the study measured an outcome which is not effected by prayer or that prayer has no effect at all.</P>
<P>Other problems with interpreting clinical state results are the use of non-published scales. In the protocol for this review we stated that only published scales would be reported in an attempt to avoid the presentation of invalid data. However, we were limited in that all data for this outcome came from scales for which the validation status is not clear. The Byrd score used by <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> was created by <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> and replicated by <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK>. We felt this was a form of 'peer review' and included these data but realise it could be prone to bias and more valid scale data are needed to confirm this result. The Clinical State Scale, as used in <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK>, is also not referenced and it is unclear if it is a valid measure of health or can be used with any degree of reliability. Data on this outcome are so positive that it may be widely quoted. Even if this scale is indeed a valid measure of health, such a result from a small trial (n=38) must be viewed with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Significant complications</HEADING>
<P>The presence of post operative complications was a main outcome in several trials. <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK> both presented long lists of possible complications. As noted above, we asked a colleague to choose a generic 'significant' complication blind to the data. He chose 'Readmission to Coronary Care Unit' and results from four studies (n=2644) found no overall difference in these readmissions.</P>
<P>Analysis of data from the list of specific complications found three out of 33 outcomes were statistically significant, all favouring prayer. However, the two studies presenting these data (<LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK>) presented results for such a long list of complications that statistical analysis was likely to highlight some as 'statistically significantly' improved by the use of prayer by chance alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 2008</LINK>). The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK> do state how multiple analysis of variables can lead to spurious 'significant' results but go on to re-report these in the text of the paper. It is these results that are then selectively quoted in other papers, leading to reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> did not present results for individual specific complications but summated data into 'presence of any complication' and found no effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 No change or deterioration in attitude</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1964</LINK> presented data from an unknown 'Attitude Scale' and the same arguments apply to this as to the Clinical State Scale (see above). Results are equivocal. Even if the Attitude Scale is a valid measure of attitude, the trial was too small to detect a difference unless it was very large.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.5 Service use</HEADING>
<P>No effect was found for any service use outcomes. There were no significant differences between groups for rehospitalisation (n=1155) or visits to emergency departments (n=1789).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.6 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>Six studies (n=3446) found no overall difference in the numbers leaving studies early. However, it might be better to regard this outcome as &#8220;loss to follow up&#8221; rather than leaving the study early because, in most trials, the patients were not aware that they were being studied.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. INTERCESSORY PRAYER (RETROSPECTIVE) versus ROUTINE CARE</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Death</HEADING>
<P>The purpose of this review is not to consider the putative means by which prayer may or may not be effective, but only to consider the results of well-constructed trials. <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> attempted to test the effects of such prayer and did not find any clear effect (n=3393, RR 0.93 CI 0.84 to 1.03). Retrospective prayer may be considered theologically controversial, but we are not concerned with theology. Our aim is to review the empirical evidence for the efficacy of prayer as a treatment for ill-health rather than to consider questions of metaphysics. We judge ourselves bound to analyse the results of any trial that fits our original criteria (including our initial definition of prayer) and which is methodologically well constructed. Having set our protocol we are convinced that it would be unscientific to modify it to exclude a study that fits our criteria for inclusion, for all it approaches this from an unusual angle.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>We understand that record keeping was complete so no one could leave the study in the conventional sense.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. AWARENESS OF INTERCESSORY PRAYER versus ROUTINE CARE</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK> found no significant effect for 'awareness of prayer' (where the participants were told and gave consent for intercessory prayer on their behalf, for their recovery from illness) for death, clinical state or leaving the study early. There was however, a significant effect favouring standard care for 'presence of post operative complications' (1 RCT, n=1198, RR 1.15 CI 1.04 to 1.28, NNH 14 CI 8 to 50). This result is from a single trial and needs replication if it is to be accepted. One suggestion, made by the original authors, as to why people not receiving prayer should have fewer postoperative complications than those who knew they were being prayed for is the limited time prayer was offered to those in the prayer group. This result, which is just statistically significant could also be due the play of chance when there is truly no difference between the groups or be a real, toxic effect of the knowledge that one is being prayed for.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. AWARENESS OF INTERCESSORY PRAYER versus UNCERTAINTY OF PRAYER</HEADING>
<P>Here the intervention 'awareness of prayer' is as above and those in the 'uncertainty of prayer' group were told they may or may not be the focus of intercessory prayer, by either an individual or group praying for their recovery from illness.</P>
<P>The single trial that investigated this, <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, found no significant differences between groups for any outcomes, except for presence of post operative complications (1 RCT, n=1205, RR 1.12 CI 1.01 to 1.24, NNH 17 CI 9 to 201). As above, this suggests that awareness of a person or group praying for you may have moderate untoward effects, but this finding needs replication if it is to be accepted.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 13:07:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is considerable interest relating to this widely used health care intervention and studies relevant to prayer and distance healing continue to be carried out, although we know of no ongoing studies directly relevant to this review. There are, however, a number of studies, at least as extensive in number as those included in this review, which deal with interventions of a spiritual nature not focused specifically on the supplication of God or a god. These include such practices as &#8216;distance healing&#8217;. We restricted our review to &#8216;intercessory prayer&#8217;, as widely understood and were limited by a lack of usable data within the included trials.</P>
<P>A further issue is that the healthcare conditions of the trial participants were diverse, although the majority did suffer from coronary disease (<LINK REF="STD-Aviles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aviles 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Byrd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Byrd 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krucoff--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krucoff 2001</LINK>). This could be a limitation or a strength, but all of the conditions were serious and life-threatening and we expect that the beneficial, harmful or non-existent effects of prayer should be similar across different health problems.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-02-16 13:15:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have not yet fully investigated the quality of the evidence arising from the trials in this review but we do not consider it to be radically different from what is common for randomised trials of, for example, drug interventions or psychological therapies. In some ways, the original researchers for these prayer trials have been more clear about their potential for bias and their prior beliefs than would be expected in a trial of a drug run by the pharmaceutical industry or of a psychological therapy run by a psychotherapist. Overall, the reporting of the included studies could have been improved and it is likely that all studies fall into a category of having at least a moderate risk of bias. For example, sequence generation, concealment, blinding were not well described in any of the studies and this poor description of these methodological parameters has been shown to be associated with an over estimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). Having said that, the overall estimates were non-significant so it is not clear how increasing the methodological quality of the evidence would have changed the result.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-15 13:42:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searching for these unusual studies is not easy. There is no clear place where they would be published or indexed. Several databases have been used but it is likely that we have missed some eligible trials. These are likely to be those studies that are smaller and more difficult to publish - and, perhaps less positive for prayer (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have excluded <LINK REF="STD-Cha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2001</LINK> from this version of the review because of the comments received feedback and knowledge gained by our own investigations. We may have been incorrect in doing this and still do not have proof that the study was bogus but the behaviour of the principal investigator raises concerns about its legitimacy which makes it safer to exclude it at this time.</P>
<P>We have also received comments suggesting that publication in the 2001 Christmas issue of the BMJ should preclude a study from inclusion because its methods or findings would be "jest" (<LINK TAG="FEEDBACK" TYPE="SECTION">Feedback</LINK>). We found no evidence that this was true. <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> is an unusual and original design - but it appears to have used a rigorous design, and, although a challenging study, it was conducted carefully and is presented respectfully. We do not agree that it should be regarded as a "jest" and excluded on those grounds but, as with all Cochrane reviews, we present its results explicitly and others may wish to remove it before conducting their own meta-analysis using the RevMan 5 data file which is available alongside this review. We do acknowledge that this study will pose philosophical problems for some readers. We aim not to involve ourselves in such philosophical discussions but to include all studies that tested empirical claims in a rigorous, empirical way.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people receiving health care</HEADING>
<P>The studies that have been done, reported and included in this review do not show a clear effect of intercessory prayer. However, because this review highlighted no clear effects does not mean that intercessory prayer does not work.

<P>The evidence presented so far is interesting enough to support further study. However, if resources were available for such a trial, we would probably use them elsewhere. There are many other treatments that are in urgent need of evaluation and that are likely to be more suited to investigation in a randomised trial.

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 12:27:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is riddled by serious flaws such as lack of critical appraisal of the included trials and findings, lack of a necessary discussion of the relevant sources of bias, and undue interference of theological reasoning. We list the most important problems:<BR/>
<BR/>1) The largest included study was published in the Christmas issue of the BMJ (1, which is characterized by articles written in jest. This was also the case for the study in question (2). It carries 75% of the weight in one of the main meta-analyses of the review where the authors report a statistically significant effect on death, relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.97. However, nowhere did the authors of the Cochrane review mention that this study evaluated the effect of prayer taking place 4-10 years after the patients had either left the hospital alive or had died from their bloodstream infection. Thus, the study randomised dead patients and then studied whether they were dead or alive. The authors argued that we cannot assume "...that God is limited by a linear time".<BR/>
<BR/>2) One of their methodological reservations are also encountered within alternative medicine where the true benefit of an intervention often seems to escape what is measurable in a scientific setting: &#8220;If understanding of God is as limited as the Holy Literature suggests (1 Corinthians 13:12), the consequences of divine intervention may be considerably more subtle than could be measured in the crude results of a trial&#8221;, and &#8220;It could be that any effect of prayer are due to elements beyond present scientific understanding&#8221;. If these are real concerns for the authors, they should not have undertaken the review at all and their reservations also disagree with the stated premises for the review, that only non-divine effects were to be assessed. This theological reservation is no more applicable to a scientific investigation of prayer than to trials of any other medical intervention, as a God may also intervene in these cases.<BR/>
<BR/>3) The theological reasoning leads the authors to untenable statements, e.g. &#8220;A caring God may not wish to prolong suffering, so death therefore might be a positive outcome of prayer&#8221;. This is a perfect immunization of the hypothesis that will make any trial of prayer meaningless. If people survive, it is good for them, and if they die, it is also good for them.<BR/>
<BR/>4) The authors found one study that reported an increased risk of surgical complications due to prayer, but only if the patients are aware that people pray for their improved health (relative risk 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.28). Instead of discussing the plausibility of this finding, and the finding that knowledge of the intervention did not affect the other positive outcomes in this review, e.g. increased chance of successful in-vitro fertilisation, the authors conclude that people intervening with prayer should be &#8220;cautious about informing the recipient&#8221; when it comes to surgery and that managers and policymakers may wish to exercise some caution about &#8220;praying at the bedside of those who are about to have a surgical operation&#8221;.<BR/>
<BR/>5) When discussing the effect of prayer on what the authors call &#8220;clinical state&#8221;, they attempt to explain the lack of effect as being because the participants only received prayer for 14 days, which may not have been enough for prayer to be effective. The authors do not mention the far more plausible interpretation that the lack of effect of prayer is because prayer has no effect.<BR/>
<BR/>This review does not live up to the scientific standards one can reasonably expect of a Cochrane review. The review as currently published should be withdrawn from the Cochrane Library, not least because it suggests that all scientific studies are meaningless, as we will never know whether one or more gods intervened in our carefully planned experiments.<BR/>

<P>The Editorial Base and the Comments Editor of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group do wish to apologise to those sending the comment on the &#8216;Intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health&#8217; review which appeared in Issue 1 of 2009. This comment was erroneously attributed to &#8220;Peter C. Gøtzsche - Director, Nordic Cochrane Center at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark&#8221; and should read, as it does now, &#8220;Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, Asbjørn Hrobjartsson, Peter C. Gøtzsche&#8221;.</P>
<P>We regret that the feedback finds problems with this review, even to the extent in one case of saying that the review is 'riddled with serious flaws'. We have made every effort to make such corrections as we think were justified and thank those commenting for highlighting them. We have addressed them in the same order as appears above.</P>
<P>1. Comments made about the Christmas issue of the BMJ and the <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> study in particular are not fully accurate. Several articles in the late December issues of the BMJ are written with humour and some in pure spoof. Most are not. They may be written with humour and have an odd perspective, but are, nevertheless, interesting and well thought out research. The <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> was not in jest. It is a rather serious paper, intended as a challenge (<A HREF="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/323/7327/1450">direct link to comments</A>).</P>
<P>2. Our brief theological discussions were meant to be illustrative of some of the wider academic background to these questions and were not intended to relate to the studies themselves. We note that this distinction could be taken further and have attempted in this revision to make a clearer distinction between philosophical or theological background and the entirely empirical matter under discussion.</P>
<P>3. We do not feel that it would benefit the purposes of this review to argue the point brought to the fore by the commentators. We have tried to state the evidence - about outcomes such as death - and let the readers draw their own conclusions. Perhaps we have been unsuccessful in that - and for this we would wish to apologise. We are, however, aware that readers will differ as to how they perceive the data, and the phrase highlighted by the comment illustrates this. The comment suggests that some paths of logic may make trials of prayer meaningless. Whether we agree or disagree is not important. These trials have been undertaken and, we still feel, merit thoughtful review.</P>
<P>4. We accept these points and have tried to reword the relevant passages.</P>
<P>5. The commentators are right in highlighting this shortcoming and we have addressed it in the text. We are unsure upon what the commentators base their claim of plausibility and suspect that such a sweeping claim is based in faith.</P>
<P>We disagree that this review does not live up to the scientific standards one can reasonably expect of a Cochrane review. It is a complex review, and like many others has been and remains imperfect. With successive revisions we endeavour to improve it.</P>
<P>We disagree that this review should be withdrawn: prayer is a very widely used intervention in response to ill-health, the studies are judged on their merits and our analysis is sound.</P>
<P>We regret that we have caused some commentators to suppose that we were suggesting that "all scientific studies are meaningless". We are also a little perplexed by this response. We strongly believe otherwise.</P>
<P>Similarly, we are sorry that some commentators feel that this review merits censoring on the grounds that they perceive it to be suggesting "all scientific studies are meaningless, as we will never know whether one or more gods intervened in our carefully planned experiments". We have proceeded on the basis that empirical claims are made for prayer and that these can be empirically tested.</P>

<P>I corresponded with Leanne Roberts (author) in 2007 by email.  This feedback's an encapsulation of the main points of that email exchange. The IVF study cited has been debunked and reference to it ought to be withdrawn. There are several excellent papers explaining why intercessory prayer cannot be studied using a RCT, rendering meta-analyses of RCTs meaningless. (<LINK REF="REF-Chibnall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chibnall 2001</LINK> is one of the best but there are many others - email me for a more complete list). Please can this review be overhauled, emphasising that RCTs of prayer are meaningless and that scientific study of prayer ought to be limited to its social effects ideally using qualitative methodologies? There's a lot of pseudoscience being done in this area. Thanks.</P>

<P>Dr Jackson makes two separate points. The first concerns the Cha study (<LINK REF="STD-Cha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2001</LINK>). We are in agreement with him. Where there is justified dispute as to methodology or scholarly integrity we will exclude studies from the review. Consequently, this study was removed from the last substantial update in Issue 2, 2009 of the Cochrane Library. </P>
<P>Dr Jackson's second point is more wide-ranging. We agree with him in opposing surveys that are undertaken for the purpose of proving or disproving a prior commitment. He suggests that other reviewers in this field have undertaken to &#8216;ignore papers, or cherry-pick perceived weak points&#8217;. If this is so then we join with him in his disapproval. This is, however, a serious accusation. Dr Jackson&#8217;s willingness to classify authors in this field widely as either &#8216;pro-IP&#8217; (intercessory prayer) or as &#8216;anti-IP&#8217; is, in our opinion, too extensive a charge. For our part, in identifying and analysing studies for this review we have sought to use scrupulously objective standards. We therefore see ourselves for the purpose of the review as neither &#8216;pro-&#8217; nor &#8216;anti-IP&#8217;.  </P>
<P>Dr Jackson urges us to include &#8216;an argument against further IP studies being performed&#8217; in the future. It seems that there are two possible reasons for taking such a position. First, that the scientific results show IP to have been disqualified or confirmed with a very high degree of certainty. The results are by no means conclusive enough for us to urge such a course on this basis. A second reason for stopping studies of IP would be that it is inherently flawed to use randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate this subject. This point deserves more detailed consideration. </P>
<P>Arguments for or against the applicability of RCTs for IP rest upon prior, conceptual commitments of a theological nature. We take any discussion of the &#8216;god&#8217; under consideration to be &#8216;theological&#8217;. One has to have a sense of the entity one is talking about, and its relationship to the world, regardless of whether one believes in its existence or not. </P>
<P>Some of those who have written on divine agency conceive of God[1] and intercessory prayer in a way that raises serious questions about the legitimacy of RCTs in these studies. Others, however, have understood God and the mechanics of intercessory prayer in a way that makes sense of studying IP in this way. For instance, RCTs might well investigate the action of God understood as a relatively limited being among beings. There might be problems if we understand God as beyond time and space and as omniscient. </P>
<P>It is not possible to rule upon the validity of RCTs for IP without taking a particular line on these questions. We cannot agree with Dr Jackson that studies of this kind should be ruled out, simply because this cannot be recommended without making assumptions of a philosophical and theological nature, whether theistic or atheistic. Such assumptions might provide valid personal motivation in the case of the involvement of the individual scientist. They cannot be a reason for a journal to rule out a meta-analysis. </P>
<P>Laying aside theological-metaphysical questions for the sake of our review, we are simply left with a set of empirical studies that can be judged on their merits as RCTs, and subjected to careful meta-analysis. As it happens, the theological-philosophical convictions of at least one of the authors involved in our review disposes them against the use of RCTs for investigating IP. He or she holds that this must be put to one side and wishes to examine the empirical evidence as empirical evidence. </P>
<P>In conclusion, we do not think that one could rule out further RCTs for IP on <I>a priori</I> grounds separate from &#8216;theological&#8217; assumptions as to the properties of the God in which one does or does not believe. One could not urge for these studies to be discontinued on <I>a priori</I> grounds without bringing theological ideology into science. IP may be studied by empirical means until such time the empirical findings themselves suggest an end to the studies.</P>
<P>[1] In this discussion we refer to &#8216;God&#8217;; we are, however, deliberately agnostic, and this could as easily be taken to refer to &#8216;gods&#8217;.</P>

<P>In the updated Cochrane review of intercessory prayer (1), the authors have chosen not to exclude a study,<LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK>(2) that we have shown to be unfit for inclusion (3).</P>
<P> In the updated review, the authors noted that: <I>&#8216;We have also received comments suggesting that publication in the 2001 Christmas issue of the BMJ should preclude a study from inclusion because its methods or findings would be "jest". We found no evidence that this was true.&#8217;</I>
</P>
<P> This seems to be part misquotation, part neglect. We have not suggested that publication in the Christmas issue of BMJ in general precludes inclusion of studies in Cochrane reviews (3). However, we do think it is problematic to include a study written in jest if there is evidence in favour of this. That was the case for the <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> study. We provided the evidence in our first response to the Cochrane review in a reference to a rapid response in the BMJ. Leibovici clearly described his trial as a &#8216;non-study&#8217; and emphasised that his aim was not to test intercessory prayer, but to illustrate the limitations of which interventions can be sensibly tested in randomised trials:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<I>&#8216;() if the pre-trial<SUP> </SUP>probability is infinitesimally low, the results of the trial will<SUP> </SUP>not really change it, and the trial should not be performed. This,<SUP> </SUP>to my mind, turns the article into a non-study, although the details<SUP> </SUP>provided in the publication (randomisation done only once, statement<SUP> </SUP>of a wish, analysis, etc) are<SUP> </SUP>correct. The article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe<SUP> </SUP>it should be tested in controlled<SUP> </SUP>trials.&#8217;</I> (4)</P>
<P> The review authors should therefore have had easy access to evidence that our assertion of the <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK> study is correct.</P>
<P> We recently wrote to authors of articles published in the BMJ Christmas issue to clarify the intentions behind them and investigate if they were given undue weight when they were subsequently quoted (5). The authors, including Leibovici, were given two options and could characterise their study as either:</P>
<P> A)  a serious study (conducted to answer a scientific question, and could have been published in another scientific journal), or<BR/>
<BR/>B)  a spoof study (written specifically for the BMJ Christmas issue with no attempt of addressing the proposed scientific question, but with an implicit ironic or tongue-in-cheek objective).&#8221; </P>
<P> The answer from Leibovici was unmistakable: &#8216;Certainly B - although the details of the 'study' that was done (basically dividing an old database into 2 random parts and comparing them) were described correctly in the article.&#8217; Not all authors of papers in the BMJ Christmas issue chose option B, however.</P>
<P> We suggest a prompt amendment to the review with an exclusion of the Leibovici study.</P>

<P>We note the further comment from our colleagues in Denmark, who continue to argue against the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Leibovici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leibovici 2001</LINK>. The objectives of the original trialists when they complete a study must not influence its inclusion in a review for which the methods of the study make it eligible. To ensure that Cochrane reviews are rigorous they are preceded by a protocol &#8211; as was the case with this particular review. This protocol was open to comment and criticism. We received no comments on the inclusion criteria. It is clearly not part of the reviewers' remit to judge the motivation of those conducting eligible trials. We are satisfied that we have applied our protocol as objectively and rigorously as possible. We are keen that all studies meeting the clearly stated inclusion criteria should be reported (even if later stated to have been "written in jest"), rather than being kept hidden and perpetuating publication bias.</P>

<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution or journal of publication.<BR/>
<BR/>The principal reviewer (LR) inspected all reports. These were then re-inspected by IA in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where there was still doubt, we obtained the full article for further inspection. Once we had obtained the full articles, LR and IA decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials included in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below:<BR/>
<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, we included trials if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.<BR/>
<BR/>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scales include three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?<BR/>
<BR/>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Data collection<BR/>LR independently extracted data from selected trials, while IA separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose we attempted arose resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so they could not be analysed as such.<BR/>
<BR/>4.2 Incomplete data<BR/>We did not include trial outcomes if more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data<BR/>We used an 'intention to treat' analysis. On the condition that more than 60% of people completed the study, everyone allocated to the intervention were counted, whether they completed the follow up or not. We assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible, we tried to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut-off point for determining clinical effectiveness this was used by the reviewers where appropriate. Otherwise we generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response.<BR/>
<BR/>We calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that, RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected data to see if an analysis using a fixed-effect model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference.<BR/>
<BR/>4.4 Continuous data<BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.<BR/>
<BR/>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we presented only endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data were excluded, but argue that endpoint data are more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We have contacted authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures. We reported non-normally distributed data in the 'other data types' tables.<BR/>
<BR/>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) is associated with bias; therefore we excluded the results of such scales. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, we included such data but commented on the data as 'prone to bias'.<BR/>
<BR/>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, we presented both sets of data and inspected the general direction of effect.<BR/>
<BR/>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups, again based on the random-effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.<BR/>
<BR/>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we undertook consideration of all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented these separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.<BR/>
<BR/>7. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for prayer.<BR/>
