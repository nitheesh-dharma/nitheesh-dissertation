<P>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is characterised by the development of cancerous cells in the milk ducts of the breast and is commonly diagnosed by mammography screening. Surgical removal of the breast offers a good prognosis, however many women and clinicians prefer breast conserving surgery (BCS), the removal of the DCIS plus a rim of normal breast tissue, as there is no guarantee that DCIS will progress to invasive cancer. This approach means that most of the normal breast is saved. The main risk of inadequately removing all the DCIS is either a recurrence of DCIS or the development of invasive breast cancer at a later time with the risk that this can progress to metastatic disease (cancer that has spread). Radiotherapy (RT) is treatment using ionising radiation. Giving RT after BCS is thought to reduce the risk of developing recurrent disease (either DCIS or invasive breast cancer).</P>
<P>This review aimed to assess both the benefit of adding RT to treatment and any potential long or short-term harm it may cause. Short-term harm includes skin rash and redness, or inflammation of lung tissue. Potential long-term side effects from RT include vascular disease (heart and major blood vessel disease), damage to the lungs, development of lung cancer, or osteoradionecrosis (bone damage resulting in bone death). </P>
<P>The review identified four large randomised controlled trials (3925 women) that compared treatment with breast conserving surgery alone and breast conserving surgery with the addition of RT. The addition of RT reduced the risk of a recurrence of either DCIS or invasive cancer in the treated breast by 51%. </P>
<P>Older trials of breast conserving surgery followed by RT for invasive breast cancer have shown long-term toxicity from the addition of RT. We found no evidence of increased toxicity from the use of RT although some trials did not report on the causes of non-breast cancer deaths (deaths which potentially could be related to side effects). The number of non-breast cancer deaths reported were similar in both radiotherapy and control groups. Changes in delivery of RT between older and more recent trials and a subsequent decrease in exposure of normal tissue may account for this finding. Longer follow up of trial participants is required before a definite conclusion can be drawn, however radiotherapy techniques are continuing to improve and future patients are likely to experience a further decrease in exposure of nearby normal tissues. Overall survival was high and similar between each group whether radiotherapy was used or not. There were no reports of short-term toxicity from use of radiotherapy, or quality of life data.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-12 10:48:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 16:12:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a pre-malignant condition defined by Harris et al as "a group of closely related lesions whose common histological feature is the proliferation of cancer cells within the ducts without invasion of the surrounding stromal tissue" (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>). DCIS is a precursor to invasive breast cancer. There are shared chromosomal changes between adjacent in situ and invasive cancers that demonstrate their clonal, evolutionary relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Burstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burstein 2004</LINK>). It is estimated that up to 35% of individuals with DCIS may develop an invasive carcinoma over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>DCIS itself presents a very low risk of metastatic disease. However, about half the subsequent local recurrences (recurrence in the same area) will be invasive. For an invasive recurrence there is a 15% to 20% risk of metastatic disease at eight years (<LINK REF="REF-Solin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solin 2001</LINK>) and reduced survival. The 8-year rate of breast cancer specific mortality reported by Silverstein et al (<LINK REF="REF-Silverstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstein 1998</LINK>) for 35 patients with an invasive local recurrence was 14.4%.</P>
<P>DCIS is not normally palpable (<LINK REF="REF-NBCC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCC 2003</LINK>) and prior to the introduction of widespread mammographic screening programmes the proportion of patients diagnosed with breast cancer who had DCIS was relatively small. DCIS is often found before clinical symptoms in women attending screening mammography by detection of microcalcifications or a soft-tissue density, or both. Screening has increased the numbers of women diagnosed with DCIS from around 4% of all breast biopsies to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Millikan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millikan 1995</LINK>) and DCIS now accounts for 20% to 30% of all mammographically detected breast cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Mokbel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokbel 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall rate of breast cancer recurrence, including ipsilateral (the same breast) and contralateral (the other breast) disease, is 1% to 2% for all women diagnosed with DCIS. For those women diagnosed with DCIS who have mastectomy the rate is 0.5% to 1% per year in the contralateral breast (either DCIS or invasive disease). After breast conserving surgery the local recurrence rate is approximately 16% at five years, which reduces to approximately 8% with the addition of radiotherapy (RT) (<LINK REF="REF-Burstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burstein 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several factors are postulated to be associated with an increased risk of a local recurrence after BCS and RT. The strongest factor is whether DCIS has been completely excised or not. Margins that are clear or are greater than 1 mm from the margin are associated with a lower risk of local recurrence than those with margins that are either involved or less than 1 mm in width.</P>
<P>Another factor associated with a higher risk of local recurrence is age (less than 40 years); however surgical margins, higher tumour grade, or necrosis and more advanced clinical disease are all possible confounders. Pathological features that may increase the risk of local recurrence are higher grade DCIS, especially with the presence of comedo necrosis (larger, faster growing, consisting of a higher nuclear grade and more likely to produce micro-invasion), and an area of DCIS greater than 4 cm. Presentation of more advanced disease with clinical symptoms such as a palpable mass or nipple discharge, rather than a screen-detected lesion, is also associated with a higher local recurrence risk.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-12 10:48:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>When post-operative RT is used after breast conserving surgery, the standard dose of RT that is administered in tangential fields is 44 to 50 Gray (Gy) delivered to the whole breast in fractions of 180 to 200 cGy on a daily basis. Some patients may receive a boost to the site of DCIS (a higher dose of radiation than the dose given to the surrounding breast tissue). A boost to the tumour site has been shown to reduce the risk of a local recurrence for patients who have an invasive breast cancer, and this technique has been extrapolated to use for DCIS (<LINK REF="REF-Burstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burstein 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-21 15:40:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Little is known of the natural history of DCIS. It is not possible to identify which cases of DCIS will progress to invasive cancer but estimates indicate that women who have had DCIS are four to 12 times more likely to develop subsequent invasive breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-NBCC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCC 2003</LINK>). In terms of management, mastectomy presents a near total avoidance of recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2002</LINK>) without the need for RT but requires more surgery.</P>
<P>RT is frequently used because of the potential risk of recurrence following breast conserving surgery. Randomised controlled trials have shown a lower risk of recurrence with this approach. What remains unclear is the balance between reducing recurrence with potential long-term and short-term harms due to RT. The decision to choose mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery followed by RT involves consideration of the psychological impact of having a mastectomy as well as the reduction in risk of disease recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Reaby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaby 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>All patients spend a significant amount of time attending hospital for treatment, which impacts on daily life. Short-term complications of RT include the temporary discomfort of a skin reaction (such as a rash or redness) and radiation pneumonitis. The recognised long-term complications from RT following breast conserving surgery for DCIS would be similar to those following surgery for invasive breast cancer since RT for DCIS follows the same treatment protocol as for invasive breast cancer. These include a modest increase in vascular deaths (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2000</LINK>), pulmonary toxicity including lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis (a persistent cough or breathlessness), and contralateral breast cancer. It is also recognised that the newer RT techniques in use today, such as conformal fields, result in a lower RT dose to the surrounding normal tissues and may result in fewer long-term complications. Over the last 10 to 15 years, RT technique improvements have reduced the incidence of pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, and in all probability vascular problems.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, important to evaluate whether the addition of RT to breast conserving surgery influences both local recurrence and overall survival. It is also important to weigh up benefits in terms of local control and survival with the side effects experienced with this treatment.</P>
<P>There has been no direct prospective randomised controlled trial comparing breast conserving surgery with mastectomy for DCIS. There have been four large randomised controlled trials comparing breast conserving surgery alone with the addition of radiotherapy. These are the NSABP B-17, EORTC10853, UKCCCR, and SweDCIS trials. All concur that the addition of radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence in all subgroups.</P>
<P>Other recent changes to radiotherapy include the addition of a boost to the site of DCIS, which is especially used for patients with involved margins.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register search (17th January 2008) identified 35 potentially eligible trials. The search of CENTRAL identified 150 potentially eligible trials, the MEDLINE search identified 124 potentially eligible trials, and the EMBASE search identified 307 potentially eligible trials. The review of conference abstracts and reference lists did not identify any additional trials. Two authors (AG and NW) read the Journal of Clinical Oncology and identified a more recent update of the results of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) that was not identified as part of the search strategy.

<P>The presence of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for ipsilateral breast recurrence for three trials (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) and summary statistics (HR, the 95% confidence interval (CI) and observed events in each group) for the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) made pooled analysis of the HR possible using the methods published by Parmar (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). We calculated the HR and its associated variance for each of the four trials for all ipsilateral breast events and pooled this result using RevMan 5. The pooled HR for all ipsilateral breast events (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) was statistically significant in favour of RT (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Individual trial results were all consistent with the pooled HR for all ipsilateral breast events. The EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) found the 10-year local relapse-free rate was 85% with adjuvant radiotherapy compared to 74% without (HR 0.53, log rank P &lt; 0.001). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) found the absolute risk of all ipsilateral events was reduced by 8.9% (from 13.7% in the control group to 4.8% in the RT group). The SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) found the absolute risk reduction was 16% at 10 years, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 0.40 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.54), for all ipsilateral breast events. The NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>) found the cumulative incidence of all ispilateral events at 12 years was 31.7% in the control group compared to 15.7% in the RT group (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.58, P &lt; 0.000005).</P>
<P>There were Kaplan-Meier survival curves for ipsilateral invasive recurrence for two of the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>). The pooled HR for ipsilateral invasive recurrence (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) was statistically significant (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76, P = 0.001). The pooled results of the two trials showed a trend towards benefit which was consistent with each individual trial's result. The EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) found the risk of invasive local recurrence was reduced by 42% (P = 0.0065). The NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>) found that invasive breast tumour recurrence was reduced from 16.8% to 7.7% (P &lt; 0.0001) (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.59, P &lt; 0.00001). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) found that the HR for use of RT and incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease was 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.85, P = 0.01); in absolute terms reduced from 5.3% to 2.5%. The SweDCIS (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) found ipsilateral invasive disease was reduced from 12.3% to 7.2%.</P>
<P>There were Kaplan-Meier survival curves for ipsilateral DCIS recurrence for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>). The pooled HR for ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) was just stastically significant in favour of RT (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.95, p=0.03). This was consistent with each individual trial result. The NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>) found the incidence of non-invasive ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was reduced from 14.6% to 8.0% (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76, P = 0.001). The EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) found the risk of non-invasive recurrence was reduced by 48% (P = 0.0011); in absolute terms from 14% to 7%. The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) found the HR for ipsilateral DCIS was 0.36 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.66, P = 0.0001). The SweDCIS (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) found ipsilateral DCIS was reduced from 14.8% to 4.9%.</P>
<P>All trials reported excellent survival in both the RT and control groups. In the NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>), overall survival was 86% (control) compared to 87% (RT) at 12 year follow up. In the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>), 10-year survival was 95% in both groups, and 10-year metastasis free survival 96% in both groups. SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) did not report survival but the number of women with either breast cancer death or other death was similar in each group (8.4% in the RT group compared to 9.6% in the control group, corresponding to a survival of 92% and 90% respectively). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) did not report survival according to randomisation to RT or not; including all trial participants (not all randomised to RT) survival was 97.9% in the control group and 96.2% in the RT group.</P>
<P>Contralateral breast events were similar in both RT and control groups for all trials. In the NSABP trial (NSABP 1998) rates were 3.3% in the control group and 5.7% in the RT group (overall 3% invasive and 1.5% non-invasive). Both groups were combined for the 12 year follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>). In the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) rates were 5.6% in the control group and 7.7% in the RT group (95% CI 0.87 to 2.30, P = 0.16). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) found similar contralateral breast event rates (2%) in each group (HR 0.82, P = 0.65). SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) reported 6.5% with contralateral breast carcinoma in the RT arm and 5.9% in the control arm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analysis of benefit</HEADING>
<P>The EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) and SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) both conducted subgroup analyses of the benefit from RT. The EORTC trial found using multivariate analysis that young age (40 years or less), intermediately or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribiform or solid growth pattern, or doubtful margins were risk factors for recurrence; all subgroups benefited from addition of RT. The SweDCIS trial found (on subgroup analysis) minimal benefit for RT in women under the age of 50 years (who had a 6% risk reduction) but marked benefit for RT in women over age 60 years (with an 18% risk reduction) that was not confounded by focality, lesion size, completeness of excision, or detection mode. A separate report from the NSABP trial (1999) found a benefit for RT in all groups according to the pathological feature studied, but the presence or absence of comedo necrosis was an independent predictor of recurrence risk. When moderate or marked comedo necrosis was present the RR was 0.30, compared to a RR of 0.52 in its absence.</P>
<P>We planned to analyse the benefit of RT in the following subgroups: whether DCIS was completely excised or not, young age or older age, and the presence or absence of comedo necrosis. We performed an unplanned analysis based upon lesion less than 10mm compared to greater or equal to 10mm of DCIS.</P>
<P>No subgroup information was provided for the UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Information regarding completeness of excision was available for 2272 women: 73.5% of participants in the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>), 70.8% of participants in the NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>), and 89.2% of participants in the SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>). Data were extracted and pooled for these partipants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). In the group with incomplete excision the calculated RR was 0.55 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.78, P = 0.001), and with complete excision the RR was 0.48 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.59, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>The trials defined young age differently. The EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) reported data for women under or over age 40 years. In the small group of 41 women under 40 years, the HR calculated from reported summary statistics was 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.88, P = 0.03) and for women over age 40 years the HR was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.81, P = 0.001). The NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>) and SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) reported data on women under or over age 50 years. Data were pooled for these two trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). For women under age 50 years the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.93, P = 0.02) and for women over age 50 years the RR was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.46, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Ipsilateral breast event rates according to histological subtype were available for two trials: the NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>), available for 83.1% of trial participants; and the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>), available for 76.4% of trial participants. Data were pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>) and a benefit from RT was found both in the presence and absence of comedo necrosis. In the presence of comedo necrosis the overall RR was 0.44 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.59, P &lt; 0.00001). In the absence of comdeo necrosis the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.81, P = 0.0009). The SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) reported on a cohort of 271 women (25.4% of trial participants): if comedo necrosis was present the HR was 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.67), and if comedo necrosis was absent the HR was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.42) with P = 0.068 for the test for interaction.</P>
<P>Ipsilateral breast event rates were calculated based upon the size of the original tumour as an unplanned analysis in response to requests for this information. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>) had reports of the trials which included event rates for ipsilateral breast events based on DCIS size and data were pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). This information was available for 1742 of the 3925 participants (44.4%). The size of DCIS was less than 10 mm for 903 participants and greater or equal to 10 mm for 839 participants. For DCIS less than 10mm the HR was 0.43 (0.30 to 0.61). For DCIS greater than or equal to 10 mm the HR was 0.32 (0.22 to 0.46).</P>

<P>Toxicity was an outcome of interest and all four trials were assessed for this information. For the UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>), toxicity data were not provided for the intervention and control groups but only for the whole group of 1694 participants. Attempts to contact trial investigators were not successful. Information about cause of death was not reported for non-breast cancer death for the SweDCIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-SweDCIS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">SweDCIS 2008</LINK>). Contact was made with a trial investigator and this information is not yet available. Overall, there was a low number of deaths in each of the four trials. It is recognised that longer follow up will increase the incidence of any long-term toxicity. Median follow up for ranged from 4.4 years to 10.5 years for the four trials.</P>
<P>Three trials had information about the cause of non-breast cancer deaths. There were seven deaths due to vascular causes in the NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>), six in the control arm and one in the RT arm; the first report of the EORTC trial (EORTC 2000) reported two vascular deaths (one in each arm) and subsequently (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>) reported seven vascular deaths (arm not specified). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) reported six vascular deaths. There were no reports of pulmonary toxicity in any of the trials. Reports of a second cancer did not always specify the type of malignancy. In the NSABP trial (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP 2001</LINK>), one woman died of either lung cancer or metastatic breast cancer (could not be determined); 18 second cancers occurred in the control group, including two lung cancers and three endometrial cancers; and 20 second cancers occurred in the RT group, including one lung cancer, one oesophageal cancer, one bone cancer, one soft tissue cancer, two endometrial cancers and one cancer in the lymph nodes. In the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 2006</LINK>), there was one mediastinal lymphoma (RT arm) in the first EORTC trial report (EORTC 2000) and in the subsequent report there were 13 malignancies other than breast cancer (type and arm of study not specified). The UKCCCR trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKCCCR-2003" TYPE="STUDY">UKCCCR 2003</LINK>) reported nine deaths due to another malignancy (type and arm of study not specified). There were no reports of osteoradionecrosis in any trial.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-12 10:06:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This systematic review has confirmed the individual trial results for a benefit of adding RT to breast conserving surgery for DCIS. Results confirm a statistically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast events using data extracted and pooled from four trials that were identified by a comprehensive search strategy (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58, P &lt; 0.00001). All four trials were large multicentre trials with excellent randomisation procedures, use of allocation concealment, and intention-to-treat analysis. Blinding of treatment was not done and is not appropriate for an intervention trial using RT. There was no heterogeneity present between trials.</P>
<P>The characteristics of women included in these four trials reflect the population of women commonly diagnosed with DCIS (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In these studies, the majority of women had DCIS diagnosed by screening mammography and which was clinically impalpable. The reported median ages of women were just over 50 years. This further strengthens the applicability of the results of this meta-analysis to most women seen in clinics for treatment of DCIS.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-12 14:11:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The validity of our results is high due to the quality of the included studies and our comprehensive search strategy. Two smaller trials were identified whose results are not yet available but, when available, these results are unlikely to influence the overall result. It is possible that unpublished eligible trials are reported in conference abstracts which were not included in the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register or handsearched and potentially could be missed by our search strategy. We welcome contact by any trial investigators if this is the case. We feel it is unlikely there are any other trials with sufficient patient numbers to influence our results. A small number of trial participants were excluded from analysis in some of the included trials but all participants were accounted for. This is, therefore, unlikely to influence any of the trial results.</P>
<P>The benefit from the addition of RT to breast conserving surgery was homogeneous between each individual trial and was confirmed on extraction and pooling of data. The following subgroups were planned for analysis prior to our review; young age compared to older age, presence of marked or moderate comedo necrosis compared to its absence, and complete surgical excision of DCIS compared to incomplete excision. Pooling of results for all of these subgroups showed benefit from the use of RT.</P>
<P>Data were available for extraction from two trials regarding recurrent ipsilateral DCIS and recurrent ipsilateral invasive disease (a total of 1848 participants). Even with reduced patient numbers and a lower event rate, there was a benefit from RT for ipsilateral invasive disease and for recurrent ipsilateral DCIS, the benefit for RT was just statistically significant. A benefit for the addition of RT was seen whether the size of the DCIS lesion was small (less than 10 mm) or large (greater than or equal to 10 mm).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-22 10:45:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>To assess the balance between the benefit from RT and possible toxicity from treatment, the cause of death was assessed for all studies. Overall, long-term harm was not well reported in these trials. With the available information, there was no evidence of excess deaths attributable to the addition of RT, either due to vascular disease, pulmonary toxicity, or second malignancies. Rate of death due to any cause was low in both arms of all trials and was similar between trials. However, if long-term toxicity due to RT does occur, a longer follow-up period may be required to show such an effect. The actual development of disease (such as vascular disease or malignancy) was not reported, only cause of death. As RT techniques continue to improve, exposure of nearby normal tissues is reduced and any long-term harm associated with the use of RT may be reduced even further for future patients. A reassuring finding was no reporting of excess deaths in the RT arm compared to the group treated by surgery alone.</P>
<P>Short-term toxicity and quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. This review was not able to assess therefore the impact of any potential short-term harm from treatment with radiotherapy. Short term side effects of radiation therapy have however been well reported. In future it would be beneficial to women undergoing this treatment to have access to comprehensive information concerning these, and the outcomes of different treatment options which impact on quality of life and influence complex psychosocial treatment decisions. This may be studied in non-randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>This result confirms the benefit of radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery for DCIS and supports its use for all women as the overall benefit was large and all subgroups analysed showed benefit for the use of radiotherapy. There was no reported long-term toxicity from the use of radiotherapy and no excess deaths from any cause were reported in the groups treated with radiotherapy. Short term toxicity and quality of life were not reported. Clinicians therefore need to ensure that comprehensive information relating to potential side effects is made available to women undergoing this treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-16 11:16:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ideally, long-term follow up of patients treated in clinical trials should occur to allow identification of any long-term toxicity; including assessment of general health, such as development of vascular disease, in addition to recording cause of death. Assessment of short-term toxicity would be of benefit in assessment of the overall effect of treatment for a group with an excellent prognosis.</P>

Wedges were used to compensate the dose to the breast. The dose in the specification point should be 15.5 according to the International Commission on Radiation Units formulation, according to the protocol (which should be used to correct for departures of dose or overall time). Blocking of the heart was not employed.</P>
<P>The target volume was the remaining breast parenchyma as defined by palpation. The specification of the absorbed dose was according to the International Commission on Radiation Units Report 50.6. The protocol allowed the treatment to be administered either continuously or as a split course treatment.
