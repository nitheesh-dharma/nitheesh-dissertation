[good]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;could Jo check the format of the citations please? Also spell-check table of included studies if possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; please add footnotes to the table to explain the abbreviations used. Also for most studies the Cochrane assessment is D (is there really no data for this?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;DONE [good]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; first comparison title changed to &amp;quot;control appliance&amp;quot; Please specify units for arousals, in first two comparisons. Please change graph scale for saturations and check labels for graphs in Comparison 1. (Active better and Control better?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I HAVE LOOKED AT SATURATION AGAIN - IT IS AN OUTCOME WHERE HIGHER IS BETTER THAN LOWER. THE COMPARISON WITH CONTROL IS FINE AS IT REFLECTS THE DIFFERENCE IN FAVOUR OF OAs. I HAVE SWITCHED THE TREATMENT GROUPS AROUND AND REPORTED +ve VALUES INSTEAD OF -ve VALUES FOR THE WMDs. THIS FITS WITH THE HIGHER/BETTER NATURE OF MIN SAO2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - Fine but could change mandible to lower jaw and patent to open for example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE [good]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - Date of Cochrane Library used for the search needs inserting into methods in abstract and main text. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Could Karen do this? DONE [good]&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, no significant difference was observed on symptom scores (3 trials). Nasal continuous positive pressure was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with oral appliance. &amp;quot; I have altered no difference to no significant difference in abstract results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You say you will use random effects model in the methods section but all the results in Metaview present fixed effects results. This does not tally with the results and needs to be changed please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have altered the sentence about the use of Random modelling to &amp;quot;Random Effects modelling has been compared with Fixed Effects modelling where heterogeneity was observed, in order to determine the impact of variability between studies on the pooled results. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do not put in p values when a confidence interval is shown, and the range in a CI should be separated by to rather than a comma (see style guide). I HAVE CHANGED THE STYLE OF THESE THROUGHOUT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;MINIMUM SATURATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel/First arm crossover studies: &lt;br&gt;Fleetham 2002 reported a statistically significant difference in favour of CPAP (80.60 +/-10.80 in the OA group versus 86.60 +/-5.90 in the CPAP group). In a pooled analysis with first arm data from the Randerath 2002 study, there was a significant effect in favour of CPAP (WMD: -3.85% [96% CI: -6.04, -1.67], p=0.0006).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;THIS DOES NOT MATCH METAVIEW FOR APPLIANCE VERSUS CPAP PLEASE CAN YOU CHECK WHY NOT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWITCHED GROUP LABELS BUT NOT AXES AS ABOVE - THIS HELPS TI CLARIFY THAT HIGHER IS BETTER.&lt;br&gt;**** see below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - Fine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues - I am not aware of any here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked by Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - Back to Toby to tidy and send back to authors please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25/2/03 CJC relook.&lt;br&gt;****** The D ratings still need sorting out please in the table of studies.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I HAVE LOOKED AT SATURATION AGAIN - IT IS AN OUTCOME WHERE HIGHER IS BETTER THAN LOWER. THE COMPARISON WITH CONTROL IS FINE AS IT REFLECTS THE DIFFERENCE IN FAVOUR OF OAs. I HAVE SWITCHED THE TREATMENT GROUPS AROUND AND REPORTED +ve VALUES INSTEAD OF -ve VALUES FOR THE WMDs. THIS FITS WITH THE HIGHER/BETTER NATURE OF MIN SAO2.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;****** Toby please could you change this back again. We must be consistent with putting the OA group data in the first column as this is how the comparison title reads. The labels will need changing around on the graph as a consequence. The minimum saturation is less with OA so the WMD should be negative indicating that OA is less good than CPAP.&lt;br&gt;******* I notice that we have first arm data from some trials and full crossover data as well. When we get 4.2 I would like to see the crossovers pooled using inverse variance. Do we have paired t-test data from these as this may be possible to enter before the next update??? &lt;br&gt;**** I have rewritten the paragraph below from the METHODS to reflect what I think was done in the review.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;included trials were combined using the Review Manager (version 4.1). For continuous variables the results of individual studies were calculated as a Fixed Effect weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). For dichotomous variables, a Fixed Effect Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% CI were calculated for individual studies. For pooled effects, heterogeneity was tested using the Breslow-Day test; p&amp;lt;0.1 was considered to be statistically significant. Where heterogeneity was observed, the results of a Random Effects model were also calculated. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;***** I assume that the Fleetham data in Metaview is different from the data in the text as it is first arm data in Metaview and whole study data in the text?&lt;br&gt;**** I have also the data tables so that ESS comes up as the first outcome in Metaview.&lt;br&gt;**** Exploration of Heterogeneity is interesting in the paragraph below. How different are the oral appliances across these trials and does it matter?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The participants in the Engleman 2002 trial were randomised to one of two OA devices (one with occlusal coverage and one without). Due to the higher mean scores in the OA group, differences in OA design may have had an effect on the overall efficacy reported for the OA group in the trial. Alternatively treatment compliance has not been objectively measured in any of the trials and may have been poor with a subsequent impact on efficacy of the appliances. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toby if you have the papers for these trials I would like to have a look at them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passed back to Toby on 25.2.03&lt;br&gt;CJC and Toby review 25_3_3&lt;br&gt;Crossover studies (combined scores):&lt;br&gt;Mehta 2001 reported a significant difference in Epworth scores which was measured before and after an acclimatisation period and after treatment (10 +/-1.1 versus 3.9 +/-0.6; p&amp;lt;0.01, paired t test). These data were not entered into the analysis as they were measured in a different way to that in Gotsopoulos 2002 (statistically significant effect in favour of active OA versus control at the end of treatment (7 +/1 in the active treatment group versus 9 +/-1 in control group, p&amp;lt;0.0001, two-way analysis of variance) and Johnston 2002 (non-significant difference). Standard deviations were adjusted to reflect the paired t-test results in the published studies. Pooled analysis gave a significant result in favour of active OAs (-1.77 [95%CI: -2.91 to -0.62]). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***** The above text has been changed to reflect the paired t-test results. Not altered for other outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Abstract and Conclusions adjusted to reflect results.&lt;br&gt;Back to Toby for Copy Editing&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;13/6/2003&lt;br&gt;Comments from Peer Reviewer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Severity of sleep apnoea is critical and the review conclusions hold for severe OSA (AHI &amp;gt;30/hr) where CPAP is of clear benefit. Those with milder OSA may not need any treatment. Could you look at the included studies with this in mind and add something to the discussion about this issue. Also did any of the studies look at partner's sleep as an outcome?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;To cut to the chase I don't think the conclusion that &amp;quot;OA should be reserved for patients intolerant of CPAP&amp;quot; is valid for asymptomatic patients or patients with equivocally abnormal sleep studies, but it certainly is for high-level OSA.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &amp;#160; In &amp;quot;Background&amp;quot; it is said (p4, para 3) that &amp;quot;oxygen desaturations&amp;quot; cause sleepiness and cognitive impairment, which I dont think is supported by the evidence.&amp;#160; In &amp;quot;Background&amp;quot; it is said that the evidence linking OSA with hypertension etc is &amp;quot;weak and contradictory&amp;quot;, quoting the Wright systematic review of 1997.&amp;#160; While that was true in 1997 the Sleep Heart Health Study data now available is much more convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you address these two points please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Sleepiness as the primary outcome is problematic.&amp;#160; Patients identify a number of symptoms as impairing QoL in OSA, and sleepiness is only one.&amp;#160; Also, sleepiness is a slippery concept, and many patients deny sleepiness but admit to fatigue or lack of energy and so on.&amp;#160; Using sleepiness scores (rather than overall QoL) may bias the results.&amp;#160; For example, in our trial sleepiness was an exclusion but QoL improved from baseline in many patients.&amp;#160; The ESS is correctly described as validated, but this may be misleading to some readers because that does not mean comapred to a gold-standard of sleepiness (there isn't one), and the ESS is not very well correlated with other measures such as MSLT or overall QoL.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you respond to this as well please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much,&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Back to Toby to send to authors for response please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL pasted 230603:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby and John,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope all went well at the AGM and ATS. As for the peer reviewer's comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take the point about treatment and severity and have added a very few words to the reviewer's conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partner's sleep as an outcome does not sit comfortably anywhere as non of the trials have used it, but I have added the requisite line in the discussion without argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sleep heart health data adds a little epidemiological support to the association of OSA and CVD, though there are lots of caveats and certainly no strong evidence for causation in a mild group of OSA pts. I think we should merely refernce the data and not be drawn into further discussion as it would be inappropriate in an introductory background section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary outcome again! I thought we had agreed to simply list all the outcomes and not assign a primary outcome at all. I would still support AHI personally, but essentially there is no &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; primary outcome until more research is done. Can we have a simple list?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerome&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________ &lt;br&gt;230603. TJL: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it is difficult to pin down the primary outcome for this review - the ESS and AHI outcomes are two important ones, but both seem to be flawed. AHI correlates poorly with subjective improvements, but it classifies 'severeity'. People are also diagnosed on the basis of AHI, trial entry criteria start with AHI, athough ESS does figure in the entry criteria for the later studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESS also seems quite a crude way of measuring symptoms, but it appears to be sensitive to change, even if Les' perception that sleepiness is slippery is true - ESS measures the liklihood of someone falling asleep when doing something other than going to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we try and defend ESS even though both Jerome and John prefered AHI as the primary outcome measure? This was switched at John Wright's behest. Alternatively we could cite ESS and AHI as primary outcomes. &lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Response to Jerome's changes from John Fleetham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Jerome and Toby&lt;br&gt;Apologies for my slow response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)None of the clinical trials we analysed were powered to perform subgroup analyses on different degrees of apnoea severity.We have to base our conclusions based on the inclusion criteria for the clinical trials. I have added this to the text and modified the implications for practice to symptomatic OSAH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) In Background I have modified it to read &amp;quot;Daytime somnolence and an impairment of cognitive function are often present due to sleep fragmentation&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) We should include the following as a reference as it is the international consensus document that deals with OSAH definition and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force Sleep Related Breathing Disorders in Adults. Recommendations for syndrome definition and measurement techniques in clinical research. Sleep 1999;5:667-689. Severity of OSAH has two components:severity of daytime sleepiness and of overnight monitoring.Epworth Sleepiness Score is currently the most widely used assessment of subjective sleepiness and apnoea hypopnoea index is the most widely used assessment of sleep disordered breathing in overnight monitoring.Both measurements have their limitations but should be considered independent outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of OSAH treatment. I have added this to the text in the hope it will be a compromise between Dr Wright and Olson's position&lt;br&gt;Toby I will call you around 2pm Monday to help expedite matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Sign off by CJC&lt;br&gt;I am happy with the changes made in response to the peer reviewer comments and have run spell check and grammar checking so please use this version!&lt;br&gt;This is ready for copy editing and submission please Toby.&lt;br&gt;25 July 2003&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 1st July 2004&lt;br&gt;Toby has included one new study and changed to GIV&lt;br&gt;The What's New section is very helpful.&lt;br&gt;GIV looks fine.&lt;br&gt;The comment on handling heterogeneity has been altered in results (in red).&lt;br&gt;Fine to put on the next module.&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Oral appliances for obstructive sleep apnoea UPDATE&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Oral appliances for obstructive sleep apnoea UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 240604)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-27 15:13:59 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="ORAL-SLP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.2">

<P>Three new trials met the inclusion criteria of the review (Barnes 2004; Blanco 2005; Lam 2003). The inclusion of these data had a small impact on the findings of the review. More evidence has come to light that CPAP is more effective at suppressing apnoea, although the impact on symptoms between the two treatments remains not significantly different. Some data now call in to question whether our previous observation that OAs were preferred to CPAP. It appears that this is not always so, and that there are several important psychological factors which could influence preference over a short-term trial, including perceived benefit.<BR/>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Oral appliances for treating sleepiness, quality of life and markers of sleep disruption in people with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea (OSAH)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>OSAH is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to a variety of symptoms including excessive daytime sleepiness. The current first choice therapy is CPAP that keeps the upper airway patent during sleep. However, this treatment can be difficult for some patients to tolerate and comply with on a long-term basis. OA are now widely used as an alternative to CPAP therapy. They are designed to keep the upper airway open by either advancing the lower jaw forward or by keeping the mouth open during sleep. This review found that OA should not be considered as first choice therapy for OSAH, where symptoms and sleep disruption are severe. There has not been a sufficient amount of research that examines the effects of OA compared with CPAP in terms of symptoms and quality of life. Although CPAP was clearly more effective at reducing the disruption to sleep, some people with OSAH may prefer using them if they are found to be tolerable and more convenient than CPAP. When an active OA was compared with an inactive OA , there were improvements in daytime sleepiness and apnoea/hypopnoea severity. OA may be more effective than corrective upper airway surgery. Further research should consider whether people with more distinctly severe symptoms respond in a similar way to those patients represented in the studies we have included in the review.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-22 09:55:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea (OSAH) is a syndrome characterised by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep that are usually terminated by an arousal. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment for OSAH , but many patients are unable or unwilling to comply with this treatment. Oral appliances (OA) are an alternative treatment for OSAH.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective was to review the effects of OA in the treatment of OSAH in adults.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-22 09:55:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Seventeen studies (831 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All the studies had some shortcomings, such as small sample size, under-reporting of methods and data, and lack of blinding. OA versus control appliances (six studies): OA reduced daytime sleepiness in two crossover trials (ESS score -1.81; 95%CI -2.72 to -0.90), and improved apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) (-10.78 events/hr; 95% CI-15.53 to -6.03 parallel group data - five studies). OA versus CPAP (ten studies): There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms for either parallel or crossover studies, although OAs were less effective than CPAP in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index in parallel and crossover studies. CPAP was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with OA. In two small crossover studies, participants preferred OA therapy to CPAP. OA versus corrective upper airway surgery (one study): Symptoms of daytime sleepiness were initially lower with surgery, but this difference disappeared at 12 months. AHI did not differ significantly initially, but did so after 12 months in favour of OA.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is increasing evidence suggesting that OA improves subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing compared with a control. CPAP appears to be more effective in improving sleep disordered breathing than OA. The difference in symptomatic response between these two treatments is not significant, although it is not possible to exclude an effect in favour of either therapy. Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of OA in relation to CPAP, with regard to symptoms and long-term complications, it would appear to be appropriate to recommend OA therapy to patients with mild symptomatic OSAH, and those patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate CPAP therapy. Future research should recruit patients with more severe symptoms of sleepiness, to establish whether the response to therapy differs between subgroups in terms of quality of life, symptoms and persistence with usage. Long-term data on cardiovascular health are required. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-15 09:56:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obstruction of the upper airway during sleep may result in snoring, and reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of airflow. In adults apnoea is defined as cessation of airflow for greater than 10 seconds. Hypopnoea is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in airflow, often accompanied by hypoxaemia or arousal. The obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea (OSAH) syndrome is defined as a patient suffering five or more apnoeas/hypopnoeas per hour of sleep with daytime symptoms, and is a relatively common condition occurring in 2 to 4% of males and 1 to 2 % of females in middle age (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of OSAH involves factors that relate to the anatomical dimensions of the upper airway, upper airway resistance and upper airway muscle activity during sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Hudgel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudgel 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The patient with OSAH often presents because of symptoms noticed by their bed partner, who will often report that the patient snores loudly followed by an apnoea associated with respiratory effort and terminated by an awakening and resumption of loud snoring. The patient then resumes sleep and the cycle may repeat itself many times during the night. Excessive daytime sleepiness and an impairment of cognitive function are often present due to sleep fragmentation and patients may experience other symptoms including mood disturbance, decreased libido and social withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-ASDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASDA 1995</LINK>). Several epidemiological studies have reported associations between OSAH and health related outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Shahar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahar 2001</LINK>). There is some evidence that OSAH may be linked to sleepiness and road traffic accidents which has medico legal implications, with some countries requiring drivers suffering with OSAH to report this to the appropriate licensing authority (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of OSAH is usually made by polysomnography, which also provides an indication of severity (<LINK REF="REF-ASDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASDA 1995</LINK>). Polysomnography involves recording during sleep of chest and abdominal movements, oxyhaemoglobin saturation, airflow, ECG tracing, sleep state (EEG, EOG and EMG), activity whilst asleep, and arousals. The number of episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea per hour of sleep is calculated from the polysomnogram and is referred to as the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). Severity of OSAH has two components: severity of daytime sleepiness and AHI (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 1999</LINK>). Epworth Sleepiness Score is currently the most widely used assessment of subjective sleepiness and apnoea hypopnoea index is the most widely used assessment of sleep disordered breathing from overnight monitoring. Both measurements have their limitations but should be considered independent outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of OSAH treatment.</P>
<P>Treatment options for OSAH include behavioural modification such as weight loss, alcohol avoidance and alteration of sleeping position (<LINK REF="REF-Shneerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shneerson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>); CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>); and a range of upper airway surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Sundaram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundaram 2005</LINK>). OA that modify the upper airway size are increasingly prescribed to patients with OSAH. Upper airway muscle activity decreases during sleep, leading to increased collapsibility of the pharyngeal tissues, mandibular opening and posterior displacement of the tongue. These changes result in narrowing of the oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal airway (<LINK REF="REF-Hudgel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudgel 1992</LINK>). A variety of OA are available whose primary actions are to advance the mandible or tongue and thus increase the upper airway size. Another, less accepted theory of their mode of action, is that OA cause stretch-induced activation of the pharyngeal motor system, reducing soft tissue laxity and airway collapse (<LINK REF="STD-Ono-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Side-effects have been reported with the use of OA including discomfort in the temporo-mandibular joint, teeth or facial musculature, bite change, excessive salivation or dryness of the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>). The effectiveness of OA in the treatment of patients with OSAH, and their relative efficacy in comparison to the other available modalities of treatment is unclear. Previous reviews of OAs in the treatment of OSAH have only reported evidence from case series reports (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt_x002d_Nowara-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt-Nowara 1995</LINK>), or in comparison to CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>), and their place in guidelines suggests that they are not considered first-line therapy (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life was reported via three component sections of an overall questionnaire - the Minor Symptoms Evaluation-Profile (MSE-P), which has been validated in the assessment of central nervous system related symptoms during cardiovascular pharmacotherapy among hypertensive patients, but not in the assessment of patients with OSA. The three sections reported were: vitality, contentment and sleep. There were improvements in both groups compared with baseline. Vitality improved by 5.4 (95% CI 0.1 to 10.7), P &lt; 0.05 in the OA group compared with 9.7 (95% CI 5.0 to 14.4), P &lt; 0.001 in the surgery group. Sleep improved by 19.5 (95% CI 13.5 to 25.5), P&lt;0.001 in the OA group compared with 22.6 (95% CI 16.9 to 28.3), P &lt; 0.001 in the surgery group. At 12 months, there was a significant difference detected in favour of surgery on the contentment component (33.7 versus 27.4 in appliance and surgery groups respectively, P &lt; 0.05). No differences were detected between the groups on the other two components.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-15 09:43:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>OAs are widely prescribed for the treatment of OSAH both as primary therapy and as an alternative to patients who are unable to tolerate CPAP. There are currently a large number of different OAs available for the treatment of OSAH. Until the mid to late 1990s the majority of studies of the effectiveness of OAs in OSAH were short term, uncontrolled, small and retrospective. More recently the quality of OA clinical research has become more rigorous and this review has identified 17<B> </B>randomised controlled trials involving 831 participants with varied severity of OSAH. Review of these trials suggests that OAs are effective in improving subjective sleepiness and indices of sleep disordered breathing in selected patients with OSAH, are less effective than CPAP in improving indices of sleep disordered breathing but that certain patients prefer them. We remain uncertain as to the equivalence of OA and CPAP in terms of symptoms; the confidence intervals include a potentially meaningful difference in symptoms, but they also include unity. One study measured bed-partner health and sleepiness, another measured loudness of snoring rated by bed partners, and a third study incorporated preference data from bed partners. However, the data are not definitive because of the small patient numbers and inadequate assessment of efficacy with patient-oriented outcomes in the assembled studies.</P>
<P>The issues concerning the effectiveness of OA treatment in OSAH are very similar to those outlined for CPAP therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>). Ethical concerns have been expressed about the use of placebo controls in OSAH randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hans-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hans 1997</LINK>). However, sham nasal CPAP has been successfully used in OSAH randomised controlled trials and has shown a measurable placebo effect (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkinson 1999</LINK>). The best achievable placebo in an OA treatment study would be an OA that had no effect on the vertical mouth opening or mandibular position. However, the inconvenience of this without any likely benefit would tend to bias in favour of an OA which had an effect on the vertical mouth opening and/or mandibular position, unless the benefits could be measured after subtracting the side effects of the treatment.</P>
<P>Compared with control, OAs have been shown to reduce symptoms of sleepiness associated with OSAH, and also to reduce AHI, arousals and minimum saturation. There is some evidence that OAs lead to lower blood pressure from one study. This effect requires replication in future trials. Further assessment of OAs with control should consider quality of life measures.</P>
<P>There is increasing evidence that CPAP is effective in improving daytime sleepiness, quality of life and blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>). This review suggests that OAs are less effective than CPAP in improving indices of sleep disordered breathing, but the evidence on subjective outcomes is less certain. Symptoms and indices of quality of life (arguably more powerful indications of how patients perceive therapeutic benefit than indices of sleep disordered breathing) have shown equivocal or conflicting results. The number of studies, and the somewhat mixed severity of baseline symptoms reported in their respective populations restrict meaningful exploration via subgroup analysis. Further work in more distinct study populations will help to establish whether particular characteristics (such as disease severity and burden) predispose patients to accept one treatment modality over another, to accept them equally well, or to accept neither. If the superiority of CPAP in reducing AHI, arousals and minimum saturation reflects a more intensive, invasive intervention and is independent of improvement in symptoms, then people who start treatment with fewer symptoms do not stand to perceive the same degree of benefit as do those with more pronounced sleepiness. However, if sleep disordered breathing is left inadequately controlled, the long-term risk of cardiovascular morbidity may be significant (<LINK REF="REF-Mooe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooe 2001</LINK>). Studies contributing data on AHI (11) outnumber those contributing data on ESS (seven) or quality of life (five). The use of subjective outcomes is a priority for additional research in this area.</P>
<P>The relative effects outlined above and the different side-effect profiles of these treatments also shed some light on to some of the findings on study withdrawal and preference. It should be noted that there was a higher withdrawal rate in OA treatment groups compared with CPAP. Where this occurs in crossover studies, this alters the characteristic of the study population at the end of treatment, such that trialists collect data from participants who have adhered to both treatment regimens. This is compounded when preference data are sought, because this can only be recorded in participants who have been exposed to all treatments assessed, leaving preference in crossover trials theoretically prone to order effects.</P>
<P>Across the studies there was no consistent preference for one intervention over another, with individual study results indicating discordant directions and degrees of preference for the two treatments. Exploration of these differing effects between trials is difficult, but there have been within-study subgroup analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 2002</LINK> suggested that preference for OA was stronger in those with milder daytime sleepiness, and less impairment in quality of life when compared with those expressing preference for CPAP. Those who preferred CPAP also used it for longer than those who preferred OA. Although baseline AHI did not correlate with preference in <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK> reported that in a mild subgroup of participants with AHI &lt;15, more people expressed a preference for OAs than for CPAP. When studies considered preference in relation to a treatment response rather than baseline characteristic, there appeared to be a strong preference for OAs over CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2002</LINK>). The largest study to date has attempted to record overall preference irrespective of whether treatments were deemed successful or not (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK>). The number of participants preferring CPAP differed depending on whether the trialists asked which option was more convenient or which one was more effective, with many indicating that the placebo was easiest to use. There are clearly complex reasons why some people prefer OAs and others CPAP, and this may be related to baseline psychological factors and disease severity, as well as subsequent response to treatment and tolerance of side-effects. Preference has been measured in numerous OSAH trials where different types of CPAP machines have been compared (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). However, despite a numerically superior preference for auto-CPAP over fixed pressure machines in these studies, this does not seem to lead to superior amounts of usage (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). Whilst preference is a powerful, subjective way of determining which option was regarded as superior in participants in these studies, this reflects only short-term exposure. <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK> also measured self-reported compliance with OA, and this indicated that where the OA were thought to have been effective, they were reportedly used more. Continued acceptance with treatment may be predicted by psychological determinants, and evidence from qualitative sources would be helpful in elucidating the interaction between perceived treatment success, willingness to persist with treatment, and psychological and emotional factors (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Self-reported treatment compliance with OAs was high as reported in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gotsopoulos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gotsopoulos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Randerath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Randerath 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tegelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tegelberg 1999</LINK>), though objective usage data are harder to capture for OAs than for CPAP.</P>
<P>Evidence from one trial comparing OA with a surgical procedure suggests that an OA was more effective than uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in improving indices of sleep disordered breathing. However, the significance of this finding is questionable as there is no definitive evidence of the effectiveness of this type of corrective upper airway surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sundaram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundaram 2005</LINK>). Further work is required to determine the most effective type of OA but until there is definitive evidence of the effectiveness of OA treatment the value of comparing different types of appliance is also debatable. Several studies have compared devices of different design (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luks-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luks 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pitsis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pitsis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2000</LINK> reported no significant difference in efficacy between appliances, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pitsis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pitsis 2002</LINK> suggested that appliance design is important to treatment success and patient preference.</P>
<P>There are some data from a crossover study on blood pressure which indicates a reduction in certain measures when participants are treated with OA. In one measure, OA blood pressure was lower than CPAP. Repeated recording in future studies would help to quantify the effect compared with control. There is a need to monitor other conditions thought to be associated with OSAH. Successful long-term management of this condition is likely to be defined not merely by subjective response and associated adherence, but also by cardiovascular morbidity. Although predictors of treatment success have been proposed they have never been systematically validated (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK>). There are limited data on long-term complications. The results of this review justify well designed, large scale, randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of OA treatment.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-14 17:29:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although the data are limited by the relatively small number of patients studied and methodological weaknesses, such as lack of blinding, there is increasing evidence that OA improves subjective sleepiness and indices of sleep disordered breathing over an inactive control. CPAP and OA both led to improvements in AHI compared with baseline, but the magnitude of improvement favoured CPAP. Symptomatic response varied between the studies, and reinforces the need for additional trials using symptom and quality of life outcomes in the future. Participants were more likely to withdraw from OA therapy than from CPAP, although patients who respond to both treatments appear to prefer the use of an OA over CPAP. There may be various factors which determine which patients are more likely to persist with CPAP and OA, and studies in more distinct patient subgroups, or exploration of patient subgroups within studies, would help to this end. On the basis of evidence in this review it would appear appropriate to offer OA therapy to patients with mild symptomatic OSAH, and those who are unwilling or unable to persist with CPAP therapy. This recommendation is drawn from evidence of limited duration. Long-term effects of these two treatments and their impact on cardiovascular health are not currently evaluable. <U>

<P>Although the evidence base to support the use of CPAP in OSAH is strong, its relative effects compared with OA require further elucidation.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Additional well designed, large scale randomised controlled trials comparing active and control OA are required in patients with OSAH to determine which groups of patients are most likely to benefit from OA treatment, how these patients can be identified, how much benefit can be achieved and with what cost, side effects and complications.</LI>
<LI>These trials should have patient and investigator blinding and perform an intention to treat analysis. Adequate procedures to protect studies against selection bias should be detailed in study reports. </LI>
<LI>Crossover studies should also include tests of carryover and period effects. These trials should also use standardised, validated instruments to measure subjective outcomes.</LI>
<LI>There is a need to clarify the relative effects of OAs and CPAP in terms of symptoms and quality of life. The effect estimate for ESS did not exclude a difference in favour of either intervention, and this outcome in particular would benefit from additional usage of ESS in future trials. These findings would provide valuable insights in to how patients offered either of these therapies respond subjectively, and whether they seek alternative treatments to manage their OSAH.</LI>
<LI>There are very few studies of sufficient duration or size to estimate whether CPAP or OA are effective in improving cardiovascular health such as reducing stroke and heart attacks. Further studies should consider measuring these outcomes.</LI>
