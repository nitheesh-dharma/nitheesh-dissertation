<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-27 15:46:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms (intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-08-19 12:19:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-08-20 10:02:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (which includes CDSR (<I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Heath Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and which includes EMBASE and MEDLINE), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) and Google Scholar for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-15 10:51:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-08-19 11:10:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated, urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of &#8804; 1 year (short term) and &gt; 1 year (long term).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-20 10:04:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Finasteride consistently improved urinary symptom scores more than placebo in trials of &gt; 1 year duration, and significantly lowered the risk of BPH progression (acute urinary retention, risk of surgical intervention, &#8805; 4 point increase in the AUASI/IPSS). In comparison to alpha-blocker monotherapy, finasteride was less effective than either doxazosin or terazosin, but equally effective compared to tamsulosin. Both doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more likely than finasteride to improve peak urine flow and nocturia, versus finasteride. Versus tamsulosin, peak urine flow and QoL improved equally well versus finasteride. However, finasteride was associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention compared to doxazosin, but not to terazosin, while finasteride and doxazosin were no different for risk of acute urinary retention. Two small trials reported no difference in urinary symptom scores between finasteride and tamsulosin. Finasteride + doxazosin and doxazosin monotherapy improved urinary symptoms equally well (&#8805; 4 point improvement).</P>
<P>For finasteride, there was an increased risk of ejaculation disorder, impotence, and lowered libido, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, finasteride had a lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension, and versus terazosin, finasteride had a significant, lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-20 10:57:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Finasteride improves long-term urinary symptoms versus placebo, but is less effective than doxazosin. Long-term combination therapy with alpha blockers (doxazosin, terazosin) improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy. Finasteride + doxazosin improves symptoms equally - and clinically - to doxazosin alone. In comparison to doxazosin, finasteride + doxazosin appears to improve urinary symptoms only in men with medium (25 to &lt; 40 mL) or large prostates (&#8805; 40 mL), but not in men with small prostates (25 mL).</P>
<P>Comparing short to long-term therapy, finasteride does not improve symptoms significantly better than placebo at the short term, but in the long term it does, although the magnitude of differences was very small (from &lt; 1.0 point to 2.2 points). Doxazosin improves symptoms better than finasteride both short and long term, with the magnitude of differences &#8764;2.0 points and 1.0 point, respectively. Finasteride + doxazosin improves scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term, with mean differences &#8764;2.0 points for both time points. Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin improves scores equally for short and long term.</P>
<P>Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, which has higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder. Finasteride significantly reduces asthenia, postural hypotension, and dizziness versus terazosin. Finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride + terazosin.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-10 11:07:22 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-22 15:01:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may be evident in men beginning the third decade of life (<LINK REF="REF-Litwin_x002c_-Saigal-_x0028_editors_x0029_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litwin, Saigal (editors) 2007</LINK>). These symptoms can be both obstructive and irritative, and include voiding at night (nocturia), incomplete emptying, hesitancy, weak stream, and frequent and urgent urination. Around 40% of men in their fifties and 90% in their eighties have histologic evidence of BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1984</LINK>). LUTS secondary to BPH are believed to be caused by bladder irritation or obstruction, which in turn are caused by prostatic enlargement or small muscle contractions within the bladder or prostate. Because most men are evaluated with histologic (i.e., by biopsy) evaluation of their prostate, BPH is often noted as BPO (benign prostatic obstruction) (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-10 11:07:22 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The goal of treatment is to reduce bothersome and irritative urinary symptoms that negatively affect quality of life (QoL). Typically, men are first advised to make lifestyle changes (reduction of alcohol, caffeine) to relieve these symptoms. If still bothered, pharmacologic interventions such as five-alpha reductase inhibitors, including dutasteride and finasteride, and alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (alpha blockers) are often recommended. Five-alpha reductase inhibitors and alpha blockers, which include doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin and terazosin, may be used alone or in combination. An additional treatment option is phytotherapies (e.g., <I>Serenoa repens</I>). In this review we do not address surgical options, such as TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), TUNA (transurethral needle ablation) or TUMT (transurethral microwave thermotherapy). It is known that finasteride and other 5ARIs reduce prostate volume by shrinking it and thus relieving pressure on the urethra. The process by which it accomplishes this is disputed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-10 11:07:01 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The causes of progressive LUTS secondary to BPH are not yet known, although a combination of cellular proliferation and age-related detrusor dysfunction are likely factors (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2007</LINK>). In the hyperplastic prostate, as compared to a healthy one, cell proliferation and cell death have achieved disequilibrium, causing a net increase of cells in the organ. This process is not well understood, but the newest evidence suggests a complex interplay among "[a]ndrogens, estrogens, stromal-epithelial interactions, growth factors, and neurotransmitters[,] &#8230; either singly or in combination, in the etiology of the hyperplastic process" (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-17 11:18:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Pharmacologic therapy is the most common treatment for men with moderate to severe LUTS and related bother. Five-alpha reductase inhibitors are frequently prescribed to improve LUTS and reduce long-term symptom progression, including the risk for acute urinary obstruction and the need for surgical intervention, or both. Determining the effectiveness and harms of finasteride (alone or in combination with other therapies) versus other 5ARI or alpha-blockers provides clinicians, patients, and health policy makers useful healthcare information.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-19 12:19:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>This review analyzed 23 trials and 21,945 men. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 48 months. Ninety-one per cent of the trials (21/23) were described as blinded. Two trials were unequivocally single blinded, with three others probably single blinded. Fourteen trials were described as double blinded, but with no other description. Only two trials described patients and investigators as being blinded. Two placebo-controlled trials did not mention blinding at all. Allocation concealment was adequate in 26% (6/23) and uncertain in 74% (17/23) of included trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Finasteride versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>At endpoints of &lt; 1 year or less, there is little evidence that finasteride improved symptom scores versus placebo, although this may be partially attributable to a progressive, long-term placebo effect (<LINK REF="REF-Rief-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rief 2002</LINK>). Of 4 trials with endpoints from 2 to 4 years, only 1 trial showed finasteride improved scores clinically, although all 4 found finasteride significantly improved scores versus placebo. Finasteride also decreased, at endpoints &gt; 1 year, the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase), as well as acute urinary retention, and the absolute risk of surgery. For men with large prostates (&gt; 40 cc), finasteride significantly improved symptom scores versus men taking finasteride and with small (&#8804; 40 cc) prostates. For men with small (&lt; 25 mL), medium (25 to &lt; 40 mL), and large (&#8805; 40 mL) prostates, finasteride modestly decreased the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase). At 4 years, versus placebo, finasteride significantly lowered risks of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention, or both, for younger men (45 to &lt; 65 years) and older men (&#8805; 65 years); for men taking finasteride, older men had a greater risk of progression then did younger men. Comparing short-term (6 to 12 months) to long-term (&gt; 1 year) therapy, MTOPS reported no difference in median improvements of the AUASI at 1 year, but a median significant difference at 4 years. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride were rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride were at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Finasteride versus doxazosin</HEADING>
<P>The alpha-blocker doxazosin improved symptom scores significantly versus finasteride at 1 and 4-year endpoints. Both doxazosin and finasteride improved scores clinically at both endpoints. At 1 year there was no significant difference in absolute risk of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention. Significantly, at 4 years, finasteride lowered the absolute risk of surgical intervention by 2%, but there was a non-significant absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase). For men with small prostates and taking finasteride, there was a small absolute risk increase of progression. For men in the medium and large groups and taking doxazosin, there was a small absolute risk increase of progression. Drug-related adverse effects were rare; none were greater than 5 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Finasteride had higher rates of erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and abnormal ejaculation, whilst doxazosin had higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Finasteride versus tamsulosin</HEADING>
<P>Two small, 6 month trials reported clinically significant improvements (&#8805; 4 point decrease in the AUASI/IPSS) for both finasteride and tamsulosin, but no difference intercurrently. Drug-related adverse effects were rare and not significantly different.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Finasteride versus terazosin</HEADING>
<P>At 1 year, terazosin significantly improved symptom scores versus finasteride, and was clinically significant as well (&#8805; 4 point decrease in the AUASI/IPSS). There was no significant difference in absolute risk of surgical intervention. Terazosin, for men with small (&#8804; 40 mL), medium (&gt; 40 to &#8804; 50 mL) and large (&gt; 50 mL) prostates, significantly reduced AUA total scores versus finasteride. For men with small prostates, terazosin significantly improved peak urine flows versus finasteride. Finasteride significantly reduced drug-related adverse effects (asthenia, postural hypotension, dizziness) versus terazosin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Finasteride + doxazosin versus finasteride</HEADING>
<P>At 1 year, there was no difference in absolute risk of acute urinary retention and (risk of) surgical intervention. For drug-related adverse effects, men taking combination therapy significantly increased their risk of asthenia, dizziness, and impotence, versus monotherapy, and for men taking finasteride alone, the risk of lowered libido increased versus combination therapy.</P>
<P>At 4 years, combination therapy significantly improved symptom scores versus finasteride alone; improvements in both arms were clinically significant as well (&#8805; 4 point decrease in the AUASI/IPSS). Combination therapy also reduced the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 4%, but the absolute risk of surgery was 0%. For men with prostates of &lt; 25 mL, 25 to &lt; 40 mL, and &#8805; 40 mL, combination therapy significantly improved symptom scores versus finasteride alone. For men with medium and large prostates, combination therapy significantly decreased the risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) versus finasteride. Drug-related effects were rare, with no more than 5.4 (dizziness) per 100 person-years of follow-up. Combination therapy was associated with higher rates of asthenia, decreased libido, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride monotherapy. For men with medium and large prostates, finasteride significantly increased the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 1.18% and 1.90%, respectively.</P>

<P>At 1 year follow-up, combination therapy and doxazosin alone improved scores clinically; the intercurrent comparison was not significant.</P>
<P>At 4 years, both monotherapy and combination therapy improved scores clinically. Combination therapy decreased the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 4%. Doxazosin alone had fewer incidents of acute urinary retention (&#8764;0.5%) than combination therapy (&#8764;2.0%) at a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Doxazosin decreased the absolute risk for surgical intervention by 1%. For men with medium (25 mL to &lt; 40 mL) and large (&#8805; 40 mL) prostates at baseline, combination therapy significantly improved symptom scores, lowered the risk of surgical intervention, and decreased the risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase), versus doxazosin alone. Drug-related adverse effects were greater in the combination arm for asthenia, decreased libido, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus doxazosin alone.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-19 12:19:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>There are sufficient trials comparing finasteride to placebo and doxazosin. What is lacking is a tamsulosin trial with a placebo arm that is sufficiently powered and of at least a year's duration. Also lacking are phytotherapeutic comparators (e.g., Permixon<SUP>®</SUP>, PRO 160/120) with placebo arms. The standard prescribed dose of finasteride is 5 mg. Another dose comparison trial, with a longer follow-up (&gt; 1 year), a placebo arm, and utilizing the IPSS/AUASI, would be helpful in confirming, or denying, Gormley's finding of little or no efficacy for 1 mg finasteride. Another missing comparison is dutasteride.</P>
<P>Current clinical practice of prescribing 5 mg finasteride is validated by the evidence presented here: finasteride is clinically efficacious and has few sexual adverse effects that dissipate past 1 year follow-up.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-27 15:45:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In general, the included trials adequately addressed the PICO criteria (patients, intervention, comparison, outcomes) (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1995</LINK>), which analyzed the constituents of a well-focused, clinical question. The men of the included trials were symptomatic for LUTS and were about 60 years old, an age when about half of men have histologic evidence of BPH. The usual dose of 5 mg of finasteride was used in all but 3 trials. Presumably this was because 1 mg was not thought to be clinically efficacious. The data for this conclusion is inconclusive: two trials compared 1 mg to 5 mg finasteride and placebo (and used validated and non-validated scores, respectively) and found no significant difference to placebo at 1 year; however, there was a persistent placebo effect for both trials. A longer trial with 1 mg would put this to rest. The interventions compared finasteride to placebo, alpha-blockers, and combination therapies (alpha-blockers + finasteride). The only missing comparator was dutasteride, another commonly used 5ARI. Most trials (70%) used validated symptom scores, which was useful for reporting our primary clinical endpoints. These were generally well designed and adequately powered trials, although with the caveat that allocation concealment (70%) and blinding (87%) were not adequately described.</P>

<P>There were three main realms of bias in this review: most of the trials - 75% - were industry funded; although 91% of the trials were blinded, the overwhelming majority did not describe who were blinded (assessors, subjects, providers). A third bias was the use of English-only trials, which sprang from a lack of resources and the deficiencies of the main author.<BR/>

<P>Boyle (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 1996</LINK>) and we agree that, for men with large baseline prostates (&#8805; 60 cc and &#8805; 40 cc, respectively) finasteride significantly improved symptom scores versus placebo. Boyle reported a significant difference in peak urine flows for men with baseline prostates of &#8805; 60 cc and favoring finasteride versus placebo; we found the same, but with baseline subgroups of &#8805; 40 cc and &gt; 50 cc. Byrnes and we also found a significant difference favoring placebo for 'decreased libido', and 'ejaculation disorder'. Roehrborn (<LINK REF="REF-Roehrborn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roehrborn 1998</LINK>) found a positive correlation between symptom scores and peak urine flows (i.e., improved symptom scores correlated with improved urine flows), a finding we confirmed. Edwards found greater improvements for finasteride for symptom scores, peak urine flows, and prostate volume, versus placebo. We found greater improvements - and significant differences - for finasteride versus placebo for urine flows and prostate volume, but no difference for symptom scores. Edwards (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>) wrote "Significantly more sexual dysfunction, impotence, ejaculation disorder and decreased libido occurred with finasteride at 12 months," results which we confirmed as well. In a sensitivity analysis, she found finasteride efficacious regardless of baseline prostate size. Our evidence was mixed. In one trial we found finasteride significantly improved symptom scores versus placebo for men with large prostates (&gt; 40 cc). In another, comparing progression (&#8805; 4 points), and with baseline prostates sizes of &lt; 25 mL, 25 to &lt; 40 mL, and &#8805; 40 mL, we found no significant mean differences between finasteride and placebo. We also found, in 2 trials, a significant difference in symptom scores favoring men taking finasteride and with large prostates (&gt; 50 cc and &#8805; 40 cc, respectively) versus men taking finasteride or placebo and with small (&#8804; 40 cc) prostates. And in another trial, in men with large prostates (&gt; 50 cc), finasteride significantly improved peak urine flows versus placebo.</P>

By conflating the Boyarsky, IPSS/AUASI, and changing the scale (0 to 30), Boyle created a quasi IPSS. The review found improvements of 1.80, 1.64, 2.32, 2.52, 2.55, and 2.82 points, respectively, for each cut point, but only the last (&#8805; 60 cc) was significant and favored finasteride. His findings generally mirror our own: Lepor 1998 (<LINK REF="STD-Lepor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lepor 1996</LINK>) reported improvements in the AUASI of 3.2, 2.1, and 3.6 points for the baseline prostate cut points &#8804; 40 cc, &gt; 40 cc &#8804; 50 cc, and &gt; 50 cc, but none were statistically significant versus placebo. Marberger, on the other hand, found placebo-adjusted, significant mean improvements of 1.4 and &#8764;3.0 points (Boyarsky I), for small (&lt; 40 cc) and large (&#8805; 40 cc) prostates, respectively (P = 0.053).</P>
<P>For peak urine flow Boyle reported changes from baseline of 0.89, 1.32, 1.53, 1.19, 1.39, and 1.84 cc/s (cubic centimetres per second) for baseline prostate sizes &lt; 20 cc, 20 to 29 cc, 30 to 39 cc, 40 to 49 cc, 50 to 59 cc, and &#8805; 60 cc, respectively, but only the last (&#8805; 60 cc) was significant and favored finasteride. We reported, for men with prostates &gt; 50 cc, a significant comparison favoring finasteride as well (Lepor 1998 (<LINK REF="STD-Lepor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lepor 1996</LINK>)). Similarly, the included trial <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1999</LINK> (N = 121), with a 1 year follow-up, found no significant difference between finasteride and placebo for men with prostates &lt; 40 cc (MD 0.7 mL/s, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.0), but a significant difference (MD 1.6 mL/s, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.0) for men with prostates &#8805; 40 cc. And in Lepor 1998 (<LINK REF="STD-Lepor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lepor 1996</LINK>) improvements for finasteride were recorded of 1.4, 0.9, and 2.7 mL/s for baseline prostate sizes of &#8804; 40 cc, &gt; 40 cc &#8804; 50 cc, and &gt; 50 cc, respectively.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-19 12:20:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Finasteride provides moderate relief of symptoms, especially after 1 year follow-up, with few adverse effects that dissipate over time. Finasteride decreases the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) and acute urinary retention, but increases the absolute risk of surgery. For men with large prostates (&gt; 40 cc), finasteride significantly improves symptom scores versus men taking finasteride and with small (&#8804; 40 cc) prostates. At 4 years, versus placebo, finasteride significantly decreases the risks of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention, or both, for younger men (45 to &lt; 65 years) and older men (&#8805; 65 years); for men taking finasteride, older men have a greater risk of progression then do younger men. Comparing short-term (6 to 12 months) to long-term (&gt; 1 year) therapy, there was no difference in median improvements of the AUASI at 1 year, but a median difference of 1.0 point favoring finasteride, at 4 years. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo.</P>
<P>The alpha-blocker doxazosin significantly improves symptom scores versus finasteride at 1 and 4-year endpoints. Both doxazosin and finasteride improves scores clinically at both endpoints. Significantly, at 4 years, finasteride lowers the absolute risk of surgical intervention. For men with small prostates (&lt; 25 mL) and taking finasteride, there is a small absolute risk increase of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase). For men in the medium (25 to &lt; 40 mL) and large (&#8805; 40 mL) groups and taking doxazosin, there is a small absolute risk increase of progression. Drug-related adverse effects are rare, although finasteride has higher rates of erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and abnormal ejaculation, whilst doxazosin had higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia.</P>
<P>Both finasteride and tamsulosin improved IPSS scores equally, as well as clinically. Drug-related adverse effects are rare for both and not significantly different.</P>
<P>Terazosin significantly improves AUA scores versus finasteride, and is clinically significant (&#8805; 4 point decrease in the AUASI/IPSS) as well. Terazosin, for men with small (&#8804; 40 mL), medium (&gt; 40 to &#8804; 50 mL) and large (&gt; 50 mL) prostates, significantly reduces symptom scores versus finasteride. For men with small prostates (&#8804; 40 mL), terazosin significantly improves peak urine flows versus finasteride. Finasteride significantly reduces drug-related adverse effects (asthenia, postural hypotension, dizziness) versus terazosin.</P>
<P>Combination therapy (finasteride + doxazosin) significantly improves symptom scores versus finasteride alone. Combination therapy also reduces the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 4%. For men with prostates of &lt; 25 mL, 25 to &lt; 40 mL, and &#8805; 40 mL, combination therapy significantly improves symptom scores versus finasteride alone. For men with medium and large prostates, combination therapy significantly decreases the risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) versus finasteride. Drug-related effects are rare, although combination therapy is associated with higher rates of asthenia, decreased libido, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride monotherapy. For men with baseline prostates of &lt; 25 mL, 25 to &lt; 40 mL, &#8805; 40 mL, combination therapy significantly improves symptom scores for all groups, versus finasteride alone. For men with medium and large prostates, finasteride significantly increases the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 1.18% and 1.90%, respectively.</P>
<P>Finasteride + doxazosin significantly improve symptom scores versus doxazosin monotherapy. Both monotherapy and combination therapy improve scores clinically as well. Combination therapy decreases the absolute risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase) by 4%. Doxazosin decreases the absolute risk of surgical intervention by 1%. For men with medium (25 mL to &lt; 40 mL) and large (&#8805; 40 mL) prostates at baseline, combination therapy significantly improves symptom scores, lowers the risk of surgical intervention, and decreases the risk of progression (&#8805; 4 point increase), versus doxazosin alone. Drug-related adverse effects are greater in the combination arm for asthenia, decreased libido, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus doxazosin alone.</P>
<P>Finasteride + terazosin significantly improve the AUASI versus finasteride alone. For drug-related effects, finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus combination therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-15 08:52:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Evidence of symptom-score efficacy for finasteride, especially at endpoints &#8804; 1 year, is somewhat equivocal, especially with the persistence of a long-term placebo effect. Stating that, it may be impossible to answer definitively. The comparative effectiveness of finasteride versus alpha blockers is fairly well established, with the exception of long-term, placebo-controlled, tamsulosin and terazosin trials. Also needed is a high quality, comparative effectiveness trial with dutasteride.</P>

<P>This huge and heroic review does not address some crucial questions related to adverse effects (AEs). A recent review from the Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) alerted me to the problem (*).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Nothing is said on how AEs were elicited or ascertained in each trial, or how the trial reports described them. For example, were participants asked specific or open questions at particular time points, and what questions? Or were they merely invited to report a problem when it arose? These approaches will determine the types and number of reports, giving widely differing results. Could the current methods of assessing bias detect this?</LI>
<LI>The review mentions 'serious' AEs. How did the included trial reports use and define 'serious', and how did the review team define it? Were any included patients asked whether they considered an AE serious, or was this the clinician's opinion?</LI>
<LI>Do some AEs wane and disappear when finasteride is stopped, whereas others persist? Sexual function matters greatly to many men &#8211; what should they be told about this?</LI>
</OL>
<P>*ISMP 2012. Finasteride and possibly persistent sexual side effects. Quarterwatch 2012Q2: 7-9.</P>

<P>Thank you, Dr Herxheimer, for your remarks.</P>
<P>We will respond to your comments in order.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The reporting of adverse events in the RCTs was quite varied.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Adverse events were recorded during follow-up for four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lepor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marberger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marberger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tenover-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tenover 1997</LINK>), but it was not always possible to tell if providers elicited the information or if they relied on patients to report them (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 2003</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Wessells-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessells 2003</LINK>, a secondary report of the included trial, <LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1998</LINK>, reported that providers elicited sexual dysfunction information from participants at a screening visit, but relied on spontaneous self-report during the treatment period.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Lepor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lepor 1996</LINK> reported men were interviewed at each visit about adverse effects, but not whether that included a baseline assessment. A better narrative description of AEs could have highlighted the inherent biases of these studies, but a bespoke assessment tool for detecting reporting bias of AEs would have been better.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>We did not, a priori, define 'serious AEs', although it would have been helpful if we had. Instead, we relied on reporting in the trials, which generally were not defined in the trials.</LI>
<LI>Yes, incidents of sexual AEs fluctuate over time (<LINK REF="REF-Stoner-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoner 1992b</LINK>). A new review with expanded scope on the topic of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Garc_x00ed_a_x002d_Perdomo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">García-Perdomo 2015</LINK>), which will replace this review, will include a discussion on this important point.</LI>
