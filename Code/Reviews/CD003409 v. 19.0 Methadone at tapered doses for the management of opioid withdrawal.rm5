<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abuse of opioid drugs and dependence on them causes major health and social issues that include transmission of HIV and hepatitis C with injection, increased crime and costs for health care and law enforcement, family disruption and lost productivity. Addicts, particularly those aged 15 to 34 years, are also at higher risk of death. Managed withdrawal (or detoxification) is used as the first step in treatment. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, chills, muscle pain (myalgia) and weakness, tremor, lethargy and drowsiness, restlessness and irritability, nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea. Persisting sleep disturbances and drug craving can continue for weeks and months after detoxification and often lead to a return to opioid use. The number of addicts who complete detoxification tends to be low, and rates of relapse are high.<BR/>
<BR/>For a tapered dose treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms, illicit opioids are replaced by methadone or another agent using decreasing doses up to 30 days under medical supervision. The review authors searched the medical literature and identified 23 controlled trials involving 2467 adult opioid users in various countries. Trial participants were randomised to receive methadone or another pharmacological treatment. The other treatments were adrenergic agonists such as lofexidine, partial opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, opioid agonists such as LAAM (levo-&#945;-acetyl-methadol) and the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide and buspirone. In the two studies that compared methadone with placebo, withdrawal symptoms were more severe and more people dropped out in the placebo group.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review confirmed that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long-
acting opioids, could reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. The medications used in the included studies were similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted.</P>
<P>The programs varied widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures. Seventeen of the included trials were conducted in inpatient settings.</P>

<P>Twenty-three trials involving 2467 people were included.

These results were confirmed also when we considered the single comparisons: methadone with: adrenergic agonists (11 studies), other opioid agonists (eight studies), anxiolytic (two studies), paiduyangsheng (one study). Comparing methadone with placebo (two studies) more severe withdrawal and more drop-outs were found in the placebo group.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:59:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Recent figures for illicit drug use indicate that the prevalence of opiate abuse among persons from 15 to 64 years old is around 0.5% in most Western countries (EU, USA, Canada and Australia) (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2011</LINK>). Opioid dependence is a worldwide health problem that has enormous economic, personal and public health consequences. There are an estimated 15.6 million illicit opioid users in the world, of whom 11 million use heroin (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2011</LINK>). Opioids are the main drugs of abuse in Asia, Europe and much of Oceania, and it is estimated that globally the consumption of the opioid class of drugs is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Europe heroin is still one of the main illegal substance recorded in indicators of problem drug use (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2011</LINK>). Recent national estimates vary between one and eight cases per 1000 population aged 15&#8211;64 (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2011</LINK>). The average prevalence of problem opioid use in the European Union and Norway, computed from national studies, is estimated to be between 3.6 and 4.4 cases per 1000 population aged 15&#8211;64 (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2011</LINK>). The latest US data, show that, on average, three persons per 100 annual drug users had to undergo treatment for drug use in 2008. Opiates use is far more problematic than the use of other illicit drugs (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2011</LINK>). Australia has an estimated 67,000&#8211;92,000 illicit heroin users (540&#8211;750 per 100,000 population aged 15 to 64) (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Opioids, mainly heroin, were cited as the primary drug for entering treatment by around 216,000 or 51 % of all those reported entering specialist drug treatment in 29 European countries in 2009. The provision of treatment is central to the reduction of the harms to the individual and the community from opioid dependence.</P>
<P>The effect of chronic opioid exposure on opioid receptor levels has not been well-defined in humans. Tolerance develops through multiple mechanisms, including an acute desensitisation of the opioid receptor (which develops within minutes of opioid use and resolves within hours after use), and a long-term desensitisation of the opioid receptor (which persists for several days after removal of opioid agonists). Changes also occur in the number of opioid receptors (Williams 2001), and there is compensatory up-regulation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) producing enzymes. When the opioid is withdrawn, the cAMP cascade becomes overactive, leading to the &#8220;noradrenergic storm&#8221; seen clinically as opioid withdrawal, which may create a drive to reinstate substance use. The intensely dysphoric withdrawal syndrome is characterised by watery eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, restlessness, irritability, tremor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, increased blood pressure, chills, cramps and muscles aches that can last seven days or even longer.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:59:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Treatment of opioid dependence is a set of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing or ceasing opioid use, preventing future harms associated with opioid use, improving quality of life and well-being of the opioid-dependent patient. Opioid withdrawal can be managed by controlling the rate of cessation of opioids and by providing medication that relieves symptoms, or by a combination of the two. Methadone at adequate doses prevents or reverses withdrawal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1992</LINK>), and thus reduces the need to use illegal heroin (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 1990</LINK>). Methadone remains effective for approximately 24 hours, requiring a single daily dose rather than the more frequent administration of three to four times daily that occurs with the shorter-acting heroin (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 1990</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:59:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Methadone can "block" the euphoric effects of heroin, discouraging illicit use and thereby relieving the user of the need or desire to seek heroin (Dole 1969). This allows the opportunity to engage in normative activities, and "rehabilitation" if necessary. Methadone can cause death in overdosage, like other similar medications such as morphine, and for this reason it is a treatment which is dispensed under medical supervision and relatively strict rules. In summary, methadone is a long-acting opioid analgesic with well-understood pharmacological characteristics, which make it suitable for stabilising opioid-dependent patients in a maintenance treatment approach. Methadone was first used to treat heroin dependence as a tapering agent in US facilities after the second world war and had been introduced in the treatment of opioid dependence for maintenance purposes rather than detoxification until the 1960's. Even though now it is often used for detoxification, sometimes this occurs for economical reasons, sometimes for ideological ones. Despite the risk of relapse being high, detoxification with methadone is common in many countries. The upper limit of duration of the tapered methadone withdrawal period appears to be relatively arbitrary; a period of three to four weeks has been recommended and used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1987</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:59:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Different pharmacological agents have been used as detoxification agents to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms, however, the rate of completion of detoxification tends to be low, and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989B" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989B</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valliant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valliant 1988</LINK>). The present review focuses on detoxification from illicit opiate use through the use of tapered methadone.There are no systematic reviews already published on the effectiveness of methadone at tapered doses on completion of detoxification or relapse rate.</P>
<P>The previous version of this review was published in 2005 and an update is required.</P>

<BR/>Pregnant women, newborn infants with neonatal dependence and people with iatrogenic dependence (e.g. through treatment of chronic pain) were excluded. The absence in these patient groups of social and psychological factors that underlie opioid dependence makes for a substantially different approach to clinical management. This was the basis for excluding these groups from this review (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2008</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:00:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Two review authors (Amato, Minozzi) independently extracted data from published sources using a data extraction form. Where differences in data extracted occurred this was resolved through discussion. Study quality was assessed by Silvia Minozzi according to the criteria indicated in <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:00:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The risk of bias assessment  for RCTs and CCTs in this review were performed using the five criteria recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews is a two-part tool, addressing five specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and other issues). The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of "Yes" indicates low risk of bias, "No" indicates high risk of bias, and "Unclear" indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. To make these judgments we used the criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to the addiction field.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) were considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. drop-out, use of substance of abuse measured by urinalysis, participants relapsed at the end of follow-up, participants engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were considered for all outcomes except for the drop-out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. It was assessed separately for results at the end of the study period and for results at follow-up.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Grading of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence was assessed according to a systematic and explicit method (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). In order to indicate the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct, judgments about the quality of evidence are made for each comparison and outcome. These judgments consider study design (RCT, quasi-RCT or observational study), study quality (detailed study design and execution), consistency of results (similarity of estimates of effect across studies), precision of estimates, and directness (the extent to which people, interventions and outcome measures are similar to those of interest). The following definitions in grading the quality of evidence for each outcome are used: High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-12-17 17:38:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>We compared the treatment and control groups for outcomes at post-test and at different follow-up times. Post-intervention data were collected immediately after the intervention ended. For continuous data it was not possible to pool data due to the heterogeneity of reporting in the included studies.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2012-12-17 17:39:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Statisticians often use the terms &#8216;missing at random&#8217;, and &#8216;not missing at random&#8217; to represent different scenarios. Data are said to be &#8216;missing at random&#8217; if the fact that they are missing is unrelated to actual values of the missing data. Data are said to be &#8216;not missing at random&#8217; if the fact that they are missing is related to the actual missing data. In cases where we assumed that data were missing at random, we analysed only the available data. If we assumed that the data were not missing at random, we planned to impute the missing data with replacement values, and to treat these as if they were observed. We planned to do this in different ways and compare the results (e.g. last observation carried forward, imputing an assumed outcome such as assuming all were poor outcomes, imputing the mean, imputing based on predicted values from a regression analysis). For the included studies in this review we did not impute data.</P>

<P>Dichotomous outcomes (completion of treatment, number of participants with negative urinalysis) were analysed calculating the risk ratio (RR) for each trial with the uncertainty in each result being expressed by their confidence intervals (CIs). The RRs from the individual trials were combined through meta-analysis where possible (comparability of intervention between trials) using a random-effects model. The completion of the treatment was reported as the number of patients who completed the detoxification program. The use of primary substance was reported as the number of participants with consecutive negative urinalysis. The results at follow-up were reported as the number of participants abstinent at the follow-up interview (range of follow-up period: one to six months). We used the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test to determine the heterogeneity of the results. A P value of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test less than 0.005 indicated a significant heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, many outcomes could not be summarised because they were presented in graphical form or only provided statistical tests and P values. For most of the continuous variables standard deviation was not provided. Furthermore, the authors used different scales to compare the same or very similar outcomes and this makes it impossible to compare them.<BR/>
<BR/>In particular for the outcomes which we considered as possible confounders such as setting, starting methadone dose, severity of dependence, health status etc. and for others for example, patients' motivation at enrolment, it was not possible to perform statistical analysis because many authors did not report the relevant data and, were these were available, the data were heterogeneously reported.</P>

<P>The diversity of approaches used for rating withdrawal severity, prevented a direct comparison of scores across studies. Different rating instruments were utilised and for many of them, the authors did not indicate the scores considered to represent boundaries of mild, moderate and severe to allow comparison of results between studies. The 21/23 studies that considered this outcome varied in how severity was rated and in the form in which results were reported. In some studies withdrawal was assessed by observers only, in others it was reported by participants and in others by both. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Washton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Washton 1981</LINK>), withdrawal was not systematically assessed and it was unclear how the assessment was undertaken. The diversity of approaches used for rating withdrawal severity prevented a direct comparison of scores across studies, consequently, we have not been able to make a quantitative analysis of the intensity of withdrawal.

<P>Comparing methadone with adrenergic agonists, studies showed no substantial clinical difference between the treatments in terms of completion of treatment, seven studies, 577 participants RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.32). with regard to the withdrawal symptoms and side effects, early withdrawal symptoms were less adequately controlled with lofexidine than methadone; in the methadone groups the symptoms were experienced only in the latter stages of treatment when the dosage of the substance was drastically reduced. Only in two single studies (<LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK>) was methadone more effective than adrenergic agonists in decreasing withdrawal signs and symptoms and causing fewer side effects.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:31:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The extent to which a Cochrane review can draw conclusions about the effects of an intervention depends on whether the data and results from the included studies are valid. However, systematic reviews should evaluate and take into account not only the internal validity (i.e., the extent to which systematic errors or bias are avoided) of each trial included but also the applicability and generalisability or external validity (i.e., whether the results of a trial can be reasonably applied to a definable group of patients in a particular setting in routine practice) (<LINK REF="REF-Dekkers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dekkers 2009</LINK>). The main threat to external validity comes from the clinical setting, and the social and cultural context in which the studies were conducted, and this is particularly true in the field of addiction, where these contexts can actively affect the overall treatment outcome.</P>
<P>In this review, besides the limits in external validity due to the general requirement of RCTs in terms of strict inclusion criteria, highly homogenous study groups, limitations in dose adjustment, etc., the types of participants (adults abusers/dependents on opioids) are quite representative of the general population of opioid dependents. Moreover, the interventions, the settings and the outcomes investigated (completion of treatment, abstinence during the treatment and at follow-up, adverse events) are important to populations, practitioners and decision makers, and relevant for the context of current practice. </P>
<P>However, there are general questions difficult to answer on the basis of our results such as what are the treatment expectations? what defines treatment success? is success strictly limited to suppression of withdrawal symptoms? The studies included did not examine any carried over effects bearing on sustained abstinence or eventual remission of disease and this certanly is a limit. Furthermore onether important limitation to the generalisation of the evidence is the impossibility to cumulate results of very important outcomes such as abstinence at follow-up and control of withdrawal symptoms due the different ways in which these outcomes are rated and reported in the single studies. Finally 17 out of 22 included trials were conducted in an inpatients' setting, which is probably not the most common setting in clinical practice for this type of intervention, and this could act as an effect modifier in the estimation of efficacy of treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:33:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results indicate that tapered methadone and the other substances used in the included studies are effective in the treatment of heroin withdrawal syndrome, although symptoms presented by participants differed according to the drug used. The studies confirm the issue that with the increasing availability of substances that allow slow tapering and temporary substitution of long-acting narcotics, with good medical supervision and ancillary medications for tranquillisation and sleep, withdrawal can be relatively painless. Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is not in itself a treatment for dependence but detoxification remains a required first step for many forms of longer-term treatment. Moreover, different conditions of detoxification can affect at least an immediate outcome: heroin use during treatment and produce different responses in terms of intensity and time course of withdrawal response.<BR/>

<BR/>
Nevertheless, a majority of patients relapsed in heroin use, and relapse from the drug-free state to re-addiction is the main problem in heroin addiction. </P>
<P>Research suggests that for some important outcomes such as withdrawal symptoms, treatment programs are difficult to compare due to the variability of the methods used to assess them. Withdrawal limited to 30 days has the disadvantage that many persons, due to the rapid tapering, are prematurely withdrawn and consequently resume heroin use.<BR/>
<BR/>There has been a general pessimism among both clinicians and researchers about the utility of brief detoxification treatment because many patients soon returned to regular heroin use. This pessimism is probably based on the unrealistic expectation that a brief, inexpensive intervention could dramatically alter the course of a chronic, relapsing disorder such as heroin addiction. Whether people relapse to heroin use again has no bearing on the success or otherwise of a detoxification procedure and the investment in methadone detoxification could be justified if more modest goals were being achieved for example, the reduction, even temporarily, of the daily heroin dosage, with its consequent reduction of dependence on illegal income and the possibility of reaching drug addicts who would otherwise not have applied for treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To enable comparison and pooling of results, standardised criteria for reporting urinalysis results should be used, data should be reported as number of participants with positive or negative samples instead of mean number of positive/negative tests for each group. When different rating instruments are used, researchers should try to utilise only published instruments, indicate the scores to represent boundaries of mild, moderate and severe withdrawal to allow comparison of results between studies and report the standard deviation of the means. </P>
