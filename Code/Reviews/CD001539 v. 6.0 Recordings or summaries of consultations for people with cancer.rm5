<P>Many people find it hard to remember medical consultations. Providing a record of the conversation may help. The review of trials examined the effects of giving people with cancer audio recordings or written summaries of consultations. Most people found them useful as a personal reminder, to inform their families or friends, or to play to their general practitioners. People tended to remember more of the information they were given, and some were more satisfied with the information they received. Recordings or summaries did not make people more anxious or depressed. The recordings had no effects on quality of life, and no studies measured survival. </P>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review examined the effects of providing recordings or summaries of their consultations to people with cancer and their families.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following sources: <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(issue 2 2007); MEDLINE (1966 to 29 May 2007); CINAHL (1982 to 29 May 2007); Dissertation Abstracts (1861 to 29 May 2007; Index to Theses 29 May 2007; EMBASE (1985 to 29 May 2007); PsycINFO (1967 to 29 May 2007); AMED (1985 to 29 May 2007); British Nursing Index (1985 to May 2007); SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI (1986 to 3 June 2007); and Sociological Abstracts (1998 to 29 May 2007). For the initial (1999) publication of this review we also searched the following databases: Sociofile; Cancerlit; IAC Health &amp; Wellness; JICST; Pascal; ERIC; ASSIA; Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts; Mental Health Abstracts; CAB Health; DHSS-Data; MANTIS.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-07 13:08:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effects of providing recordings (for example, audiotapes) or summaries (for example, a letter with reminders of key points) of consultations to people with cancer or their families. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 13:08:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Two authors assessed studies for inclusion. Data were extracted by one author and checked by another author. We assessed study quality on seven criteria. We used a systematic approach to data extraction to produce a descriptive summary of studies, and present a narrative synthesis of the results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 15:36:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included sixteen controlled trials involving 2318 adult participants. The studies measured diverse outcomes. Many of the participants found recordings or summaries of their consultations valuable, with between 60% and 100% of participants (across twelve studies) reading the summary or listening to the recording at least once. The recordings were used to help inform family and friends (range 41.5% to 94.4% of participants in nine studies). Five out of nine studies reported better recall of information for those receiving recordings or summaries. Three out of ten studies found that participants provided with a recording or summary were more satisfied. No studies (out of ten) found any statistically significant difference between groups in terms of anxiety or depression. Three studies evaluated the effects on quality of life, but found no main effects. No study evaluated the intervention's effects on survival.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 09:54:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The provision of recordings or summaries of key consultations may benefit most adults with cancer. Although more research is needed to improve our understanding of these interventions, most patients find them very useful. Practitioners should consider offering people recordings or written summaries of their consultations</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 15:37:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-07 13:16:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Many cancer patients and their families need and want more information than they usually receive in the course of their care (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCA 1996</LINK>). Patients need different types of information at different times and for different purposes, but often feel unable to access information when they need it (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1997</LINK>). Information needs differ between individuals and over time.</P>
<P>Potential barriers to meeting patients' information needs include: limited access to cancer practitioners, a failure by some practitioners to listen and respond to individual patients' concerns, learning difficulties, and cultural or language differences. There are potential problems with all types of consultations in the amount and type of information given by the doctor. Patients do not always understand the (often technical) language used by doctors, and are not always involved in decision making at the level they would like (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 2005</LINK>). Also, people often find it difficult to understand and remember information that they are given during consultations, especially if they are distressed (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Northhouse-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northhouse 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1986</LINK>). This is especially true for those not familiar with the healthcare system or those who do not speak the same language as the healthcare providers (<LINK REF="REF-Kings-Fund-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kings Fund 2006</LINK>). People with learning difficulties are often overlooked by healthcare professionals, who expect the carer to make even the most basic decisions on the person's behalf. The ability of people with learning difficulties to understand and make decisions about healthcare is limited because often they are given very little basic information about health issues (<LINK REF="REF-Keywood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keywood 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One approach to improving the effectiveness of cancer consultations has been to give patients a recording or summary of the conversation to take home and review in their own time (<LINK REF="STD-Butt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Butt 1977</LINK>). People might use recordings or summaries to remind themselves of what was said (<LINK REF="REF-McClement-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClement 1999</LINK>), to hear information missed during the consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1989</LINK>) or to help them discuss the consultation with their family or friends (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>). Recordings or summaries of consultations might help people to identify questions to ask during subsequent consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>), or to seek any further information they may require.</P>
<P>Although the provision of recordings or summaries of consultations by practitioners may be relatively cheap and intuitively appealing, its effects in practice need to be evaluated. The aims of this review were to assess the effects of these interventions and to identify any sub-groups of people who might be more or less likely to benefit from them.</P>
<P>Other approaches to meeting the information needs of patients have been evaluated in Cochrane systematic reviews. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2007</LINK> examines interventions before the consultation for helping people address their information needs, and Johnson et al assessed written and verbal information for patients discharged from acute hospital settings to home (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effects of providing recordings or summaries of consultations to people with cancer and their families, on physical and psychological outcomes, information recall and understanding, participation in subsequent consultations, satisfaction, use and opinions, complaints and litigation, and to identify any differential effects on sub-groups.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the relevance of titles and abstracts retrieved from the database searches. We also checked the bibliographies of identified studies and contacted experts in the field. Two authors independently assessed the full reports of possibly relevant studies for inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the authors. We contacted study authors for clarification where necessary. We included multiple papers from studies if they provided additional data and interpretation.</P>
<P>We used a systematic approach to data extraction to produce a descriptive summary of studies. We present a narrative synthesis of the study findings. We extracted data on the nature and content of the consultations, the type of medium used, the way in which the recording or summary was offered or delivered, and the interventions used in the comparison groups. Outcome data were grouped broadly into three effect types: information recall or understanding; experience of health care (including participation in subsequent consultations, complaints etc.), and health and wellbeing. Data about participants' uses and opinions of their recordings and summaries were also extracted.</P>
<P>We assessed the following aspects of methodological quality for all included studies:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>methods of recruitment of participants and proportion of participants followed up;</LI>
<LI>patients' awareness of the study;</LI>
<LI>method of allocation to groups;</LI>
<LI>concealment of allocation</LI>
<LI>blinding of clinician(s) and of outcome assessor(s);</LI>
<LI>method of analysis (whether or not intention to treat analyses were used);</LI>
<LI>numbers of patients and consultants involved in the studies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This approach allowed the assessment of potential systematic errors, caused by selection bias, response bias, attrition bias and observer bias, the appropriateness of data analysis and the extent to which the study is representative of all people with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We used the Consumers and Communication Review Group's editorial guidelines on statistical methods where appropriate. However, the studies were too heterogeneous to allow meaningful meta-analyses.</P>
<P>For the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1999</LINK>), a review advisory panel was established to ensure the scientific validity and relevance of the review. Members of the panel commented on both the protocol and the draft review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer participation</HEADING>
<P>To ensure that patient views and perspectives were represented in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1999</LINK>), the advisory panel included consumers of cancer care and members of consumer advocacy organisations in the United Kingdom, including Cancer BACUP, The National Cancer Alliance, the Consumers' Advisory Group for Clinical Trials (CAG-CT), and the Standing Advisory Group on Consumer Involvement in the NHS R&amp;D Programme.</P>
<P>An anonymous consumer referee was included by the Consumers and Communication Review Group in the editorial process of the protocol for this review. Consumers' comments on the draft review were gathered in a workshop discussion of the draft at the 2nd World Conference on Breast Cancer Advocacy in March 1999.

One study compared two audiotape formats for the delivery of information relevant to informed consent to participate in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven studies recruited people of both sexes and with various types of cancer attending their first consultation with an oncologist (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). One study recruited newly referred patients with various advanced cancers to a medical oncology outpatient clinic (<LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>). Two studies recruited men with prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>). Three studies recruited male and female patients attending 'bad news' consultations. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>) addressed two different sub-populations of people with various types of cancer, including newly diagnosed patients receiving their diagnosis of cancer ('primary bad news'), and patients with an established diagnosis receiving news that their treatment had thus far been unsuccessful ('secondary bad news'). A second study recruited male and female patients newly diagnosed with oesophageal or gastric cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>). The other 'bad news' study recruited a sample of women with early breast cancer referred to a consultant surgeon (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>). One study recruited men and women with various cancers attending a follow-up consultation with a medical oncologist (<LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>). One study recruited people of both sexes with advanced cancer attending a multidisciplinary pain and symptom clinic. Most of the patients in this study were not being diagnosed and were therefore not receiving 'bad news' (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>). One study recruited breast cancer patients consulting one of two physicians (a surgeon or a medical oncologist) (<LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>). One study recruited females with newly diagnosed breast cancer considering participating in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>). All the studies addressed adults with cancer, although the ages of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK> ranged from 15 years and in <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK> from 16 years. Upper age limits ranged from 71 to 93 years.</P>
<P>The geographical settings of the included studies varied: six were undertaken in Canada, four in Australia, four in the UK, one in the Netherlands, and one in the USA.</P>
<P>Considerable heterogeneity is evident between the studies in the types of interventions and methods of delivery; in patient populations and cancer sites; in timing of initial intervention and follow-up; and in measured outcomes and statistical techniques. The complex design of three interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>) make it impossible to attribute changes in outcomes to specific components, only to the intervention as a whole.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patient awareness of study</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies reported obtaining informed consent from participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>). It is therefore not clear to what extent people in the remaining five studies were aware that they were involved in a study. However, all participants must have been aware of the interventions that they received.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Method of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen of the 16 included studies were described as RCTs; however the method of randomisation was specified in only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK> was a quasi-randomised (sequential) controlled trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Concealment of allocation</HEADING>
<P>Of the fifteen RCTs, concealment of the random allocation sequence until the moment of participant assignment to groups was only clearly done in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of clinician(s) and outcome assessor(s)</HEADING>
<P>The nature of these interventions and methods of assessment make it especially difficult to blind participants, consultants and assessors to the allocation of trial participants to different intervention or control groups over the whole duration of a study. In eight studies it was clear that the consultant was blinded to the participants' group allocation at least until the end of the consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). Three study reports addressed the issue of blinding of assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK> the assessor was blinded, except for the final segment in which the members of the intervention group were asked about the cassette. In <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>, treatment groups were only revealed after the post-consultation measures, so initial assessment was blinded. In most of the other studies participants in the intervention groups were questioned about their use and opinions of letters or tapes, so it appears unlikely that assessors were blind to participants' group allocation.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of analysis</HEADING>
<P>Only four of the studies explicitly adopted an intention-to-treat approach to statistical analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Number of patients and consultants/practitioners involved in the studies</HEADING>
<P>Twelve included studies were single-centre trials; the four other studies took place across various cancer centres in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>). The total number of participants was 2318, and ranged per study from 24 to 670. The participants in all studies were adults with a diagnosis of cancer. They varied, however, in terms of the type of cancer, the length of time since diagnoses and whether they received 'good news' or 'bad news' during their consultations.</P>
<P>All the included studies involved specialist practitioners as the consultants. Five studies involved only one consultant (<LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>), and the same consultant was involved in three of these studies. Five studies involved two consultants (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>).

The other study did not state how many physicians were involved, but there were at least three, because the study was conducted in three different cities (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>In all but two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>), participants in the intervention groups were given a tape and/or written summary of a single consultation. The purpose and timing of the recorded consultations varied. Three studies recorded diagnostic, or primary 'bad news' consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK> also included secondary 'bad news' consultations with patients whose treatment had so far been unsuccessful. Nine studies recorded initial treatment consultations with patients who had been previously told their diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). In one study the consultations were conducted by physicians to summarise a series of consultations with different members of a multidisciplinary team. In the summary consultation, the physicians provided information and answered questions about the patient's status and prognosis, and made recommendations about future management (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>). One study provided cancer patients who were attending a follow up consultation with a written summary of their consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>). In another study, early-stage breast cancer outpatients making local or systemic treatment decisions and consulting with a surgeon or a medical oncologist about treatment were provided with a written record of their consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>). One study recorded the delivery of information relating to informed consent to participate in a clinical trial in breast oncology given in the initial clinical trial consultation and subsequent meetings with the research nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>).</P>

In the <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK> study patients with prostate cancer who received the audiotape by choice recalled the consultation to have been more thorough than did patients who received the audiotape without choice and those patients who did not receive the audiotape.</P>
<P>Two studies reported on the perceptions of being informed for groups either receiving an audiotape, given a choice or not receiving a tape (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>). Patients who received their tape (whether by choice or not) reported having been provided with significantly more information about the side effects of treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>) but had no difference in their perception of having been informed. Patients who received an audiotape in the <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK> study reported having been provided with significantly more information about treatment side effects and treatment alternatives, and felt they had been provided with more information overall compared with patients who did not receive an audiotape.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>) patients who received the audiocassette in addition to the customary written recommendations scored the test on information significantly better than those who did not receive the cassette, but regarding the understanding and recall of the consultation there were no significant differences in the global rating. Participants in a cross-over trial of tapes and written summaries felt that tapes were significantly more effective than letters to remind them of what the consultant had said. However no corresponding difference in actual information recall was found (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study, participants in the control group recalled a greater mean percentage of presented facts than those in the intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>).

<P>Ten studies assessed people's satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>).

One study showed that patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their consultations than patients in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>). One found that participants who received a written summary were more satisfied with the amount of information received than were those in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>). Another study found that participants who received a tape of their consultation were more satisfied with their tape than were those who received a general cancer information tape. They were also more satisfied with the consultation than were those who received the general information tape or no tape (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1993</LINK>). In a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>), there was a trend for higher satisfaction with a written summary compared to control. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>) reported that a tape was a more effective reminder than written information. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>), overall, patients expressed strong support for receiving the audiotape. All patients offered a choice regarding whether they wanted the audiotape decided to receive the tape.</P>
<P>One study found that participants who had received an audiotape of one consultation were more likely to ask questions for clarification in the subsequent consultation than people in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>, across the whole sample there was a correlation at follow up between recall about the extent to which treatment-related concerns were discussed during the consultation, and the degree of satisfaction with the consultation. Patients who recalled extensive discussion were more satisfied. Another study found patients' decisional control to be significantly associated with satisfaction with communication with the oncologist. Patients adopting a collaborative role were more satisfied than those adopting a passive role (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>).</P>

<P>It was consistently reported that most of the patients who received recordings or summaries of their consultations used and valued them. Between 14.3% and 94% of patients in five studies receiving tapes said they had used them as a reminder of what was said during the consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>). Between 41.5% and 94.4% of patients in nine studies used the tape to help inform family and friends (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). A small proportion (1.3% to 9.6%) from three studies reported playing their tape to their general practitioners or consultants (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Listening to the tape was upsetting for between 3.2% and 17.1% of patients from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>). Conversely, 11.1% of patients in one study (<LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>), and 53% of patients in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>) found the tapes reassuring.</P>
<P>Across the twelve studies that provided data on frequency of use (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>) between 60% and 100% of participants who received letters or tapes read or listened to them at least once. Average usage (range) varied from 1.3 (range not stated) to 4.09 (range 1 to 10) times in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogbin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hogbin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK> found that recipients of 'bad news' and patients with poor prognoses read their letter significantly less often than did recipients of 'good news' and patients with good prognoses, but only if they received the letter first. In this study, the emotional impact of the consultation and prognosis did not affect tape usage or letter usage if the letter was received after the tape.</P>
<P>Although a high proportion of responses were in favour of the interventions, the findings about uses and opinions came only from the intervention groups in the trials. They are therefore no stronger than data from uncontrolled studies.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK> examined the impact of the recording process by comparing the standard care control group with the group that were audiotaped but received no tape, and found no difference in any of the outcomes.

<P>Three studies categorised the information given to participants during the consultation as either 'good news' or 'bad news'. Their findings were mixed. One study found that people who received 'bad news' found a summary letter significantly more useful than people who received 'good news' (<LINK REF="STD-Damian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Damian 1991</LINK>). Another study reported that people who were more anxious and considered they had received 'bad news' were less likely to appreciate receiving a reminder of the consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). One study found that, among people who were given consultation tapes, those with poor prognoses had statistically significant increases in their psychiatric morbidity scores at follow-up compared to people with better prognoses (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1995</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 09:46:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>As with many communication interventions, providing recordings or summaries of consultations to people with cancer might have an impact on a variety of processes and outcomes that can be measured and valued in different ways (<LINK REF="REF-Entwistle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Entwistle 1998</LINK>). This impact is likely to vary according to the purpose, timing and frequency of consultation recordings given to patients.</P>
<P>There have been no randomised controlled assessments of the effects of the provision of recordings or summaries of consultations on the survival or physical health status of people with cancer. Most of the studies that have evaluated these interventions have investigated the effects on psychological outcomes. This may reflect the fact that doctors have traditionally assumed that information about health problems and treatments makes people anxious and that anxiety is a bad thing (<LINK REF="REF-Reiser-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiser 1980</LINK>). The studies reviewed here appear to provide reassurance that recordings and summaries of consultations do not promote anxiety except, perhaps, among people with poor prognoses. The results of the included studies also indicate that people may have mixed reactions to recordings: while some may find a measure of reassurance from tapes, others appear to find listening to recordings of consultations upsetting. The effects of the recordings cannot be distinguished from the effects of the consultation itself; however this remains a potential harm of the use of recordings that should be explored in future research.</P>
<P>There is some evidence to tentatively suggest that the provision of consultation recordings or summaries might enhance patients' participation in subsequent consultations and in decisions about their care. It is also plausible that there may be a Hawthorne-type effect associated with the recording of consultations. That is, there might be a positive impact on the content of consultations if practitioners are aware that they are being recorded. However, patients' consultation behaviours might also be affected. In at least nine of the eleven studies where informed consent was obtained, participants in the control groups would become aware that they had not received a recording or summary. This might have affected their responses to the research instruments. These possibilities need further evaluation.</P>
<P>We identified no reports of cancer patients taking the initiative and making their own recordings of consultations with practitioners. It would be interesting to survey practitioners and patients to discover the extent to which this happens and to study practitioners' and patients' behaviour when it occurs. It would also be useful to discover whether practitioners have refused their consent to patients who wish to record their consultations.</P>
<P>The studies reviewed suggest that most people with cancer seem to positively value being given a record of their consultation. In this, they are consistent with evidence from uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ah_x002d_Fat-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ah-Fat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knox-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knox 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClement-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClement 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>We need to consider the generalisability of the findings of the studies reviewed. Most studies were heterogeneous and three had less than forty participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK>). Also, the effectiveness of recordings or summaries of consultations may depend in part on the content of the consultation and the way it was conducted. Future research might usefully investigate the relationship between the content and form of the consultation and the effects of providing a record of it. Given that there are differences in the way that health care is financed between some of these countries, it is possible for example that the implications of findings from studies conducted in the USA, where services must be paid for privately or by insurance, will differ from the implications of findings of studies where services are free at the point of use. Furthermore, there may be differences in the way that health care is delivered across these different geographical locations, as well as differences in cultural practices and beliefs. Given such possible differences between healthcare systems, the findings from studies conducted in one setting may not therefore be generalisable across all settings. None of the included studies was conducted in low income countries. However, given that the provision of recordings or summaries of consultations is a relatively low cost and simple intervention, concerns about problems with generalisability may be reduced.</P>
<P>We could not compare of the relative effects of audio recordings and written summaries. The only study (a cross-over trial) to evaluate the relative impact of tapes and summaries found that participants were significantly more satisfied with the tape than with the letter as a reminder of what the consultant had said (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). However, the same study found that the order in which the interventions were given had no differential effect on information recall between the groups. Further research is required to compare the relative benefits of giving recordings, summaries and other interventions to cancer patients.</P>
<P>Although some of the primary studies state that tape players were available for participants to borrow if required, none report whether participants actually experienced any difficulties in replaying their tapes. Potential difficulties include variations in recording quality, lack of ownership or access to a tape player, and hearing disability. Advances in digital recording may also have an effect on the choice of recording media and access to suitable equipment by patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2000</LINK>) reported that in a few cases (n = 15) patients were excluded from the study because their consultation recording had failed or was incomplete. It is not reported whether any participants who received written summaries had any difficulties reading them due to factors such as language differences, or learning or reading difficulties. The extent to which communication-based interventions such as these raise issues about technical and physical support as well as psychosocial support should be more explicitly recognised.</P>
<P>All but one study recorded one consultation only. Follow-up assessments were completed within eight weeks following the intervention in all studies except for one. These information-giving interventions are very context-specific and arguably remain relevant for a relatively short period of time. At the next consultation, it is likely that different information will be provided and different issues discussed. Further research is needed to study the effects of providing recordings or summaries of a series of consultations. Clinicians who provide recordings or summaries of consultations might need to advise people about how long the information is likely to remain current. There may also be a 'novelty effect' to this intervention in that if people are provided with recordings of each consultation, they might listen to them less.</P>
<P>There is tentative evidence to suggest that the interventions may have different effects on different groups of people. They may, for example, be less beneficial to people with poor prognoses. More research is needed to determine which sub-groups are more or less likely to benefit from this type of intervention in terms of differences in cancer site, severity of disease and prognosis, education, learning ability, language and cultural differences. Meanwhile, decisions about who should be given the interventions should take into account people's medical condition (especially their prognosis), whether they can understand the information, the support they have available, and their expressed preferences for a record of what has been said. If 'bad news' has been delivered, other interventions such as follow-up counselling may be needed in addition to recordings or summaries.</P>
<P>The costs of the interventions also need to be considered. None of the reviewed studies contained economic evaluations, but <LINK REF="STD-North-1992" TYPE="STUDY">North 1992</LINK> reported that the audiotaping of consultations was both cheap and easy and <LINK REF="STD-Sepucha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sepucha 2000</LINK> reported that the intervention did not significantly increase the time in consultations or significantly affect the number of follow-up consultations before treatment. Nonetheless, the widespread use of audio recordings or written summaries would require resources which would not then be available for other healthcare interventions. The evidence of effectiveness of these interventions is presented by a few small trials with short follow-up periods. It would be prudent to invest resources in larger trials of recordings or summaries that measure outcomes over longer periods, since it is possible that the short term benefits of these interventions could be outweighed by long term harms, and vice versa.</P>
<P>Finally, none of the studies reported any problems with complaints or litigation arising from the use of the interventions, although most studies had only short follow-up periods. Two surveys carried out in Australia have suggested that neither doctors nor their defence organisations were concerned about the legal consequences of giving people with cancer recordings or summaries of their consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 1993</LINK>). It is not clear what the opinions of doctors and their defence organisations in other countries would be.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Sixteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Many of the studies were small and considerable heterogeneity is evident between them. Hence, the evidence reported in this review is not very strong and any conclusions must be tentative.</P>
<P>The use of consultation tapes and written summaries is probably helpful for many patients, but not all. Each cancer patient should be assessed carefully in terms of his or her needs, preferences, access to support, and likely responses. The evidence is not yet clear, however, as to which group of patients will most benefit from receiving summaries/recordings.</P>
<P>The studies found that a high proportion of adults with cancer who were attending oncology clinics found consultation tapes or summary letters valuable to remind them of what the consultant had said and for informing others. There is evidence that consultation tapes may improve patient information recall and satisfaction.</P>
<P>There is no evidence that consultation tapes or written summaries affect levels of anxiety or depression in people with cancer. Hence, concern that these interventions might make patients more anxious or depressed should not prevent practitioners from providing tapes or summaries. Nor should such concerns lead practitioners to discourage patients from making their own recordings. However, practitioners should be wary of using these techniques to reinforce 'bad news' when alternative interventions such as counselling may be more appropriate.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that one of the included studies in this review found that recipients of bad news used the summaries less often than those with good news (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1994</LINK>). This highlights the need for clinicians to be sensitive to the context in which information is being provided, and to negotiate with patients regarding their information needs.</P>
<P>As with any healthcare intervention, the patient's prior informed consent should be obtained. To this end, the consultation should be viewed as an opportunity to discuss which types of information would best meet the individual patient's needs. This would help to ensure that the information given is relevant to the individual. Practitioners should be aware that consultation recordings and summary letters may need to be given in the context of a supportive environment, allowing patients and family members to follow-up any additional information needs stimulated by the intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-14 09:50:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Sixteen studies with short follow-up periods met all the inclusion criteria of this review. Although patterns of evidence were found between certain studies, any evidence of effect remains weak and uncertain in the long-term.</P>
<P>Although it is clear that many people with cancer find consultation tapes and letters useful, further research is needed to assess the impact of these interventions on health status. Other outcomes which could usefully be explored include psychosocial adaptation and coping behaviour, and the quality of relationships between patients and their families and healthcare providers. However, it may not be realistic to measure such impacts. For many types of cancer, for example, studies would have to include very large numbers and have very long follow-up periods to hope to measure impacts on health status. If recordings/summaries are useful to people and improve their satisfaction with care and their information recall, perhaps this is sufficient to justify their wide use in cancer care.</P>
<P>In addition to larger, more rigorous trials, more qualitative research would be helpful to explore the ways in which patients use and value these types of intervention, as would research designed to explore differential effects on cancer sub-populations. There is also a lack of evidence about the potential value of recordings and summaries at the later stages of cancer care, such as at the termination of successful treatment, when relapses occur, or when patients are advised that they may have only a short time left to live. Further research may be required to discover how often patients seek to make their own recordings or summaries of consultations, how often they are able to do so, and how they use these recordings. The possible harms of these interventions should also be explored; for example, clinicians may see recordings or summaries as a replacement for spending additional time with people to explain issues or answer questions. </P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Consultation type: The clinic was designed to provide multidisciplinary assessment and management of symptoms to patients and their families during one or two visits. During half a day patients have consultations with specialists in a number of disciplines. After that, the specialists meet in order to discuss the case. Physicians then return to the room in order to provide patients and their accompanying relatives with recommendations and instructions and answers questions regarding the patients' status and prognosis. This second visit by the two staff physicians was utilized for the assessment of the recording method. When the physician returned to the patient's room, in all cases, two tape recorders were activated. One tape was given to one of the research nurses, who did not know whether the other tape had been delivered to the patient or not. The pharmacist delivered the other tape to the patients if they had been allocated to the tape group. Additionally, at the end of the clinic, the nurses provided the patients with a written summary of recommendations by specialists in all disciplines and detailed written information about medications.<BR/>I1 (n = 38): audiocassette in addition to written recommendations.<BR/>I2 (n = 33): no audiocassette in addition to written recommendations.<BR/>N = (baseline) 71<BR/>Theoretical basis: not stated.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Consultation type: initial treatment consultation. Prior to the consultation* all patients were interviewed to introduce them to the idea that decisions would have to be made about treatment and that the investigator was interested in assessing the extent to which they would like to participate in making those decisions. Baseline measurements were taken at this stage. All patients were provided with the same written information package consisting of five brochures containing various types of information about prostate cancer. <BR/>I (n = 30): Men in the intervention group were encouraged to consider what type of information they needed to assist them in deciding which treatment would be best for them. Investigator and patient then examined a list of potential questions to ask the urologist. They also reviewed the information package. Additional questions that arose from the discussion were added to the list, and the final list of questions was given to the participant. Each individual was given a blank audiotape and made responsible for asking the physician to tape their consultation. These men were also encouraged to bring their spouse/significant other(s) to the treatment consultation.<BR/>C (n = 30): Participants and their significant other(s) were given the information package, showed what it contained and told that it might be helpful to read it before or after the initial treatment consultation with their physician. They were not given either support in its use or a consultation tape.<BR/>The follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone. Part Two of the SDQ was completed to evaluate the intervention. The CPS, CES-D, and STAI were sent out to all participants in a self-addressed envelope on the same day as the telephone interview.<BR/>N = (baseline) 60.<BR/>Theoretical basis: Empowerment Model.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Power calculation: not stated.<BR/>*Exact timing unclear. <BR/>The intervention was complex, having four main components (printed materials, question list, support and consultation audiotape). Hence, the significant differences in measured outcomes can only be attributed to the intervention as a whole.<BR/>At pre-test, I patients had significantly higher levels of state anxiety than C patients. This suggests that the groups were not comparable at baseline.<BR/>

The assignments were prepared in 2 sealed envelopes; the first indicated whether the patient was in the control (C) arm or an audiotape treatment (T) group, and the second (tucked within the first envelope) of which listed the patient's assigned treatment arm (T1,T2,T3). <BR/>Clinician blind: Aware of whether control or treatment group, but blind to treatment group assignment (T1, T2 or T3) until after the post-consultation measures were completed.<BR/>Assessor blind: Aware of whether control or treatment group but blind to each patient's treatment group assignment until after the post-consultation measures were completed.<BR/>Patient awareness of study: Two consent forms were utilised to ensure that the patients in the standard care control group were not informed about the audiotape intervention.<BR/>Total number approached: 485. 19 declined.<BR/>Number agreed to participate: 466; 37 did not complete the study; 429 completed the study. 4 of those offered a choice of receiving a tape declined to do so, leaving 425 participants in the analysis. <BR/>Method of analysis: Descriptive statistics; Cronbach's alpha coefficients for psychological measures; linear contrast analyses to assess the difference in mean scores for (i) tape (assigned and chosen) versus no tape (assigned and standard care control), (ii) no tape (assigned) versus standard care control, (iii) tape (assigned) versus tape (chosen); hierarchical regression analysis to examine the predictive relationship between patients' preferred and assumed roles in treatment decision making and 12-week post-consultation outcome for those patients who listened to the consultation audiotape.<BR/>Intention-to-treat: No - analysis conducted on 425 patients; excluded 4 patients who declined to receive the audiotape.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Power calculation: not stated.<BR/>A single oncologist was involved in all consultations. <BR/>A difference in depression was observed between experimental conditions at baseline (t = 1.95; P &lt; .05). The difference between anxiety scores at baseline was nearly significant (t = 1.89; P = .061). This suggests that the samples were not comparable at baseline.<BR/>

<P>Patients' reports of satisfaction with patient-physician communication during the consultation dropped from being extremely high immediately after the consultation to being moderate to high six weeks later. A ceiling effect, however, was evident for the satisfaction scores immediately after the consultation. A ceiling effect also was noticed in the patients' uniformly high scores on their physician's likability and expertise.Overall, patients expressed strong support for receiving the audiotape. All patients offered a choice regarding whether they wanted the audiotape decided to receive the tape. <BR/>
<BR/>For the total sample, there was a statistically significant correlation between recall at follow-up about the extent of the discussion about treatment-related concerns during the consultation and the degree of follow-up reports of satisfaction with the consultation (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.05). Patients who recalled an extensive discussion of treatment information were most highly satisfied with patient-physician communication during the consultation.

<BR/>Patients' decisional role selections were entered as predictors of outcome at 12 weeks post consultation for those patients who listened to the consultation audiotape. Decisional control was significantly associated with follow up mood states and quality of life. With repect to mood state, patients who preferred to share treatment decision-making responsibility with their oncologists had significantly less anger, more vigor, and higher POMS positive score at 12 weeks post consultation than did patients who preferred a more passive role. Patients who indicated that they had assumed an active role during the consultation reported significantly less depression at 12 weeks post consultation than did patients who said they had played a passive role.
