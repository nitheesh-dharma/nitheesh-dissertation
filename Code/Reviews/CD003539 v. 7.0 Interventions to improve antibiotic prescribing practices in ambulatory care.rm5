<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Improving how antibiotics are prescribed by physicians working in the community.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Antibiotics are used to treat infections, such as pneumonia or ear infections, that are caused by bacteria. Over time however, many bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics. This means that even when antibiotics are taken they may fail to cure an infection if a resistant bacteria is present. Bacteria become resistant because antibiotics are used too often and incorrectly. </P>
<P>Research has shown that physicians in the community (in doctors' offices and clinics) can be partly to blame for resistant bacteria. Studies have shown that physicians inappropriately prescribe antibiotics for infections caused by viruses (such as the common cold). They also prescribe antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria when an antibiotic that kills specific bacteria should be prescribed. Physicians may also prescribe the wrong dose for the wrong length of time. Inappropriate prescribing is due to many factors including patients who insist on antibiotics, physicians who do not have enough time to explain why antibiotics are not necessary and therefore simply prescribe them to save time, physicians who do not know when to prescribe antibiotics or how to recognise a serious bacterial infection, or physicians who are overly cautious.</P>
<P>To improve how physicians prescribe antibiotics in the community, methods have been studied. In this review, 39 studies were analysed to determine what works. Using printed materials to educate physicians about prescribing or to give them feedback about how they prescribed did not improve their prescribing or only improved it by a small amount. Meetings to educate physicians improved their prescribing but lectures did not. It was not clear whether personal visits to the physicians by educators worked or not or whether reminders to physicians worked or not . The use of delayed prescriptions decreased use of antibiotics without increasing the risk of serious illness. A delayed prescription means the physician gives a patient a prescription for an antibiotic a few days after the doctor visit; it is thought that if the infection is not serious it will clear up on its own over that time and the patient does not need the antibiotics. The studies also found that using many methods together, such as the ones above, worked better than using one method alone. </P>
<P>Since there are many reasons why physicians in the community prescribe antibiotics inappropriately, one method cannot be recommended. But using many methods to change prescribing may be successful. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The development of resistance to antibiotics by many important human pathogens has been linked to exposure to antibiotics over time. The misuse of antibiotics for viral infections (for which they are of no value) and the excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics in place of narrower spectrum antibiotics have been well-documented throughout the world. Many studies have helped to elucidate the reasons physicians use antibiotics inappropriately.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To systematically review the literature to estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions, alone or in combination, in improving the selection, dose and treatment duration of antibiotics prescribed by healthcare providers in the outpatient setting; and to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) specialized register for studies relating to antibiotic prescribing and ambulatory care. Additional studies were obtained from the bibliographies of retrieved articles, the Scientific Citation Index and personal files. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCT and QRCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of healthcare consumers or healthcare professionals who provide primary care in the outpatient setting. Interventions included any professional intervention, as defined by EPOC, or a patient-based intervention. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-nine studies examined the effect of printed educational materials for physicians, audit and feedback, educational meetings, educational outreach visits, financial and healthcare system changes, physician reminders, patient-based interventions and multi-faceted interventions. These interventions addressed the overuse of antibiotics for viral infections, the choice of antibiotic for bacterial infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis and urinary tract infection, and the duration of use of antibiotics for conditions such as acute otitis media. Use of printed educational materials or audit and feedback alone resulted in no or only small changes in prescribing. The exception was a study documenting a sustained reduction in macrolide use in Finland following the publication of a warning against their use for group A streptococcal infections. Interactive educational meetings appeared to be more effective than didactic lectures. Educational outreach visits and physician reminders produced mixed results. Patient-based interventions, particularly the use of delayed prescriptions for infections for which antibiotics were not immediately indicated effectively reduced antibiotic use by patients and did not result in excess morbidity. Multi-faceted interventions combining physician, patient and public education in a variety of venues and formats were the most successful in reducing antibiotic prescribing for inappropriate indications. Only one of four studies demonstrated a sustained reduction in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with the intervention. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The effectiveness of an intervention on antibiotic prescribing depends to a large degree on the particular prescribing behaviour and the barriers to change in the particular community. No single intervention can be recommended for all behaviours in any setting. Multi-faceted interventions where educational interventions occur on many levels may be successfully applied to communities after addressing local barriers to change. These were the only interventions with effect sizes of sufficient magnitude to potentially reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Future research should focus on which elements of these interventions are the most effective. In addition, patient-based interventions and physician reminders show promise and innovative methods such as these deserve further study. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Many common bacterial pathogens have become resistant to usual antimicrobial therapy leading to escalating use of combinations of powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics. Worldwide, community-acquired infections with drug resistant Salmonellae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are quite prevalent. Given the ease of travel in the global community, these pathogens among others threaten the ability to treat infections, even in areas with relatively effective public health and disease-control programs. Antibiotic resistance in other community-acquired pathogens has also become more frequent in the last years of the twentieth century and threatens our ability to treat common community-acquired infections in both the developing and developed world. </P>
<P>
<I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> is the most common community-acquired pathogen causing invasive infections and otitis media in young children (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2001</LINK>). Antimicrobial resistance, especially penicillin resistance, among isolates of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> has increased throughout the world since the late 1980s and early 1990s and threatens the ability to treat pneumococcal infections. Over the course of eight years the prevalence of invasive penicillin-resistant (intermediate and fully resistant) isolates increased from 2.8% to 6.8% in 10 Canadian pediatric hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Scheifele-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheifele 2000</LINK>). Active surveillance by the US Centers for Disease Control for invasive <I>S. pneumoniae </I>infections revealed an increase in the proportion of penicillin-resistant invasive isolates from 6.7% to 27.5% in eight years across the country, with some regions (Tennessee) reporting 54% of isolates resistant to at least one antibiotic (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2000</LINK>). In Europe, 11% of invasive pneumococcal isolates in the period from 1999 to 2001 were penicillin non-susceptible (<LINK REF="REF-EARSS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARSS 2002</LINK>). However, this was an average and penicillin non-susceptibility rates were as high as 35% in Spain and as low as 1 to 2% in the Netherlands.</P>
<P>Other organisms causing infections in the community are demonstrating clinically significant antibiotic resistance. While less of a problem in North America than in Europe and Japan, macrolide resistant group A streptococci have been isolated with increasing frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Maruyama-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruyama 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seppala-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppala 1992</LINK>). In addition to concerns about increasing resistance in respiratory tract pathogens, researchers have also documented increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant <I>Escherichia coli</I> urinary isolates. Several studies from different regions of the world have documented resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among community urinary isolates varying from 18 to 28% (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ladhani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladhani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhanel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhanel 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>The risk factors associated with colonization or infection with antibiotic-resistant <I>S. pneumoniae</I> at the population level have been well characterized (<LINK REF="REF-Arason-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arason 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Block-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1995</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Nasrin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasrin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nava-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nava 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pallares-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallares 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1993</LINK>). There is evidence that antibiotic exposure is associated with carriage of resistant <I>S. pneumoniae</I> at the level of the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dagan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 1998</LINK>). In a study of the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage during antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Dagan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 1998</LINK>) it was observed that 19 of 120 children had a new pneumococcal isolate colonizing the nasopharynx at three to four days into treatment and in 16 of the 19 this isolate was resistant to the antibiotic the child was taking. The association between antibiotic use and resistance in bacteria has also been demonstrated for many other important community-acquired pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Priest-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priest 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seppala-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppala 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhanel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhanel 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, there is compelling evidence that exposure of the community and the individual to antibiotics enhances the risk of an individual harbouring a resistant organism. For <I>S. pneumoniae</I> carriage, it appears that frequent repeated exposure to antibiotics in children (who are most likely to be carriers of the organism) reduces the pool of circulating strains that are susceptible to antibiotics, allowing resistant strains to multiply and spread easily. </P>
<P>There is a major body of literature documenting the substantial misuse of antibiotics for viral infections and other diseases, such as asthma, for which antibiotics are of no known benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1977</LINK>). Rates of prescribing antibiotics for viral upper respiratory infections in the United States have been reported to be between 40 and 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nyquist-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyquist 1998</LINK>). In England and Scotland, the number of antibiotic prescriptions increased by 45.8% between the years 1980 and 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1996</LINK>). In Canada, one analysis demonstrated that 85% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections in children under the age of 5 years in that province were inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1999</LINK>). In addition to using antibiotics for inappropriate indications, physicians are using more broad-spectrum antimicrobials, considered as second- or third-line agents to treat common infections (<LINK REF="REF-Linder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linder 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One approach to reducing the incidence of infections due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in both the hospital and community settings. Changing physician behaviour requires identifying and addressing barriers to change in practice. In a systematic review of interventions to improve physicians' practice and implement findings of medical research in practice Oxman and colleagues found "no magic bullets" for improving the quality of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1995</LINK>). More recent reviews have confirmed that traditional forms of education such as conferences or printed educational materials produce little or no change in behaviour for a variety of areas of patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2004c</LINK>). More complex interventions such as educational outreach visits or training of local opinion leaders seem to be more effective in producing changes in physician behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2004b</LINK>). Definitive conclusions are difficult to make regarding effectiveness of different types of interventions because the scope of identified practice deficiencies, types of physicians and variations of interventions is too diverse. What has been recommended is methodologically sound evaluations of focused interventions on specific practice areas after the elucidation of the root causes of suboptimal performance and the identification of barriers to change.</P>
<P>Research has enhanced the understanding of the underlying reasons for inappropriate antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infections. Aspects of the physician-patient interaction have been studied extensively and many physicians argue that they prescribe antibiotics for viral infections because they feel pressured to do so by patients or parents (<LINK REF="REF-Bauchner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauchner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1999</LINK>). Physicians who have been in practice for a longer duration of time or are not involved in medical teaching appear to misuse antibiotics more frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinke 2000</LINK>). Physicians who see more patients and, presumably, spend less time with each patient prescribe more antibiotics than those who see fewer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1999</LINK>). In addition, difficulty in distinguishing a benign, self-limited viral infection from a more serious infection requiring antibiotic therapy has been shown to contribute to unnecessary antibiotic use in adults with pharyngitis (<LINK REF="REF-McIsaac-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIsaac 2000</LINK>), sinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2000</LINK>) and bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2000</LINK>). When there is uncertainty in any potentially infectious condition physicians tend to be cautious and prescribe an antibiotic if it could be at all beneficial.</P>
<P>Some of these identified barriers are amenable to change. However, given the multi-factorial nature of the problem it is unlikely that a single approach will work for all physicians in all regions. In addition, different patient populations and conditions may warrant a variety of interventions. This review will explore studies of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing in the ambulatory care setting. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to find trials to enable an estimate of the effectiveness of interventions targeting professionals, when given alone or in combination, in improving antibiotic prescribing by healthcare providers; in the outpatient setting with both adults and children. Prescribing behaviours included: <BR/>(a) the decision to prescribe an antibiotic for a specific condition; <BR/>(b) the type of antibiotic prescribed; <BR/>(c) the dose and duration of antibiotic therapy. </P>
<P>The secondary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the effect of any of the interventions on patient outcomes that were related to antibiotic use, including: <BR/>(a) colonization or infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms<BR/>(b) adverse drug reactions (allergic and non-allergic) and antibiotic associated diarrhoea<BR/>(c) adverse events related to non-use of antibiotics, use of narrower spectrum antibiotics or a reduced duration of antibiotic therapy.<BR/> </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCT/QRCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies were included. Studies examining prescribing of multiple drug classes were included provided that specific data on antibiotic prescribing could be extracted. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies of healthcare consumers, qualified physicians of all ages and level of experience and physician extenders who prescribe antibiotics and provide primary care in community or academic ambulatory settings were included. Studies including only medical trainees were excluded. </P>
<P>A primary care setting was considered one in which the patient was first seen for the problem of interest. A healthcare setting was considered ambulatory care if patients were not admitted to the hospital (including the emergency department) at the time they were assessed. This would include outpatient clinics in hospitals or hospital-affiliated clinics, government-run clinics, private doctors' offices and walk-in clinics. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Professional interventions in the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) scope included the following:</P>
<P>(1) Distribution of educational materials: distribution of published or printed recommendations for clinical care, including clinical practice guidelines, audio-visual materials and electronic publications. The materials may have been delivered personally or through mass mailings. <BR/>(2) Educational meetings: healthcare providers participating in conferences, lectures, workshops or traineeships. <BR/>(3) Local consensus processes: inclusion of participating providers in discussion to ensure that they agree that the chosen clinical problem is important and the approach to managing the problem is appropriate. <BR/>(4) Educational outreach visits: use of a trained person who meets with providers in their practice settings to give information with the intent of changing the providers' practices. The information given may have included feedback on the performance of the provider(s). <BR/>(5) Local opinion leaders: use of providers nominated by their colleagues as 'educationally influential'. The investigators must have explicitly stated that their colleagues identified the opinion leaders. <BR/>(6) Patient-mediated interventions: new clinical information (not previously available) collected directly from patients and given to the provider. <BR/>(7) Audit and feedback: any summary of clinical performance of health care over a specified period of time. The summary may also have included recommendations for clinical action. The information may have been obtained from medical records, computerised databases or observations from patients. <BR/>(8) Reminders: patient or encounter-specific information provided verbally, on paper or on a computer screen, which is designed or intended to prompt a health professional to recall information. This would usually be encountered through their general education, in the medical records or through interactions with peers and so remind them to perform or avoid some action to aid individual patient care. Computer-aided decision support and drug dosage are included. <BR/>(9) Marketing: use of personal interviewing, group discussion (focus groups) or a survey of targeted providers to identify barriers to change and subsequently lead to the design of an intervention that addresses identified barriers. <BR/>(10) Mass media: (i) varied use of communication that reaches great numbers of people, including television, radio, newspapers, posters, leaflets, and booklets, alone or in conjunction with other interventions; (ii) targeted at the population level. <BR/>(11) Financial interventions: methods of physician remuneration, patient-oriented approaches such as user fees and formularies. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure was the rate of appropriate antibiotic prescribing. This included, depending on the specific condition, the decision to prescribe an antibiotic, or not; or the rate of prescribing a recommended choice, dose or duration of use of antibiotic. <BR/>Secondary outcome measures were: <BR/>(a) the incidence of colonization with, or infection due to, antibiotic-resistant organisms and other adverse events associated with antibiotic use; <BR/>(b) the incidence of adverse events associated with reduced use or duration of treatment with antibiotics or use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. <BR/> </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The initial search was carried out using OVID based upon the EPOC search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE. Terms were added to the EPOC search strategies in order to limit retrieved studies to those involving antibiotics in an ambulatory care setting.<BR/> <BR/>MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000) was searched with the following terms:<BR/> <BR/>(exp anti-infective agents/ OR antibiotic$.tw.) AND (ambulatory care/ OR ambulatory care facilities/ OR office visits/ OR outpatient?.tw. OR outpatient clinics, hospital/) <BR/> <BR/>1. exp anti-infective agents/<BR/>2. antibiotic$.tw.<BR/>3. 1 or 2<BR/>4. ambulatory care/ <BR/>5. ambulatory care facilities/ <BR/>6. office visits/ <BR/>7. outpatient?.tw. <BR/>8. or/4-8<BR/>9. 3 and 8<BR/>10. AND EPOC search strategy<BR/> <BR/>These groups of terms were combined using "AND" with the full EPOC search strategy for MEDLINE (see the specialized register in the <LINK REF="REF-EPOC-Module" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC Module</LINK> on The Cochrane Library for a description of the search strategies). </P>
<P>EMBASE (1980 to May 2000) was searched with the following terms: </P>
<P>(exp anti-infective agents/ OR antibiotic$.tw.) AND (ambulatory care/ OR ambulatory adj1 care.tw./ OR outpatient care/ OR outpatient?.tw. OR outpatient department/ OR primary medical care/) </P>
<P>These groups of terms were combined using "AND" with the full EPOC search strategy for MEDLINE (see the specialized register in the EPOC Group Module on The Cochrane Library for a description of the search strategies). <BR/>These two groups of terms were combined with the EPOC search terms which specify the behaviours and interventions of interest and the types of studies. <BR/>The EPOC specialized register was searched for studies relating to antibiotic prescribing and ambulatory care (to the end of 2002). See the specialized register in the Group Module on The Cochrane Library for a description of the search strategies. The strategy was developed using relevant terms from the EPOC classification system and keywords (antibiotic* or antimicrob* or antibacteria* or infect* or sore throat or otitis media or tonsillitis or bronchitis or pneumonia or uti) and (behaviour=prescribing). Additional studies were sought from the bibliographies of retrieved articles and personal files. There were no language limitations.<BR/> </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Citations and abstracts retrieved in the search were reviewed for potential inclusion by the primary author. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed by both authors according to the criteria described by the EPOC group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-Resources" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC Resources</LINK>). Assessments for inclusion were done independently by two review authors without blinding to study author or location. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. </P>
<P>Data abstraction was performed by the two review authors using a template from the EPOC Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-Resources" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC Resources</LINK>) including information on: study design, type of intervention, presence of controls, type of targeted behaviour, participants, setting, methods (unit of allocation, unit of analysis, study power, methodological quality, consumer involvement), outcomes and results. </P>
<P>Data from RCTs and CBAs was presented using the format suggested by EPOC (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-Resources" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC Resources</LINK>). Data was reported in natural units in the results table. Where baseline results were available from RCT/QRCTs and CBAs, pre-intervention and postintervention means or proportions were reported for both study and control groups and the difference in absolute change from baseline was calculated (change in study group values minus change in control group values) along with 95% confidence intervals or P values, if available. When baseline data were not available, results were expressed as the relative percentage change (the difference between postintervention values in the study and control groups expressed as a percentage of postintervention values in the control group). Where trials compared more than one intervention or a combination of interventions, comparisons of each intervention to the control group were handled separately. When several outcomes were reported in one trial we extracted results only for the primary outcome. If a primary outcome was not specified, we calculated the mean effect size for the multiple outcomes reported in the trial.</P>
<P>It has been found that many ITS studies do not include an appropriate analysis of time-series data (<LINK REF="REF-Grilli-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 1997</LINK>). For ITS studies, re-analysis of the data was undertaken, where the original paper did not include such an analysis, using the recommended EPOC methods (WEBSITE). </P>
<P>The retrieved studies were very heterogenous with respect to the reported outcomes (for example reducing duration of therapy, increasing use of first-line agents or reducing use of antibiotics for a particular condition) and the units of measure (for example absolute number of prescriptions, number of prescriptions per unit of population, defined daily doses, proportion of patients receiving a prescription). This made quantitative analysis difficult. Thus, studies were reviewed qualitatively. In addition, unit of analysis errors were reported when present but reanalysis of the data in studies with these errors was not undertaken as there would be no quantitative analysis. These errors were noted in the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P> One hundred and eighteen references were retrieved from a search of the EPOC specialized register through to the end of 2002. In addition, 33 articles were retrieved from both personal files and a review of bibliographies of retrieved articles and systematic reviews, giving a total of 151 articles. Three studies were excluded as they were duplicates of studies published in another language. Two additional papers were long-term follow-up publications from earlier studies. These were considered as single studies along with the original publication. Fifty-one studies were excluded prior to full review, based on the title and abstract, as they were not intervention studies, not studies of medical healthcare workers, were hospital-based studies or systematic reviews. Fifty-two further studies were excluded after more detailed review on the basis of failure to meet minimum methodological criteria set out by the EPOC Group (see the Characteristics of Excluded Studies table) or antibiotic data could not be extracted or obtained from authors (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ornstein-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ornstein 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Studies from eight of the 11 categories of interventions were reviewed. Several studies included more than one intervention and, thus, were discussed in two different comparisons. The comparisons examined in this review were as follows. <BR/>Comparison 1: printed educational materials compared to another intervention or controls (four studies). <BR/>Comparison 2: audit and feedback (with or without printed educational materials) compared to another intervention or controls (four studies). <BR/>Comparison 3: group educational meetings (with or without audit and feedback and printed educational materials) compared to another intervention or controls (ten studies). <BR/>Comparison 4: educational outreach visits (academic detailing) compared to another intervention or controls (eight studies). <BR/>Comparison 5: financial or healthcare delivery changes compared to another intervention or controls (two studies). <BR/>Comparison 6: physician reminders compared to another intervention or controls (three studies). <BR/>Comparison 7: patient-based interventions compared to another intervention or controls (five studies). <BR/>Comparison 8: multi-faceted interventions (combinations of multiple interventions to physicians, patients and the general public) compared to another intervention or controls (seven studies). </P>
<P>The interventions targeted a variety of prescribing behaviours. There were 13 studies aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing for particular conditions: diarrhoea (two); and respiratory tract infections including non-specific viral upper respiratory infections (URI), sore throat, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute otitis media and acute bronchitis (11). In nine studies the target of the intervention was to reduce oral (or intramuscular in one study) antibiotic use for any condition. Authors of five studies sought to reduce the use of particular antibiotics considered to be contraindicated for routine use, such as tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, cephalexin (three studies); or to be overused (macrolides for group A streptococcal infections, ciprofloxacin) (two studies). There were studies where the goal was to increase use of recommended first-line antibiotics (and reduce use of second- or third-line agents) for a variety of conditions (eight studies: urinary tract infection, acute otitis media, tonsillitis); and to reduce the duration of prescribed therapy for certain conditions (five studies: urinary tract infection, acute otitis media). There were two studies examining the effect of reducing antibiotic use on patient illness resolution and four examining the effect on antibiotic-resistant bacteria in study communities. The largest number of studies came from the United States or Canada (16). The remaining studies came from Great Britain (five), Australia and New Zealand (five), Norway (three), Spain (two), and one study each from Sri Lanka, Zambia, Sweden, South Africa, Mexico, Indonesia, Finland and the Netherlands. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological characteristics of the studies are in the Characteristics of Included Studies table. There were 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one quasi-randomised control trial (QRCT), 11 controlled before and after studies (CBA) and two interrupted time series (ITS) studies. Most of these studies had methodological limitations as assessed by the quality criteria of the EPOC study group. Five of the 20 RCT/QRCTs and one of 11 CBA studies that included providers or groups of providers as the unit of allocation completed appropriate statistical analyses. The remaining six studies were either randomised at the patient level (five studies) or at the physician level, with only one patient per physician analysed (one study). Five RCTs reported methods of randomisation resulting in adequate concealment of allocation to the study groups. Sample size or power calculations were reported in 13 RCTs and no CBA studies. Only four CBA studies reported baseline measurements that were similar between intervention and control groups. </P>
<P>The two ITS studies also had significant methodological issues. In neither study was it stated that the intervention occurred independently of other changes that might affect prescribing of the particular antibiotic. In addition, neither study undertook appropriate statistical analysis for time series data. The data was re-analysed using time-series regression techniques. The original results and the results from the time-series regression analysis were reported. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 1: printed educational materials versus other intervention or controls</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. There were four studies in which physicians received unsolicited, printed educational materials regarding appropriate antibiotic prescribing either by mail (<LINK REF="STD-Angunawela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angunawela 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Avorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffner 1983</LINK>) or by publication in a national medical journal (<LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>). No materials referring to the specific physician's practice (that it is an audit of prescribing practices with feedback) were used in these studies. None of the studies using mailed materials demonstrated a statistically significant change in prescribing behaviour despite unit of analysis errors. The ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>) demonstrated a significant reduction in macrolide antibiotic use across Finland following publication of a recommendation to avoid macrolides as first-line agents for group A streptococcal throat and soft tissue infections. The pre- to postintervention change reported in the study was -1.02 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants (P value 0.007). By time-series regression analysis (not performed by study authors) there was a change of -1.59 DDD per 1000 inhabitants following the intervention. Pre-intervention, the slope of the curve of macrolide prescribing over time was 0.12 DDD per year, a significant increase in the yearly rate of macrolide prescribing. As there was no significant change in the slope of the prescribing curve following the intervention, this indicates that the intervention effect was maintained over the period of time studied post intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 2: audit and feedback with or without other educational materials versus other intervention or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. In the studies of audit and feedback additional materials distributed along with the feedback material included any one or more of the following: an explanation of the prescribing data, anonymous comparative data for other physicians or groups of physicians, or educational materials promoting more optimal prescribing practices. Interventions using audit and feedback as a component of educational meetings or academic detailing were discussed in comparisons 3 and 4 respectively.</P>
<P>There were four studies in this comparison, three randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mainous-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mainous 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 1999</LINK>) and one controlled before and after trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rokstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rokstad 1995</LINK>), all of which had unit of analysis errors. Two studies failed to demonstrate a significant change in prescribing indicators of overall antibiotic use in rural Australia (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 1999</LINK>) or use of first-line antibiotics for UTI in Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Rokstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rokstad 1995</LINK>). In the latter study, however, there was a reduction in the duration of therapy for intervention group compared with controls (-7.7 DDD). In a study from Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Hux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hux 1999</LINK>) there was an absolute increase in prescribing of first-line antibiotics from baseline compared to controls, of 5.1% (P value &lt;0.01), with a median cost saving of $3.32 per physician (P value &lt;0.002). In a US study (<LINK REF="STD-Mainous-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mainous 2000</LINK>) comparing audit and feedback, patient educational materials or a combination of the two to controls, the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics for colds increased in all study groups after the intervention. However, this increase was significantly lower for audit and feedback plus patient educational materials (-7.3%) compared to controls.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 3: educational meetings versus other interventions or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Educational meetings included one or more of the following: audiovisual review of recommendations for appropriate prescribing practices for particular conditions or particular antibiotics, review of a clinical practice guideline or other published recommendations, a combination of the two, and provision of audit and feedback. It excluded educational outreach visits (academic detailing: see comparison 4), which are one-on-one meetings between the prescribing physician and another individual (physician, pharmacist or drug detailer).</P>
<P>There were seven RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Angunawela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angunawela 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagerlov-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerlov 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundborg-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lundborg 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veninga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veninga 2000</LINK>), one quasi-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1984</LINK>) and two CBA studies (<LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Cuevas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Cuevas 1996</LINK>) reviewed in this section. Three RCTs, from Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Lundborg-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lundborg 1999a</LINK>), the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Veninga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veninga 2000</LINK>) and Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Lagerlov-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerlov 2000</LINK>) used group educational meetings with audit and feedback to promote prescribing of first-line antibiotics for urinary tract infection. Controls in these studies received a similar intervention targeting asthma management. All three studies were without unit of analysis errors. The change in the proportion of patients prescribed a first-line antibiotic compared to controls ranged from 1.0% (<LINK REF="STD-Veninga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veninga 2000</LINK>) to 17% (P value &lt;0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Lundborg-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lundborg 1999a</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lagerlov-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerlov 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veninga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veninga 2000</LINK>) were able to demonstrate changes in the duration of therapy with antibiotics for UTI. In <LINK REF="STD-Lagerlov-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerlov 2000</LINK> a relative increase of 13.1% of patients received short-course therapy, P value &lt;0.0001; and in <LINK REF="STD-Veninga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veninga 2000</LINK> there was a change in defined daily doses of antibiotics of -1.89 (P value 0.05).</P>
<P>Four RCTs examined the effect of educational meetings on reducing overall antibiotic use in the developing countries South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>), Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>), Sri Lanka (<LINK REF="STD-Angunawela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angunawela 1991</LINK>) and Indonesia (<LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>). All of these studies had unit of analysis errors. The content of the interventions in the first three studies was based on rational prescribing guidelines produced by the World Health Organization, focusing on reducing antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infection and acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vries-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vries 1994</LINK>). Similarly a study from Indonesia (<LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>), in which health centres were randomised to small or large group educational meetings or no intervention, aimed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for acute diarrhoea. The changes in the proportion of patients receiving an antibiotic compared with controls in these studies were -21.6% (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>), -8.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>), -6.9% (<LINK REF="STD-Angunawela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angunawela 1991</LINK>) and -6.7% for formal large group seminars and -13.7% for small, interactive discussion groups (<LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies from Great Britain, one using multiple small group meetings compared to controls (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1984</LINK>) and one using small group interactive prescribing workshops compared to large, formal microbiology tutorials (<LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2000</LINK>) demonstrated no significant reduction in the overall use of antibiotics. Modest reductions in the proportion of patients with viral URI who were prescribed an antibiotic were seen following group meetings targeting this behaviour in Mexico (-7.4% in one clinic type, -32.9% in the second clinic type) (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Cuevas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Cuevas 1996</LINK>). All of these studies had unit of analysis errors.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 4: educational outreach visits versus other intervention or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. The eight studies in this section use similar methods of educational outreach to those used by pharmaceutical representatives (<LINK REF="STD-Avorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Avorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolovich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dolovich 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffner 1983</LINK>). All eight studies had unit of analysis errors. The detailers in these studies were clinical or research pharmacists except for the study by Schaffner (<LINK REF="STD-Schaffner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffner 1983</LINK>) where they compared the effectiveness of physician and pharmacist detailers. Four studies, three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Avorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Avorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Font--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Font 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1982</LINK>) and one CBA (<LINK REF="STD-Schaffner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffner 1983</LINK>), examined the effect of academic detailing on prescribing of certain antibiotics considered contraindicated or overused by community physicians. McConnell et al (<LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1982</LINK>) in the US were able to reduce the mean number of prescriptions for tetracycline (-6.4 prescriptions, P value &lt;0.05). Avorn and Soumerai were able to reduce the mean number of units of cephalexin prescribed in four US regions (-382, P value 0.0006) using pharmacist detailers and printed educational materials. In Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Font--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Font 1991</LINK>), pharmacist detailers were unable to significantly reduce the prescribing of various oral and injectable antibiotics after three meetings (mean of several antibiotics: -1.31 containers per doctor per month). In the Schaffner study (<LINK REF="STD-Schaffner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffner 1983</LINK>) the mean change in prescribing (combining data for contraindicated antibiotics and oral cephalosporins) was not improved by physician detailing (change in number of prescriptions per physician compared to controls: 13.0) but was somewhat improved by pharmacist detailers (change in number of prescriptions per physician compared to controls: -10.4). Follow up of physicians one year later (<LINK REF="STD-Ray-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 1985</LINK>) indicated that these changes were maintained in the second year after the intervention (physician detailers compared to controls: 6.5; pharmacist detailers compared to controls: -9.0).</P>
<P>Three studies from Australia examined the effect of academic detailing on increasing the prescribing of first-line antibiotics: two were RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-De-Santis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">De Santis 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilett-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ilett 2000</LINK>) and one a CBA (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1997</LINK>). Peterson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1997</LINK>) were able to increase the proportion of defined daily doses for first-line antibiotics for UTI by 9.5% compared to controls (P value &lt;0.0001). Using a similar procedure, Ilett (<LINK REF="STD-Ilett-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ilett 2000</LINK>) increased the number of prescriptions for first-line antibiotics for respiratory tract infection and UTI by 152.6 compared to controls. DeSantis (<LINK REF="STD-De-Santis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">De Santis 1984</LINK>) was, however, unable to demonstrate an improvement in the prescribing of first-line antibiotics for tonsillitis (-3.3% for the median proportion of prescriptions for first-line agents).</P>
<P>The other RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Dolovich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dolovich 1999</LINK>) used pharmaceutical industry detailers in an attempt to increase prescribing of amoxicillin for acute otitis media in Canada. The market share of amoxicillin increased by 1.35% in the intervention regions compared with control regions receiving routine detailing; however, after adjusting for various factors this was not a statistically significant change.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 5: financial and healthcare system changes versus other intervention or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Researchers in Nova Scotia, Canada, studied the effect of a change in the provincial drug formulary limiting the use of fluoroquinolones (FQ) to certain specific conditions in the elderly (<LINK REF="STD-MacCara-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacCara 2001</LINK>), using time-series methods. They reported the absolute change in the average monthly number of FQ prescriptions between the month immediately prior to and the month immediately following the formulary change to be -1441.5 prescriptions. Reanalysis of the data using time-series regression analysis detected the same significant drop in the level of prescribing between pre- and post-formulary changes (-1532.34, P value &lt;0.001). Neither the pre- nor postintervention slopes for the rate of change in monthly FQ prescribing were statistically significant (pre-intervention slope 3.95 prescriptions per month, p=0.29; post-slope 10.74 prescriptions per month, P value 0.33), there was a trend toward an increased postintervention slope, which may indicate a decay in the intervention effect over time. The total number of antibiotic prescriptions to seniors in this time period did not change, with a compensatory increase in the prescribing of macrolide antibiotics.</P>
<P>In a controlled before and after study from Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Juncosa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Juncosa 1997</LINK>), researchers examined the effect of primary care reform on antibiotic prescribing in one county, using regions that had not yet undergone reform as the controls. The primary care reform consisted, mainly, of changes in staffing, reimbursement and the organization of services. They demonstrated a change in the reform regions compared with controls of -454 monthly packages of antibiotics. This study suffered from unit of analysis errors.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 6: reminders versus other intervention or controls</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. Physician reminders at the point of care have been assessed in three RCTs attempting to reduce antibiotic prescribing for two clinical syndromes, acute otitis media (<LINK REF="STD-Christakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christakis 2001</LINK>) and sore throat (<LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 2002</LINK>). In the otitis study (<LINK REF="STD-Christakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christakis 2001</LINK>), an online prescription writer at a primary care pediatric clinic in Seattle, Washington, was used to present computer-based point-of-care evidence on the optimal duration of antibiotics for acute otitis media in children. Postintervention, there was a 44.43% relative increase in proportion of short course prescriptions in the intervention group compared with 10.48% in the control group (P value &lt; 0.01). No adjustments for clustering of patients with physicians were made.</P>
<P>In two studies, researchers in Ontario, Canada, examined the effects of a paper-based decision support tool for diagnosis and management of sore throat. The tool consisted of a scoring system to help determine the likelihood that a patient was suffering from streptococcal pharyngitis utilizing common signs and symptoms followed by management recommendations. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 1998</LINK>) compared the provision of a score card and a patient-encounter form to a patient-encounter form that required the physician to calculate a sore throat score. Since each physician contributed only one sore throat encounter there was no unit of analysis error. In a multiple logistic regression model (controlling for patient characteristics) the odds ratio for prescribing in the intervention group compared with controls was 0.44 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.92). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 2002</LINK>) was designed to determine if repeated prompts to use the same checklist and score would reduce prescribing for sore throat further. All physicians received a pocket card summarizing the score, eight patient encounter and consent forms and a one-page survey of practice characteristics. Physicians in the intervention group received stickers to place on the patient encounter forms with the score items and a place to calculate the score (as repeated prompts to use the score). The absolute difference in the proportion of patient receiving antibiotics in the intervention compared with the control groups was -0.2%; and there was no reduction in the odds of prescribing associated with the intervention (odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.17).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 7: patient-based interventions versus other intervention or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>. There were five studies examining the effects of a variety of patient-based interventions alone. These studies evaluated the effect of patient educational materials with or without physician audit and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Mainous-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mainous 2000</LINK>), a patient information leaflet regarding antibiotics for acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Macfarlane-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Macfarlane 2002</LINK>) and the use of delayed prescriptions for infections where patients desired antibiotics but physicians did not feel antibiotics were necessary (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>). These studies were all RCTs with patients as the unit of randomization for the last three studies.</P>
<P>In the study by Mainous (<LINK REF="STD-Mainous-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mainous 2000</LINK>), despite an increase in prescribing across all study groups, the proportions of children receiving antibiotics for viral URI in the groups receiving patient educational materials (with or without audit and feedback) were reduced significantly compared with controls (-9.9% for patient materials alone; -7.2% for patient materials plus physician audit and feedback); although there was unit of analysis error in this study. Macfarlane (<LINK REF="STD-Macfarlane-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Macfarlane 2002</LINK>) randomised patients who were thought to desire but not need antibiotics, as assessed by the physician, to receive either a leaflet explaining why antibiotics were unnecessary or a blank leaflet. This intervention resulted in an absolute difference in the proportion of patients taking antibiotics of -15.2%.</P>
<P>Three additional studies utilizing a similar concept for the common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>) or acute otitis media (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>) randomised patients to receive and fill a prescription immediately or to delay filling the perscription for three to seven days. In all three studies, patients in the delayed arm were significantly less likely to obtain their antibiotic prescriptions. The absolute differences in the proportion of patients obtaining prescription between intervention and control groups were -45% (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>), -55% (<LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>) and -74.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 8: multi-faceted interventions versus other intervention or control</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>. Seven of the most recent studies in this review have capitalized on the modest success of the previously-described interventions and have created complex, multi-faceted interventions to reduce antibiotic misuse (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flottorp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Flottorp 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzales 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2000</LINK>). These interventions generally employed physician education in a variety of forums as well as education of the patient or parent and the general public on the appropriate use of antibiotics. The public education message in these studies has focused on the individual and public health hazards of antibiotic overuse. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was involved in the design and implementation of four out of the seven studies in this category (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>). Three were CBAs (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>) and one an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 2001</LINK>). Three of the studies did not have unit of analysis errors(<LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flottorp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Flottorp 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzales 1999</LINK>). Three studies examined the effect of multi-faceted interventions on the rate of penicillin-resistant <I>S. pneumoniae</I> infections (<LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>) or colonization (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>) reviewed in comparison 9.</P>
<P>In the four CDC-sponsored studies, the interventions involved a combination of healthcare provider and consumer education aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infections. Health-care provider education was undertaken in the form of small group sessions, traditional CME lectures, hospital and clinic staff meetings and grand rounds. The content of the educational message was based upon the Principles of Judicious Antimicrobial. Use for pediatric upper respiratory infections (<LINK REF="REF-Dowell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowell 1998</LINK>) drafted by the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Patient and community education was primarily undertaken using printed educational materials produced by the CDC, which were distributed at hospitals, during doctor visits and at community centres and schools. Samples of this material can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/community/tools.htm. In addition, some studies used community meetings and local media to promote the judicious use of antibiotics. All of these studies were successful in significantly reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral respiratory tract infections. In the one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 2001</LINK>) the difference in the absolute change from baseline between intervention and controls was -0.07 antibiotic courses per person year for children aged between 3 to less than 36 months and -0.05 antibiotic courses per person year for children aged 36 to 72 months. When the effect of clustering and patient covariates were taken into account, the relative intervention effects were a reduction of 16% (5% to 23%) and 12% (2% to 21%) for these two age groups respectively. Belongia (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>) showed a change in the median number of prescriptions per clinician (reported here as the mean of liquid and solid preparations but reported separately in the study) of -17.5 between intervention and control regions. Perz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>) showed a reduction in the antibiotic prescription rate per 100 person-years by 20 in intervention regions compared with controls. Finally, Hennessy et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>) were able to reduce prescribing by 0.33 antibiotic courses per person in intervention villages compared to control villages. This intervention effect was maintained in the second year of the study.</P>
<P>In a CBA study, Gonzales and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzales 1999</LINK>) applied a full intervention (physician education and patient materials in the office and sent to homes) to one site and compared the effect to an intervention limited to patient education materials at another site and two (no intervention) control sites. This study demonstrated a substantial absolute reduction in prescribing from baseline for the full intervention site compared with controls (-24%) while the patient intervention alone had no significant effect (-3.0%). The remaining two studies demonstrated minimal (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flottorp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Flottorp 2002</LINK>) changes in prescribing despite extensive interventions. Stewart et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2000</LINK>) launched a community-wide intervention in a town in Canada to improve antibiotic prescribing but were able to demonstrate only a small reduction in the prescribing of second-line antibiotics compared with the remainder of the province; the odds ratio for prescribing in the pre- versus postintervention periods was 1.41 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.62). The Norwegian study (<LINK REF="STD-Flottorp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Flottorp 2002</LINK>) purported to use interventions that were tailored to locally identified barriers to change and included changes to the fee schedule for phone calls with patients in order to reduce the number of visits to physicians for sore throat and UTI. Despite this study's excellent design and execution, the authors could only demonstrate a minimal reduction in the use of antibiotics for sore throat (-3.0% compared with controls, P value 0.03).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 9: effect of any intervention versus control on bacterial resistance</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>. Among the 39 studies reviewed, only four studies simultaneously assessed the effect of the interventions on antimicrobial resistance in the study communities (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>). Seppala et al (<LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>) examined the effect of a reduction in consumption of macrolides on the rate of isolation of macrolide-resistant group A streptococci. The odds of an isolate being erythromycin resistant in 1996 were half the odds of it being resistant in 1992, indicating a significant reduction in the rate of resistance (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.5). This held true when the data were analysed by region. This data could not be subjected to time series analysis as there were an insufficient number of pre-intervention points.</P>
<P>The other three studies examined the effect of reducing overall antibiotic use in the study communities on the rate of isolation of penicillin-resistant <I>S. pneumoniae</I> from individuals in the community. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>) researchers measured the effect of the intervention on the rate of penicillin resistance (either intermediate or full resistance) in pneumococcal isolates from nasopharyngeal specimens. In a multivariate logistic regression model controlling for clustering of children within childcare centres, Belongia et al (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>) were unable to show a significant reduction in the odds of harbouring a penicillin-resistant pneumococcus for those living in an intervention community (odds ratio 0.46, 0.18 to 1.18). In Alaska, the proportion of pneumococcal isolates that were penicillin non-susceptible (with intermediate or full resistance) decreased from 41% to 29% in region A (intervention region) but did not significantly change in the control regions B and C (24% to 22%). In the second year of the study the intervention continued in region A and was expanded to regions B and C. The reduction in the rate of resistance observed in region A was not sustained and the proportion of pneumococci that were penicillin non-susceptible increased from 29% to 43%. In the expanded intervention regions the proportion of pneumococci that were penicillin non-susceptible did not change following the intervention (22% vs 26%).</P>
<P>In the community intervention study in Tennessee (<LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>), the effect of the intervention on the rate of pneumococcal resistance was assessed by examining the rate of isolation of resistant (intermediate or full resistance) pneumococci from sterile site isolates (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, other usually sterile body fluids) from children under 15 years of age. Despite a reduction in antibiotic use the proportion of isolates resistant to penicillin did not change over the three years of the study (60% year 1, 74% year 2 and 71% year 3).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 10: effect of delayed antibiotics versus immediate antibiotics on resolution of patient symptoms</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>. Two studies examining the effect of patient-based interventions on antibiotic use also examined the effect of withholding antibiotics on the clinical outcomes of enrolled patients (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>). In the study of delayed antibiotics for the common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>), patients completed daily symptom checklists until the tenth day after the initial medical visit. These checklists were collected and symptom scores were tabulated for the two groups (immediate and delayed prescription groups). It was found that patient temperatures and symptom scores (based on cough, nasal discharge, throat pain, headache etc, maximum possible score 15) for the two groups were essentially the same at various time points throughout the ten-day follow up.</P>
<P>In the otitis media study (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>), parents were requested to complete a daily diary regarding the presence of symptoms (earache, unwellness, sleep disturbance), perceived severity of pain, number of episodes of distress, use of paracetamol and temperature measurements. Overall, parents of children in the immediate antibiotic group reported fewer days of crying and sleep disturbance as well as less paracetamol use; however, there was no difference in mean pain scores, episodes of distress or absence from school.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given the broad array of targeted behaviours, the variation in interventions and the differences in the clinical settings, it is difficult to generalize the results from these individual studies and arrive at broadly applicable recommendations for improving antibiotic prescribing in all community settings. However, several general observations may be cautiously made. The simple, single-intervention studies (printed educational materials, audit and feedback) generally resulted in small (and some statistically significant) changes in prescribing behaviour. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated that passive methods of physician education such as didactic lectures or distribution or publication of printed educational materials without discussion have very limited impact (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1995</LINK>). The most plausible explanation for this is that these interventions often fail to address the root causes of inappropriate prescribing. Simply drawing the physician's attention to the behaviour (audit and feedback) or recommending an alternate behaviour (educational materials), or both, may not provide the physician with the tools to change a behaviour that is likely to be quite ingrained and multifactorial in origin. It bears mentioning that these low-cost interventions may result in cost savings to insurers even if the results are marginal given the high cost of prescription medications; however, only one study performed an economic analysis reporting a cost saving from unsolicited mailed audit and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Hux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hux 1999</LINK>). Small changes in prescribing are unlikely, however, to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a community.</P>
<P>One exceptional result was the impressive change in macrolide use in Finland, following publication of a guideline recommending against the use of this class of antibiotics for group A streptococcal infection in favour of the use of penicillin. This result is unexpected given the limited effect of published guidelines on physician behaviour. The impetus for the publication of the guideline was concern about potential treatment failures for serious group A streptococcal infections due to the high rate of macrolide resistance in Finland. This emphasis on patient safety may account for the impressive impact of the written recommendations compared with other studies of this type of intervention. In addition, a recommendation promoting the use of particular first-line antibiotics over other agents may be more easily adopted by physicians than recommendations to cease prescribing antibiotics for inappropriate indications.<BR/>
<B> <BR/>
</B>Large didactic lectures, like those attended at conferences, and unsolicited audit and feedback are similar in their passive nature to printed educational materials. It has been suggested in other systematic reviews that interactive educational meetings as opposed to didactic lectures (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2004c</LINK>) or more complex audit and feedback delivery (coupled with local guideline development or peer comparison feedback) (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2004</LINK>) might produce greater changes in physician behaviour; but definitive data is lacking. In this review, all of the studies examining the effect of educational meetings utilizing interactive workshops produced modest but statistically significant results. The two studies directly comparing large, didactic lectures to smaller interactive workshops reported greater improvement in prescribing for the participants of the interactive workshops (<LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physician reminders have been successful in improving prescribing behaviour in a number of settings (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2003</LINK>). Information provided at the time of prescribing using an online prescription writer significantly reduced the number of patients receiving long courses of antibiotics for otitis media but did not reduce the number receiving antibiotics at all (although this was a secondary outcome) (<LINK REF="STD-Christakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christakis 2001</LINK>). Prompts to calculate a score to predict the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis in sore throat patients showed promise in a preliminary study but application in a setting where repeated use was required was not successful (<LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIsaac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McIsaac 2002</LINK>). Thus, the effects of physician reminders in studies reported here were mixed and the number of studies too small to draw any concrete conclusions. </P>
<P>Patient-based interventions appeared to be effective in some settings. Patient educational materials, along with limited physician education, produced small changes in the rate of prescribing antibiotics for viral respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzales 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mainous-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mainous 2000</LINK>). Multi-faceted interventions involving physicians, patient and community education consistently produced moderate changes in prescribing behaviours. There was one study in this group that documented a sustained reduction in prescribing in the year following the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>). It is of interest that one of the best-designed studies in this review, from Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Flottorp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Flottorp 2002</LINK>), where researchers designed the intervention to specifically address previously identified barriers to change reported in no significant change in antibiotic use for sore throat. The authors hypothesized that this may have been due to the passive nature of the interventions or inadequate duration of follow up. </P>
<P>Several studies used a novel concept of providing a delayed antibiotic prescription to allow time for the natural resolution of an infection, in cases where this was likely to occur. Thus, antibiotics were reserved for those situations where the infection failed to resolve in a timely fashion (three to seven days). The rationale was that patients who desired but did not require antibiotics would be satisfied to know they could have antibiotics in several days if they were not feeling better, but most would not need to retrieve or fill the prescription. For future illnesses, these patients would know that the natural history of these infections is spontaneous resolution and they would not demand antibiotics or even attend the clinic for the same problem. All of these studies demonstrated that when patients were asked to delay obtaining or filling an antibiotic prescription, they were much less likely to fill it than those offered an immediate prescription (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macfarlane-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Macfarlane 2002</LINK>). Not surprisingly, significant patient morbidity was not observed as antibiotics will have no impact on the resolution of viral infections. It is important, however, to have data that demonstrates this lack of morbidity for illnesses such as acute bronchitis and purulent rhinitis where the etiologic agent, while usually viral, is thought to be bacterial by many practitioners. The demonstration that there is no benefit with immediate use of antibiotics may serve to convince many physicians and patients that antibiotics are not needed for these conditions. Delayed prescriptions for acute otitis media in children are frequently used in many European countries but have not gained popularity in North America. The study by Little (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>) demonstrated that waiting a few days to use an antibiotic among children diagnosed with otitis media did not increase morbidity from this disease either. It has been argued that studies like this do not validly assess the effect of antibiotics on acute otitis media as the diagnostic criteria are not strict enough, leading to the inclusion of many patients who did not truly have bacterial otitis media; however, this argument only serves to strengthen the conclusions from this study that antibiotics are not required for most of the cases of acute otitis media diagnosed in the primary care setting most likely because this condition is over diagnosed. Withholding immediate antibiotic helps to weed out those children with URIs and red tympanic membranes from those with true bacterial middle ear disease, leading to more appropriate antibiotic use. One important caveat in the interpretation of these studies is that these interventions appear to be very successful because all patients in the control arms were given prescriptions to fill immediately, making the antibiotic use rate in these groups close to 100%; which is very different from the antibiotic-use rates in control groups from other types of studies. </P>
<P>There were five studies performed in the following non-industrialised nations: Sri Lanka, Zambia, South Africa, Mexico and Indonesia. The World Health Organisation has, under the auspices of the Essential Drugs Program, produced a book called the Guide to Good Prescribing. The intervention in two of five of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>) was based upon this guide. These five studies were unique in that they involved predominantly non-physician prescribers. One study examined physicians only (Mexico); one used physicians and non-physician prescribers (Sri Lanka); and three had non-physician prescribers, for example clinical officers and nurses (Zambia, South Africa, Indonesia). Two of these studies based prescribing recommendations on prescribing guidelines produced through international development agencies: World Health Organisation Guide (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>), Swedish International Development Authority (<LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>). In all these studies, educational meetings with or without additional interventions (for example audit and feedback) were compared with no-intervention control groups. The changes in prescribing ranged from minimal (<LINK REF="STD-Angunawela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angunawela 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bexell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bexell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santoso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santoso 1996</LINK>) to moderate (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Cuevas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Cuevas 1996</LINK>). Despite the greater difficulties in controlling prescribing in non-industrialized settings, these results appeared to be slightly better than results from studies examining the efficacy of educational meetings in industrialized countries. This may be due to the use of non-physician prescribers who may have fewer barriers to changing behaviour than physicians. What is certain is that these differences confirm the need to address interventions to specific healthcare settings and barriers to change as identified in these settings in order for them to be effective.</P>
<P>It appears that interventions aimed at increasing the prescribing of certain recommended first-line antibiotics for specific infections are more likely to produce substantial changes in prescribing than those interventions targeting overall inappropriate antibiotic use. As discussed in the introduction, the root causes of antibiotic misuse in the community outpatient setting are manifold and may include physicians succumbing to pressure from patients, lack of understanding by the physician as to the necessity for antibiotics in certain clinical conditions, diagnostic uncertainty as to the true nature of the patient's illness, and constraints on the physician's time to explain the nature of the illness and the reasons an antibiotic is not indicated. Convincing a physician or patient that a particular antibiotic (usually the most narrow-spectrum agent for the condition) should be his or her first choice should be relatively easy as long as appropriate justification for the recommendation is made. It stands to reason, however, that completely eliminating prescribing for a particular indication, such as a viral URI, in a clinical situation in which the physician would usually prescribe an unnecessary antibiotic would be a difficult behavioural change. While this generally holds true for most of the reviewed studies, promoting the prescribing of first-line agents was not as straightforward a task as might be predicted. One potential explanation for this is that physicians may consider these prescribing recommendations a limitation to their clinical freedom. In addition, physicians want to prescribe what they think are the best medications for individual patients, which often means a broad-spectrum agent to protect against potentially resistant organisms, regardless of the ecological consequences. </P>
<P>None of the trials addressed changes in the rates of adverse drug reactions as a result of improved prescribing of oral antibiotics. Several of the trials addressed other patient-based outcomes such as changes in antibiotic-resistance patterns as a result of altered antibiotic use (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>) and illness outcomes following the withholding of antibiotics for certain conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Arroll-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2001</LINK>). Over the intervention periods (usually between one and three years) no substantial or persistent reductions in the incidence of resistant bacteria (either colonizing or as a cause of infection) were observed in any of the studies except for the Finnish macrolide study (<LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>) where a reduction was observed in macrolide resistance rates after approximately two years and was sustained over three years. This sustained reduction was unlikely to be due to natural variation in resistance rates. In contrast, no sustained reduction in penicillin resistance was observed with overall reductions in antibiotic use in several communities (<LINK REF="STD-Belongia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belongia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perz 2002</LINK>). The initial reduction in the carrier rate of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in Alaska (<LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>) was most likely due to natural variation in resistance rates as this change did not persist in the second year of the study despite sustained reductions in prescribing. The reason for this lack of effect on antibiotic resistant rates has been suggested by mathematical modelling of the rates of change of antibiotic-resistance among bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1998</LINK>). The conclusions from the model suggest that the time to observation of reductions in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant organisms is substantially longer than the preceding time to reach high levels of resistance. Thus it may be many years before sustained reductions in antibiotic use produce reductions in penicillin-resistant pneumococci. In addition, larger reductions in antibiotic use may be necessary to produce more rapid changes in resistance patterns. This is well demonstrated in the Finnish macrolide study where changes in antibiotic consumption preceded changes in macrolide resistance rates by approximately three years. Assessing the full effect of reductions in community-wide antibiotic use may be made complicated by the already observed reductions in invasive pneumococcal infections in immunized children and their contacts due to the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines. </P>
<P>Finally, it is important to determine if the intervention effect wanes over time. This would not be unexpected as it has been demonstrated that the degree to which physicians adhere to recommended management of certain conditions (hypertension, viral respiratory tract infection) is associated with the time since graduation from medical school; thus by extension, the further out from the intervention the more likely the physician may be to slip back into old patterns of behaviour. The durability of the effect of an intervention on physician prescribing behaviour was evaluated in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ray-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>). Reassuringly, all three studies demonstrated that the intervention effect on prescribing behaviour was maintained over an additional year following the end of the intervention (for Ray and Hennessy). Only the ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1997</LINK>) demonstrated a prolonged effect from the intervention, reporting data for fours years following the publication of prescribing recommendations.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The selection of the most effective intervention to improve the prescribing of antibiotics appears to be condition and situation specific. In designing an intervention to change a particular prescribing behaviour the ultimate goal of the intervention must be defined and local barriers to change identified and addressed. Small changes in prescribing, which may be cost-effective, may be achieved using simple interventions such as guideline publication and distribution, didactic educational meetings and audit and feedback. However, these interventions are unlikely to lead to a reduction in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing community-acquired infection. The one exception to this was the Finnish study which resulted in a major, sustained reduction in prescribing of macrolides for group A streptococcal infection but this cannot be expected to occur in most settings following guideline publication. </P>
<P>Higher complexity interventions appear to be more effective in changing antibiotic-prescribing behaviours. Interactive workshops, educational outreach, physician reminders and multi-faceted interventions which provide education to healthcare providers, patients and the general public in a variety of formats may produce moderate changes and, in an environment of highly-motivated prescribers, could have a large impact on antibiotic prescribing. However, very few of these studies provided information on the durability of the effect of the intervention. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of such interventions has not been established. </P>
<P>If one is attempting to reduce the use of antibiotics for certain conditions (viral respiratory tract infections, as an example), using a delayed prescription may be the most effective intervention with low cost and great appeal to physicians who feel they are frequently pressured for antibiotics. These prescriptions appear to satisfy patients, however, most do not fill the prescription as they are able, by delaying, to see that the illness is self-limited. Other studies have shown that patients who do not take antibiotics for viral illnesses are less likely to attend clinic for a similar problem in the future. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Multi-faceted interventions appear to play an important role in reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in the community setting as these interventions reach a large number of physicians and healthcare consumers. Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is required to determine their applicability outside the research setting. In addition, studies to determine which aspects of these interventions provide the greatest benefit might aid in reducing the complexity in their implementation, which might improve uptake of these interventions. Devising innovative, simple interventions such as delayed antibiotic prescriptions or reminders is another important focus for ongoing research in this area. </P>
<P>Long-term follow up of physicians in regions where successful interventions have been undertaken would provide needed information regarding the durability of the effect. In addition, surveillance for antibiotic-resistant pathogens in these regions over a span of several years (five to ten) would provide desired information concerning the effect of sustained reductions in antibiotic use on these pathogens. The best study design for new evaluations with long-term follow up would be interrupted time series as this lends itself well to a longer duration of evaluation. It would help to minimize the effects of normal fluctuations in resistance rates that may be observed over shorter periods of time, as seen in the CDC Alaskan village study (<LINK REF="STD-Hennessy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennessy 2002</LINK>). Further, it would obviate the need to withhold an effective intervention from a control region simply to obtain follow-up data.<BR/> </P>

<P>Another interpretation of data, by time series analysis (not performed by study authors), is that the pre-intervention slope is 3.95 prescriptions per month (SE 3.68; P value 0.29), there is a large decrease in number of prescriptions of -1532.34 (SE 88.10; P value &lt;0.001) followed by a postintervention slope of 10.74 prescriptions per month (SE 10.86; P value 0.33). Although slopes are not statistically significant there may be a trend toward an increasing the number of prescriptions postintervention such that the initial effect of the intervention wanes over time and is less than -1532.34 by the end of the study period.</P>
