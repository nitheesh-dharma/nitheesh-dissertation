<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-02 13:20:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychological interventions (for example, distraction, hypnosis, coping skills training) are treatments used to reduce pain and distress (anxiety and fear, or both) that children and adolescents experience while undergoing medical procedures involving needles. There is strong evidence that distraction and hypnosis are effective in reducing the pain and distress that children and adolescents experience during needle procedures. Distraction techniques can often be quite simple, such as reading the child stories, watching television, listening to music, or talking about something other than the needle. Sometimes parents or nurses are involved in helping to distract the child, although that is not always necessary. Interventions such as hypnosis may require some teaching by a trained professional for a child to learn. Other psychological treatments, such as explaining what is going to happen before or during the procedure (labelled 'providing information or preparation or both'), using virtual reality (for example, interactive video equipment, goggles, computers showing images, games, stories), or a combination of various strategies have been tested. More research is needed to know whether they are effective for reducing children's pain and distress during needles.</P>

<P>This review is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2006. Needle-related procedures are a common source of pain and distress for children. Our previous review on this topic indicated that a number of psychological interventions were efficacious in managing pediatric needle pain, including distraction, hypnosis, and combined cognitive behavioural interventions. Considerable additional research in the area has been published since that time.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-11 13:31:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leah T Wofsy">
<P>To provide an update to our 2006 review assessing the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-03 16:21:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches of the following databases were conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and Web of Science. Requests for relevant studies were also posted on various electronic list servers. We ran an updated search in March 2012, and again in March 2013.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-02 15:05:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Participants included children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related procedures. Only RCTs with at least five participants in each study arm comparing a psychological intervention group with a control or comparison group were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-03 15:58:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and a third author helped with data extraction and coding for one non-English study. Included studies were coded for quality using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for all analyses using Review Manager 5.2 software.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-04 13:20:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-nine trials with 3394 participants were included. The most commonly studied needle procedures were venipuncture, intravenous (IV) line insertion, and immunization. Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with the most evidence available for children under 12 years of age. Consistent with the original review, the most commonly studied psychological interventions for needle procedures were distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The majority of included studies (19 of 39) examined distraction only. The additional studies from this review update continued to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis. No evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT (at least two or more cognitive or behavioural strategies combined), parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress. No conclusions could be drawn about interventions of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as evidence was available from single studies only. In addition, the Risk of bias scores indicated several domains with high or unclear bias scores (for example, selection, detection, and performance bias) suggesting that the methodological rigour and reporting of RCTs of psychological interventions continue to have considerable room for improvement.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-03 16:21:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents, with no evidence currently available for preparation and information or both, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality. Additional research is needed to further assess interventions that have only been investigated in one RCT to date (that is, memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, and distraction plus suggestion). There are continuing issues with the quality of trials examining psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Medical procedures are a common source of pain and distress for children. Healthy children undergo immunizations repeatedly throughout childhood. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 2004</LINK>), the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2004</LINK>), the American Academy of Family Physicians (<LINK REF="REF-AAFP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAFP 2004</LINK>), and the Canadian Paediatric Society (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 2004</LINK>) all recommend over 20 various immunizations before age 18 years. Children with chronic illnesses experience an even greater number of painful procedures, as part of the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of their condition. In a hospital setting, children often experience unpredictable and severe procedure-related pain (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1996</LINK>) that can be associated with negative emotional and psychological implications (<LINK REF="REF-Kazak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazak 2001</LINK>). Despite the prevalence of pain stemming from medical procedures and the distress associated with this, research indicates that pain management continues to be suboptimal. For example, a recent investigation of the epidemiology and management of painful procedures in children in Canadian hospitals found that 78% of patients admitted to inpatient units had undergone a painful procedure; however, less than a third of the painful procedures had documented pain management interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence-based clinical guidelines for reducing the pain of childhood vaccinations do exist (<LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2010</LINK>). These guidelines promote a '3-P' approach to pain management, which includes pharmacological, physical, and psychological factors. In terms of psychological approaches, the guidelines recommend various cognitive and behavioural techniques that are effective at reducing vaccination pain (for example, deep breathing) as well as various techniques that are ineffective for vaccination pain (for example telling children reassuring comments like 'it won't hurt').</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Medical procedures, particularly needles, are among the most feared experiences of children (<LINK REF="REF-Broome-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1990</LINK>). It is important to note that identifying positive adaptive or negative maladaptive intervention strategies should be based on evidence. While intuitively it might appear that reassurance (for example, saying 'don't worry' or 'it&#8217;s going to be ok') would help to decrease pain and distress during needle procedures, there is a large body of evidence to indicate that it is actually distress-promoting (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Manimala-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manimala 2000</LINK>). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this, including reassurance indicating to the child that the parent is worried, reinforcement of child distress behaviours by attention, or permission to the child to freely express his or her distress (<LINK REF="REF-McMurtry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurtry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMurtry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurtry 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of psychological interventions for managing pain and distress in children are available, of which the majority are cognitive behavioural in nature. Although non-pharmacological interventions for pain that are not cognitive behavioural exist (for example, acupuncture, heat or cold), these interventions were not included in the present review. The borderline between psychological and non-psychological interventions is difficult to define, often because some interventions could arguably fit into more than one category. For example, coughing and deep breathing could both arguably fall under the categories of psychological (for example, distraction) or physical interventions. We would argue that the classification of interventions into distinct mutually exclusive categories would misrepresent the processes involved.</P>
<P>Cognitive interventions include techniques that target negative or unrealistic thoughts to help replace them with more positive beliefs and attitudes (for example, saying positive self-statements such as 'I can get through this' instead of 'this is going to hurt'). Behavioural interventions include techniques that target negative or maladaptive behaviours to help replace them with more positive and adaptive behaviours (for example, watching a funny movie instead of talking about how much the needle will hurt). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) uses a combination or variation of cognitive or behavioural, or both, strategies targeting both thoughts and behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1999</LINK>). CBT for pain management aims to help individuals develop and use coping skills to manage their pain and distress, and can include various techniques such as distraction, relaxation training, deep breathing, hypnosis, preparing for and rehearsing the procedure in advance, using positive reinforcement for adaptive behaviours, making positive coping statements, and receiving coaching to use adaptive strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000a</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Christophersen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christophersen 2001</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Keefe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 1992</LINK>). While it can be challenging to identify the exact processes or mechanisms that each of the interventions target, efficacy is in part a function of many dimensions such as intervention novelty, engagement, and developmental appropriateness.</P>
<P>As noted above, although CBT-based interventions are often described as 'psychological' in nature, this does not mean they are limited to use or direction by psychologists. On the contrary, most of these techniques are quite straightforward (for example, distraction, deep breathing), require no intensive training to use, and can be delivered by various healthcare workers (for example, nurses, child life specialists) as well as family members, such as parents. However, certain techniques do require some training and knowledge for maximum effectiveness (for example, diaphragmatic breathing is more involved than taking a few deep breaths).</P>
<P>Operational definitions of specific cognitive or behavioural interventions (for example, hypnosis, memory alteration, distraction) are available by request from the authors.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>Cognitive interventions include techniques that target negative or unrealistic thoughts to help replace them with more positive beliefs and attitudes (for example, saying positive self-statements such as 'I can get through this' instead of 'this is going to hurt'). Behavioural interventions include techniques that target negative or maladaptive behaviours to help replace them with more positive and adaptive behaviours (for example, watching a funny movie instead of talking about how much the needle will hurt). CBT uses a combination or variation of cognitive or behavioural, or both, strategies targeting both thoughts and behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1999</LINK>). For the purpose of this review, all of the cognitive, behavioural, and cognitive behavioural strategies described above fall under the overarching category of &#8216;psychological&#8217; interventions. As a whole, psychological interventions for pain management aim to help individuals develop and use coping skills to manage their pain and distress, and can include various techniques such as distraction, relaxation training, deep breathing, hypnosis, preparing for and rehearsing the procedure in advance, using positive reinforcement for adaptive behaviours, making positive coping statements, and receiving coaching to use adaptive strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christophersen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christophersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keefe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 1992</LINK>).</P>

<P>Several narrative, non-systematic reviews and book chapters on psychological interventions for the management of procedural pain and distress in children are available (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Alvarez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blount-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blount 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christophersen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christophersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2005</LINK>). These reviews have typically concluded that psychological interventions are beneficial; however, the lack of a systematic and pooled approach to integrating the literature is problematic and can mean that only limited conclusions regarding the efficacy of these interventions are made. Although there have been a few examples of more systematic approaches to integrating this literature (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Broome-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleiber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleiber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luebbert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luebbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saile-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saile 1988</LINK>), these reviews have tended to adopt a more limited focus (for example, examining the effects of only one type of intervention such as distraction) and many are out of date given the rapid growth of research in this area in recent years.</P>
<P>We conducted and published our original Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2008</LINK>) to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the efficacy of different psychological interventions for managing procedure-related pain and distress in children. Based on that original review, we established the efficacy of several interventions (namely distraction, hypnosis, and CBT) and made several clinical and research recommendations, including identifying interventions requiring further research. We also made recommendations for improving the quality of trials in the area, which were explored in more depth and outlined in a subsequent paper (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2010</LINK>). At the time of our initial review only 28 RCTs met our inclusion criteria and provided the necessary data for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Since the publication of our initial review, considerable additional research in the area has been published. Therefore, this updated review was meant to expand upon our original review by identifying and including the more recent RCTs and synthesizing the results of these more contemporary studies with our prior work to make stronger conclusions about the efficacy of these interventions. We also used a risk of bias measure in this update to evaluate the risk of bias for all of the included studies. The current updated review combines findings across a larger sample, which strengthens and expands our conclusions regarding the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents.</P>
<P>Although we wished to conduct sensitivity analyses to examine more specific age ranges or developmental periods, the broadness and variability in the study sample age ranges limited these analyses. In addition, the majority of RCTs in this area assessed single event needle procedures rather than repeated or multiple needle 
procedures, thereby precluding the ability to assess this area further. As such, we did not include these analyses in this updated review but acknowledge the importance of these areas of inquiry for future research.</P>

<P>Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least five participants in each study arm were included. In contrast to our original review in which we included quasi-randomized trials (for example, alternative assignment) in a sensitivity analysis, for this updated review we included only true RCT designs and excluded all quasi-randomized trials. A study was deemed to be a true RCT if the authors explicitly stated that participants were randomly assigned to groups (for example, assignment was determined using a table of random numbers) and did not indicate using quasi-randomization methods (for example, alternating assignment) at any point in the paper. For example, some authors may describe the study as an RCT in the title or abstract but later report quasi-randomization techniques in the methods sections. A true RCT is one that is described as such throughout the entire paper. While we were more lenient in the original review and included a few studies reporting quasi-randomization procedures, these studies were excluded from the present review in order to be more consistent and stringent in our approach. In addition, unlike in our original review, we included only published trials and therefore excluded any non-published trials (for example, dissertations). No language restrictions were used during the search and translations were obtained when necessary.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-09-03 16:02:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies involving children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related medical procedures were included. For the purposes of this review, a needle-related medical procedure was defined as any procedure performed as part of a medical diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. This included dental procedures (excluding dental surgery) but did not include procedures such as body piercings or tattoos, which involve needles but are not performed for medical purposes. The search was limited to needle-related pain, which is among the most commonly occurring and feared procedures for both healthy and chronically-ill children (<LINK REF="REF-Broome-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1990</LINK>). Our justification for not including children less than two years of age is that the majority of psychological interventions examined in this review are either not appropriate for use with infants or are qualitatively different when applied to infants. The efficacy of psychological interventions for procedural pain and distress in infants has been addressed in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Pillai_x002d_Riddell-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai-Riddell 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pillai_x002d_Riddell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai-Riddell 2011b</LINK>). For both the original review and this review update, we included studies with participants ranging from two to 19 years of age. A maximum age of 19 years was chosen to ensure that our search was limited to children and adolescents only, and is also consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of adolescence, which defines it as ranging from 10 to 19 years (<A HREF="http://www.searo.who.int/en/section13/section1245_4980.htm">http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section13/Section1245_4980.htm</A>). The age range was kept broad so as to not exclude any relevant studies; however, studies that included any participants falling outside of this age range were excluded unless authors were able to provide data for only the age range specified for this review while also continuing to meet the minimum criterion of five participants per group.</P>
<P>We included studies examining medical procedures from the same list of procedures identified in our prior review (please see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the list of medical procedures and their definitions). Definitions were derived from online medical dictionaries (for example, MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia, <LINK REF="REF-MedLine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MedLine 2004</LINK>; On-Line Medical Dictionary, <LINK REF="REF-OLMD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">OLMD 2004</LINK>) and by consulting with medical professionals in the area of pediatric pain. Participants included healthy children and children with chronic or transitory illnesses from both inpatient and outpatient settings. Studies including patients with known needle phobias (that is, diagnosed by a qualified professional such as a psychologist) were excluded. While we acknowledge that needle fears are quite prevalent and some youth included in the reviewed studies may have had undiagnosed phobias, this criterion was established in an attempt to distinguish between typical needle fears or ones that are extreme enough to have warranted assessment and diagnosis prior to the study. Furthermore, children undergoing surgery were excluded because numerous factors specific to surgery or being in intensive care units can complicate and interfere with the accuracy of self-reported accounts of pain and distress. These factors may include sedation, inability to verbalize because of intubation, more intensive pharmacological interventions, long-term hospital stays, inability or difficulty attributing pain or distress to one specific medical procedure, and difficulty distinguishing between the pain and distress caused by the procedure versus the medical condition requiring the surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2004</LINK>). The exception to this was for studies that assessed the efficacy of a psychological intervention for a pre-surgical needle procedure such as an intravenous (IV) insertion. The outcome measures of interest had to be completed prior to surgery or sedation in order for the study to be included in this review.</P>

<P>Studies were included if at least one trial arm consisted of a psychological intervention, and there was a comparator control arm, other active treatment, treatment as usual, or waiting list control. We excluded studies in which the psychological intervention(s) was combined with a non-psychological intervention (for example, pharmacological intervention) when the unique effects of the psychological intervention could not be evaluated.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-09-04 13:21:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two measured outcomes of interest were pain and distress, assessed using scales or measures with established reliability and validity (that is, as evidenced in at least one prior study published in a peer-reviewed journal). For this review, pain was operationalized using the definition proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), describing pain as: &#8220;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-IASP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IASP 2004</LINK>). In addition, distress was broadly defined as any type of negative affect associated with the procedure (for example, anxiety, stress, fear). Because the main focus of this review was the data pooling component (that is, the meta-analysis), as with the original review, RCTs were excluded if the data necessary for data pooling (for example, means, SDs, cell sizes) were not available in the published study, could not be identified through contact with the study authors, or could not be calculated based on other data provided (for example, confidence intervals).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2) Observer Global Reports</HEADING>
<P>Observer versions of the self-report measures for pain and distress listed above (completed by parents, caregivers, nurses, doctors, or other hospital staff present) were also included. It is important to note that there are various factors affecting the degree to which observer reports are positively correlated with self-reports of pain and distress, such as the person completing the report (that is, mother, nurse, or doctor) and the age of the child (<LINK REF="REF-Champion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Champion 1998</LINK>). Despite these caveats, observer reports of pain and distress can provide valuable information, particularly for younger children.</P>

 the CAMPIS-revised (<LINK REF="REF-Blount-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blount 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blount-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blount 1997</LINK>), and the CAMPIS-short form (<LINK REF="REF-Blount-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blount 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>While developmental and age factors are important considerations when selecting appropriate outcome measures, there is still considerable variability in selecting outcome measures and many are used for a broad range of ages. However, systematic reviews of self-report of pain intensity in youth aged zero to 18 years note that no scale is uniformly appropriate across development and there continues to be debate about the choice of scale to use (<LINK REF="REF-Stinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stinson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 2010</LINK>). The more recent <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 2010</LINK> review suggests that faces scales are frequently used; the most widely used with the best validity are currently the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (<LINK REF="REF-Hicks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hicks 2001</LINK>), the Oucher pain scale (<LINK REF="REF-Beyer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beyer 1992</LINK>), and the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1988</LINK>). However, it is important to note that several studies have found that faces scales starting with smiling no-pain anchors, such as the WBFPRS, tend to result in greater pain ratings compared to scales starting with neutral non-smiling pain anchors because they may confound affective states with pain ratings (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1998</LINK>). In addition, although many faces scales are validated and used with younger children (three to five years), it has been found that children this young often demonstrate response biases, such as choosing only the lowest or highest anchors (for example, <LINK REF="REF-von-Baeyer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Baeyer 2009</LINK>). Thus, self-reports of pain from preschoolers should be interpreted with caution and complementary observational assessments (for example, by parents) are also recommended. However, there are systematic discounting biases in some studies of parental and staff proxy ratings whereby more weight is given to certain scales or raters (for example, giving more weight to parent reports and less weight to child reports). For these reasons, it can be helpful for studies to incorporate various measures of pain and distress by different raters (for example, child, parent, staff) and this is the reason we chose to evaluate these outcomes separately in this review.</P>
<P>However, is it worth noting that there is also variability among observational assessments of pain and distress. In another systematic review of observational (behavioural) measures of pain for youth three to 18 years old, it was noted that pain intensity measures are not generally age-normed and there are often no separated versions of observational scales for different ages. Rather, although most observational scales were originally developed for specific ages ranges, they have been applied or expanded to a broader age range. However, despite this important issue, which warrants further research, the results of the systematic review did recommend using certain observational scales (that is, FLACC and CHEOPS) based on their sound psychometric properties for youth in this age range undergoing painful medical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-von-Baeyer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Baeyer 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4) Physiological Measures</HEADING>
<P>Measures of pain and distress that are practical to quantify in clinical setting may include (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1998</LINK>):</P>
<P>&#8226; heart rate (generally increases with pain);</P>
<P>&#8226; respiratory rate (may increase or decrease with pain and distress or both);</P>
<P>&#8226; blood pressure (generally increases with pain and distress or both);</P>
<P>&#8226; oxygen saturation (generally decreases with pain and distress or both);</P>
<P>&#8226; cortisol levels (generally increase with pain and distress or both);</P>
<P>&#8226; transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO<SUB>2</SUB>) (generally decreases with pain and distress or both);</P>
<P>&#8226; transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCO<SUB>2</SUB>) (may increase or decrease with pain and distress or both).</P>
<P>Despite concerns regarding the tendency of physiological measures to habituate in response to pain and distress, as well as a lack of data supporting the specificity of these measures to pain (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 1998</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1998</LINK>), physiological measures have frequently been assessed as outcomes in pain studies, and were therefore included as outcomes in this review. However, it is important to note that all self- and observer-rated measures of pain and distress are subjective, given that pain is a subjective experience based on a variety of factors (for example, pain threshold, previous experiences with pain, etc).</P>

<P>Through consultation with a reference librarian and with assistance from the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Group, detailed search strategies were developed to search the following six electronic databases for relevant trials:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 2);</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE (1966 to March 2013) ;</LI>

<LI>Web of Science (IBI Web of Knowledge) (March 2013).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For this updated review, the same database search terms were used as in the original review; however, we extended the search date to cover the period from when the last update ended (2005) to March 2013. Thus, altogether, the database searches covered the period from their inception to March 2013. Because we opted to include only published studies for this current review update, we excluded one additional database searched in the original review (that is, Dissertation Abstracts International). A similar search strategy was adapted for each of the databases but additional related keywords and MeSH terms were included as appropriate for each specific database.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (LU and CC) independently screened titles and abstracts of trials from literature searches for inclusion in the original review, and two additional review authors (MN and KB) independently screened titles and abstracts for the review update. For all abstracts that were relevant, potentially relevant, or where relevance to the current review was unclear, the full articles were obtained and read by one of the study authors. Using the full articles, two review authors (LU and CC for the original review, and MN and KB for the updated review) decided which studies did and did not meet the inclusion criteria. Review authors were not blind to the authors, institutions, journals, or results. A third review author (PM for the original review, and LU for the updated review) was brought in to help resolve any issues or selection discrepancies that arose.</P>
<P>As noted above, to increase the methodological quality of the studies included in this updated review, we imposed more stringent inclusion criteria for this review update as compared to the original review. Specifically, for this review update we omitted any non-published studies (for example, unpublished dissertations) and quasi-randomized trials (that is, anything other than reporting true random assignment, as described above). In our original review, contact with some study authors clarified that the assignment they used was indeed random assignment although it was not described as such in the paper (for example, described in the abstract as an RCT but described in the methods as using alternating assignment). Thus, to be consistent across all studies, those reporting quasi-randomized procedures in the published studies were excluded from this update even if they were included in the original review.</P>
<P>A total of 28 RCTs were retrieved and included in the original review, although for the current update we excluded seven of these studies because they were unpublished dissertations or reported quasi-randomized methods (that is, alternating assignment). In March 2012, our updated search strategy identified 18 additional RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria and having the necessary data to be included in this update. An additional search in March 2013 did not identify any further studies. Thus, a total of 39 RCTs (retrieved from the original and updated searches) were included in this updated review; all of these included RCTs were coded in full. The references for these studies are all provided below in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (LU and CC) extracted data using a data extraction form designed for the original review, and two additional review authors (MN and KB) performed data extraction for additional studies identified in the review update. In addition, another researcher who was fluent in Farsi confirmed inclusion eligibility and conducted data extraction for one non-English study identified from our updated search. Data were extracted on various details relating to study design, participant demographics, diagnosis (when applicable), needle procedure, type of intervention and control conditions, outcomes, as well as other related variables. A third review author (PM for the original review, and LU for the updated review) was available to help resolve any coding discrepancies. Data from the studies were extracted using paper data extraction sheets developed for this review and were also entered into electronic spreadsheets to differentiate between included versus excluded studies. Attempts were made to obtain missing data (for example, means, SDs, cell sizes) from the authors, whenever feasible, to include in the meta-analysis. All data for the included studies were first recorded on paper data extraction forms by review authors (LU for the original review, and MN and KB for the updated review) and reviewed for errors by a trained research assistant. All data suitable for pooling were analysed using RevMan 5.1 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>In the original review, each included study was scored independently for quality by two review authors using the Oxford Quality Scale created by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>. We also completed a more extensive quality analysis of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2010</LINK>) given that the Oxford Quality Rating Scale is more appropriate for double-blind studies (for example, pharmacological interventions); and psychological interventions, unlike placebo studies, typically cannot be truly double-blind. For the purpose of this updated review, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool as a measure of trial quality. The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/">www.cochrane-handbook.org/</A>) distinguishes between methodological quality assessment and risk of bias, and recommends a focus on the latter (please refer to the Cochrane Handbook for a detailed account of reasons why). The Risk of bias tool is a two-part tool assessing seven areas: adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and study personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data addressed, free of selective reporting, and other biases. All included studies from the original review and those identified in this update were independently coded by two review authors (MN and KB) who then compared responses to reach consensus. This procedure was verified with, and endorsed by, the Cochrane PaPaS Review Group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>Given the nature of the outcome measures in this review, all of the outcome data for the included studies were continuous (for example, rating scales). Consistent with the analytical approach used in the original review, and as is recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration, we computed standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), which allowed us to combine the results from different scales measuring the same construct (for example, pain). We proposed that when sufficient data were available from various studies using the same measurement instruments, a weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI would also be conducted. However, given the wide range of different assessment measures used, this was not feasible. Thus, all mean differences presented in the tables and plots of the results section represent SMDs.</P>
<P>Each psychological intervention was assessed separately in a meta-analysis because the interventions were considered too different to combine. However, within each intervention we analysed each outcome measure separately. Thus, for each intervention the following seven outcomes were separately assessed.</P>
<P>a) Pain: self-reports.</P>
<P>b) Pain: observer global reports.</P>
<P>c) Pain: behavioural measures.</P>
<P>d) Distress: self-reports.</P>
<P>e) Distress: observer global reports.</P>
<P>f) Distress: behavioural measures.</P>
<P>g) Physiological measures: each physiological outcome (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure) was assessed separately.
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>In this context, unit of analysis issues refer to the level at which randomization occurs. For example, in most situations the number of observations analysed should match the number of 'units' that were randomized. In a simple, parallel two-group RCT (intervention versus control), participants would be randomized to one of the two groups and a single measurement for each outcome would be collected and analysed. For the current review, we included and analysed parallel two-group RCTs as well as cluster-randomized trials (that is, groups of individuals randomized together to the same intervention). In addition, we also included cross-over trials (that is, participants undergo more than one intervention); however, we only included these studies if the data were available separately for each group following the first treatment arm. For example, in a treatment (n = 50) versus control (n = 50) two-group design we required the data for the first treatment arm (treatment group versus control) before the groups crossed over and the conditions were reversed rather than the overall combined values for all treatment values compared to all control values. The rationale for this decision was based on the belief that once a psychological intervention (for example, distraction, hypnosis) has been introduced and taught to participants, it is difficult to prevent participants from using these strategies themselves (for example, cognitive distraction techniques) even if they are then switched to a control condition. Lastly, we also included studies using repeated measures designs (for example, pain and distress outcomes assessed at various time points); however, in these situations we only included outcomes occurring during the needle procedure (pre-needle outcomes were not included). If outcomes during the needle procedure were not evaluated, we then selected the next proximal time point occurring closest to the completion of the procedure. If outcomes that assessed both during and following the needle-related procedure were reported, outcomes during the needle procedure were selected for inclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>All included RCTs were reviewed to determine if the authors reported any missing data. We had originally proposed that data would not be presented for studies if more than 20% of the originally randomized participants withdrew; however this was not applicable to any of the retrieved studies.</P>
<P>In all situations where data necessary for data pooling were omitted from the published RCT (for example, means, standard deviations (SDs), groups sizes, CIs), attempts were made to contact the study authors to obtain these data. If that was not possible, statistical formulae identified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> for calculating missing data using other reported measures of variation were used (for example, obtaining standard deviations from standard errors, confidence intervals, t values, and P values). In situations in which the authors could not be contacted, did not respond to contact attempts, did not have these data available, or there were insufficient data available to compute the necessary calculations, these studies or the outcomes with the missing data were excluded from this review.</P>
<P>To be consistent with authors&#8217; reporting, we included the number of participants per group identified in the study results sections. When not otherwise specified by the authors, we assumed that there were no study dropouts and used the reported group sizes in the meta-analyses. Initially we intended to conduct all analyses using intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. ITT analyses include all participants enrolled in the study including those who were lost to follow-up or dropped out. Given that the majority of RCTs did not specifically identify whether ITT analyses were used and did not consistently report whether there were any participant dropouts, ITT analyses could not be performed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>For each outcome combining the effects of two or more studies, we calculated heterogeneity using both the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Given that Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests often have low statistical power, a type 1 error level of 0.10 was employed for rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity as opposed to the more traditional type 1 error level of 0.05. While Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests are useful for identifying whether heterogeneity is present, it has been argued that there will always be some level of heterogeneity in meta-analyses given the clinical and methodological diversity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic shifts the focus away from whether heterogeneity is present and provides a measure of inconsistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). I<SUP>2 </SUP>is expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100, and the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> suggests the following rough interpretation guide: 0 to 40%, might not be important; 30% to 60%, may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%, may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% represents considerable heterogeneity. The reason for some of the overlap in ranges is because the importance of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on several other factors such as the magnitude and direction of effects, as well as the strength of evidence for the heterogeneity (for example, the P value for the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test or the confidence interval for the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic). In cases where statistically significant heterogeneity was detected, the data were still pooled; however, these results should be interpreted with caution. Given that there was significant heterogeneity for several of the analyses, results were analysed using a random-effects model. When possible, attempts were made to explore the reasons for the heterogeneity. We chose only to report I<SUP>2 </SUP>values in the text of the results section but both the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistics and Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests are depicted in the forest plot figures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">8. Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>In order to help overcome publication bias in both the original and updated review, we: (1) imposed no language barriers in our search, (2) contacted several list serves and researchers in the field of pediatric health and pain to request any published, unpublished, and in-progress studies, and (3) contacted the authors of all the studies with missing means, standard deviations, and cell sizes in attempts to retrieve these data. Of note, many studies included several outcome measures; however, in some situations authors only reported means and standard deviations when the group differences with respect to the intervention were significant, but not when group differences were not significant. We included any studies in the meta-analysis that provided completed results (that is, means, SDs, and cell sizes for both treatment and control groups) for at least one outcome measure. Information related to reporting biases is also captured in the Risk of bias tool used to code all of the included studies reported in this update (studies included from the original review were also coded for this update using this tool). Nine of the studies included in this review had authors who responded to our requests and provided clarification or missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Balan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Balan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisignano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bisignano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2007</LINK>;

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>SMDs using a random-effects model for each of the above subcategories were calculated when the necessary data were available. Interventions were considered efficacious when the SMD and both anchors of the CI fell in the negative range. In the original review, we limited the main analyses to only RCTs but included quasi-randomized trials in sensitivity analyses. Due to the limitations of quasi-randomized trials, we limited the analyses to only true RCTs for this review update and did not include the additional sensitivity analyses for quasi-randomized trials.</P>
<P>In situations where studies included more than one type of control condition, we selected the condition that was most similar to the intervention condition, with the only difference being non-administration of the specific intervention. Thus, if a study had three conditions comparing: (1) music with headphones, (2) headphones without music, and (3) no headphones or music, we would select the headphones without music condition as the appropriate control condition because it was most similar to the intervention but just did not include the active ingredient (that is, music). In addition, it was important to note that some control or standard care groups included some cognitive or behavioural techniques, or both. However, we decided a priori to continue to classify these as control conditions since they were determined to be part of standard care and were conceptualized as control conditions by the study authors. In addition, and as noted above, if the control condition included a pharmacological component (for example, lidocaine and prilocaine eutectic mixture (EMLA), a cream used for local anaesthesia), this was still conceptualized as a control condition provided that the intervention group also received the same pharmacological component plus a psychological intervention. The implications of these types of control conditions are further explored in the discussion section of this review.</P>
<P>Consistent with the original review, when a single study provided more than one observer rating of the same construct (for example, both parent and nurse VAS ratings of child pain) or more than one behavioural measure for the same construct (for example, CAMPIS and OSBD measures to assess distress), these measures were pooled using statistical formulae recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration for combining means and SDs. This was done in order to be able to summarize the large amount of data reported in these studies. The formulae we used to pool means and SDs were the following: pooled mean = [(mean1 x N1) + (mean2 x N2) / (N1 + N2)] and pooled SD = square root of [SD1<SUP>2</SUP> (N1 - 1) + SD2<SUP>2</SUP> (N2 - 1)] / N1 + N2 -2.</P>
<P>As previously indicated, for studies that included outcomes for numerous time points we restricted our analyses to the measurement occurring during the procedure or, if that was not provided, we used the first post-procedure measurement. For example, if a study included procedural measures (taken during the needle) and post-procedural measures (taken after the needle), we included only the former in our analyses. For studies that included only post-needle measures but provided them at several time points (for example, immediately after needle, one minute later, five minutes later), we included the first measure or the outcome assessed as soon as possible following the needle. Pre-procedural measures of pain or distress were not analysed as the focus of this review was on pain and distress reduction during needle procedures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">10. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>As with the original review, subgroup analyses were limited to analysing each category of psychological intervention separately (for example, distraction RCTs, hypnosis RCTs, etc) as the interventions were considered too qualitatively distinct to combine, and overall analyses including all RCTs would not be as meaningful. In addition, as mentioned above, within each intervention category analyses were broken down by outcome category (pain versus distress outcomes) and within each of those categories they were further broken down by outcome measure (that is, self-report, observer-report, behavioural rating scales, and physiological interventions). Physiological outcomes were further analysed separately as they represented distinct functions or processes (for example, heart rate versus blood pressure). For all outcomes, the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic of heterogeneity were carried out as previously described.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">11. Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In our original review, we were unable to conduct all of the sensitivity analyses that we proposed due to insufficient data reported within and across studies, as well as the small number of studies within each intervention category. The main sensitivity analyses we conducted in the original review involved comparing the study results when quasi-randomized trials were added to the analyses. However, in order to strengthen the methodological quality of the findings for this updated review, we limited the included trials to only true RCTs that explicitly stated that true random assignment was conducted. As a result, the four studies with alternating assignment included in the sensitivity analyses of the original review were omitted from this updated review (<LINK REF="STD-Christiano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Christiano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLaren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacLaren 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manne-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Manne 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sparks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sparks 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Results of the search</HEADING>
<P>Three electronic database searches were conducted: one for the original review (February 2005) and three for the updated review (December 2010, March 2012, March 2013). In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2008</LINK>), 29 papers representing 28 separate studies were included. Of these, four were excluded from this review update because they did not report adequate randomization procedures in the paper (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-1994" TYPE="STUDY">French 1994</LINK>) and three were excluded because they were unpublished dissertation theses (<LINK REF="STD-Krauss-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Krauss 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zabin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Zabin 1982</LINK>). Of note, the Cohen 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2001</LINK>) study was listed in the original review as Cohen 1999 (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>) because both studies reported on the same sample; however, it was only counted as one study. Thus, a total of 21 studies from the original review were included in this update.</P>
<P>We initiated an updated search of the six databases from 2005 (inclusive) onwards in December 2010, yielding a total of 1338 abstracts which were reviewed. To account for the time taken to review these abstracts and work on other components of this review, we also conducted searches of the databases in March 2012 and March 2013 to identify any new studies published since December 2010. These latter two searches yielded an additional 639 abstracts. A total of 1977 abstracts were reviewed for this review update. Of these abstracts, 90 studies were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria; however two of these studies were previously identified and included in our original review (<LINK REF="STD-Liossi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liossi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tak 2006</LINK>) and one study was not identified in the original review search (<LINK REF="STD-Klingman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Klingman 1985</LINK>). Not accounting for the two studies already included in our original review (<LINK REF="STD-Liossi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liossi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tak 2006</LINK>), this resulted in 88 studies identified in these updated searches that were reviewed in full based on their abstracts.</P>
<P>Our original search retrieved one non-English study reported in Portuguese, which was translated into English (<LINK REF="STD-Santos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1999</LINK>). Our updated search retrieved two non-English studies reported in Farsi (<LINK REF="STD-Shahabi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shahabi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosoghi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vosoghi 2010</LINK>), which needed to be reviewed in full. We obtained the assistance of a translator recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration who confirmed that one of these studies met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Vosoghi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vosoghi 2010</LINK>). He then completed the data extraction form and Risk of bias tool for this study. In reviewing this study, he also identified an additional study in Farsi which potentially met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 2005</LINK>). The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahabi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shahabi 2007</LINK>) were excluded because they employed cross-over designs and data were not available pre-crossover, such that the studies could not be assessed as RCTs. In addition, our updated search identified two studies in German (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerbauer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerbauer 2011</LINK>) and two in Italian (<LINK REF="STD-Bufalini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bufalini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lessi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lessi 2011</LINK>), which we had informally reviewed by researchers fluent in these languages; however, none of these studies met our inclusion criteria. One of these studies was excluded because the groups received general anesthesia or conscious sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Bufalini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bufalini 2009</LINK>) and the other three were excluded because they were not true RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerbauer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerbauer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lessi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lessi 2011</LINK>). In total, of the 88 studies identified from these updated searches, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria and provided the data necessary for data pooling.</P>

<P>Of the 39 included studies, most had intervention arms examining distraction only (n = 20), followed by hypnosis (n = 7), CBT-combined (n = 4), parent coaching plus child distraction (n = 3), suggestion only (n = 3), preparation and information (n = 2), virtual reality (n = 2); and memory alteration, parent positioning plus child distraction, blowing out air, and distraction plus suggestion (n = 1 each). Needle procedures varied and included venipuncture (n = 13), IV insertion (n = 7), immunization (n = 6), lumbar puncture (n = 5), bone marrow aspiration (n = 2); and intramuscular injection, local dental anesthetic, injection for allergy testing, laceration repair (n = 1 each). Additionally, participants in one study received either a venipuncture or IV insertion, and in another study they received bone marrow aspiration or lumbar puncture. Included studies also varied significantly in the age of recruited participants. The majority of studies (n = 22) focused on preschool (two to five years old) or school-aged children only (that is, six to 12 years old). Two studies included preschoolers and up to age 13 years. Fourteen studies recruited a wide age range of participants crossing preschool, school age, and adolescence (that is, anywhere from two to 19 years old). Only one study focused exclusively on adolescents (that is, 13 to 15 years old), which examined distraction. Interventions involving parent coaching or parent positioning combined with child distraction generally included preschool or school-aged children only, with the exception of one study which included children and adolescents (that is, 5 to 18 years old). Otherwise, types of interventions examined were distributed across the age ranges. All studies included both boys and girls, with three studies not reporting the sex of participants. Please refer to the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table for additional detail, including the intervention and control conditions for each of these studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Of the 188 studies identified and reviewed in full in the original review, 51 were excluded because they did not meet all of the inclusion criteria or failed to provide the data necessary for data pooling. Furthermore, as noted above, eight papers representing seven studies that were included in the original review were excluded from this review update because they did not report adequate randomization procedures in the paper or they were unpublished dissertation theses (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-1994" TYPE="STUDY">French 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krauss-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Krauss 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zabin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Zabin 1982</LINK>).

<P>All of the 39 studies included in this review were coded using seven &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; categories, which included: 1) random sequence generation (selection bias), 2) allocation concealment (selection bias), 3) incomplete outcome data addressed (attrition bias), 4) free of selective reporting, 5) free of other bias, 6) blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), and 7) blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias). Risk of bias results are depicted in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. For random sequence generation, 15 of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, none were rated as having a high risk of bias, and 24 were rated as unclear. For allocation concealment, two of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, seven were rated as having a high risk of bias, and 30 were rated as unclear. For incomplete outcome data addressed, 30 of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, three were rated as having a high risk of bias, and six were rated as unclear. For free of selective reporting, one of the studies was rated as having a low risk of bias, 16 were rated as having a high risk of bias, and 22 were rated as unclear. For free of other bias, five of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, 21 were rated as having a high risk of bias, and 13 were rated as unclear. For blinding of participants and personnel, none of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, 37 were rated as having a high risk of bias, and two were rated as unclear. This result was expected given that it is not typically feasible to blind participants and personnel when conducting psychological interventions. However, we decided to code this item as we did not want to miss any studies where they may have been able to achieve blinding through creative methodology. For example, in theory, a study could achieve blinding of participants and personnel if the intervention involved parenting coaching or training in the use of distraction whereby participants (children receiving the injection) and personnel (nurses administering the injection) were unaware of the intervention. For blinding of outcome assessment, one of the studies was rated as having a low risk of bias, 36 were rated as having a high risk of bias, and two were rated as unclear. Again, although it is rare and challenging to achieving blinding of outcomes for psychological interventions, it is also possible. For example, if a study assessed an intervention involving nurse coaching or training in the use of distraction whereby parents and children were not made aware that distraction was being used as an intervention, and if the outcomes assessed were only completed by the children and parents, this study would achieve blinding of outcome assessment. Another example could involve a situation in which observer ratings are conducted based on a video recording of the needle procedure where the observer is blind to the intervention used and the type of intervention received is not discernible from the video.</P>
<P>All of the 21 analyses reported below were assessed for heterogeneity. Of these 20 analyses: five had I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 0% suggesting that heterogeneity might not be important; one had an I<SUP>2 </SUP>value below 30%, one had an I<SUP>2</SUP> value between 30% and 50%, which may represent moderate heterogeneity; 11 had I<SUP>2</SUP> values between 50% and 90% inclusive, which may represent substantial heterogeneity; and three had I<SUP>2</SUP> scores above 90%, which indicated considerable heterogeneity.</P>

<P>As with our original review, the most evidence in terms of number of published RCTs existed for the efficacy of distraction on self-reported pain. In total, there were 19 included studies examining the effects of distraction, although one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bellieni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellieni 2006</LINK>) involved two distraction groups using different strategies. The distraction techniques in these studies involved: listening to music (n = 5) (<LINK REF="STD-Balan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Balan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristjansdottir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansdottir 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Press-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Press 2003</LINK>), watching cartoons (n = 4) (<LINK REF="STD-Bellieni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellieni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>), playing with a toy (n = 2) (<LINK REF="STD-Vessey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vessey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosoghi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vosoghi 2010</LINK>), non-procedural talk (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1993</LINK>), squeezing a rubber ball (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2006</LINK>), using cards with questions on them (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Inal-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Inal 2012</LINK>), listening via earphones to stories being sung or read (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Noguchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noguchi 2006</LINK>), mother distraction including speaking, caressing, and soothing (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Bellieni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellieni 2006</LINK>), or a combination or selection of various distractors such as toys, books, cartoons, games, or music (n = 4) (<LINK REF="STD-Fanurik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fanurik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuttner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kuttner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2006</LINK>). Thus, distraction interventions varied widely regarding the degree of passive or active involvement of the child, parental, or health professional involvement, or opportunity for the child to choose a distractor. Of these 19 studies examining distraction, the needle procedures included venipuncture or blood draw only (n = 8) (<LINK REF="STD-Balan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Balan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bellieni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellieni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inal-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Inal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Press-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Press 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vessey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vessey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>), immunization or injection (n = 4) (<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristjansdottir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansdottir 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noguchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noguchi 2006</LINK>), IV insertion (n = 2) (<LINK REF="STD-Fanurik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fanurik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosoghi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vosoghi 2010</LINK>), laceration repair (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2006</LINK>), venipuncture via venous cannulation (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2006</LINK>), allergy testing involving injection (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2007</LINK>), bone marrow aspiration (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Kuttner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kuttner 1987</LINK>), and lumbar puncture (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2010</LINK>). Although the age ranges across the studies were quite broad and varied considerably, all of the studies included children 12 years and younger as part of the sample with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansdottir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansdottir 2010</LINK>), which only examined adolescents aged between 13 and 15 years. Of the remaining 18 studies that included children 12 and under, five of these also included adolescents aged up to 18 years (<LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanurik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fanurik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Press-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Press 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2006</LINK>) while five studies only included children seven years and younger (<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuttner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kuttner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noguchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noguchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosoghi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vosoghi 2010</LINK>). The variance in age ranges between and within studies and variability in type of needle procedures limits our ability to make age- or procedure-specific conclusions or recommendations.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results  </HEADING>
<P>This review synthesizes the results of 39 RCTs; 21 identified from the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2006</LINK>) and an additional 18 identified from this update. By including only true randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals, this review offers a rigorous systematic examination of the efficacy of psychological interventions for reducing needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents. Our results show strong evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis. More specifically, trials support the use of distraction for reducing pain, and hypnosis for the reduction of both pain and distress. Despite the availability of two to four RCTs for each type of intervention, no evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress. Our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2006</LINK>) identified sufficient evidence supporting combined CBT; however, due to the more stringent inclusion criteria of this update, three trials examining combined CBT were removed (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 1998</LINK>) and two new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisignano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bisignano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>) were identified in the updated searches. Given this new evidence, the efficacy of combined CBT was no longer supported. No conclusions could be made about the efficacy of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion due to the availability of single trials only in those areas.</P>
<P>Although this review continues to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction as a whole, significantly variability was noted in the distraction methods described in the 20 trials reporting on distraction interventions. We are still lacking clear evidence to identify whether the type of distraction influences its efficacy across child development, and with different needle procedures. Although the type of distraction varies, the majority of the evidence for distraction to date is with school-aged children (that is, ages six to 12 years), but it is supported by studies including children from two to 19 years old. Future studies clarifying these distinctions are necessary to empirically inform more targeted analyses and treatment recommendations.</P>
<P>Overall, hypnosis had the largest effect sizes for reducing pain and distress during needle-related procedures; however, it is important to note that the majority of these trials have been published by the same research group. As such, this raises questions about the generalizability and efficacy of this approach when administered by different providers in different pediatric settings. Future research should assess the efficacy of hypnosis in different settings, including multi-site trials with multiple therapists, in order to provide additional support for the generalizability of these intervention approaches. Furthermore, hypnotisability appears related to the magnitude of treatment benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Liossi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liossi 2003</LINK>). Therefore, hypnosis may not be effective for children who have low hypnotisability. This highlights the important point of needing to not only examine intervention efficacy overall but also to consider and evaluate the match between intervention type and child characteristics.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence  </HEADING>
<P>This review enables identification of current trends in pediatric acute pain research. Since the publication of the original review, we have noted a decrease in use of classic no-treatment control groups, defined as the absence of psychological and pharmacological pain management, as well as the increased use of topical anesthetics as part of standard care. This is likely due, in part, to the dissemination of advances in pediatric pain management through publication and endorsement of clinical practice guidelines and position statements (<LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2010</LINK>). Indeed, withholding topical anesthetics and non-pharmacological intervention in the face of a strong evidence base for their effectiveness is widely and accurately justified as unethical (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Medical-Association-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Medical Association 2008</LINK>). However, this shift also has practical research implications. Comparison of interventions with other effective treatments will make it more difficult to detect treatment effects; as such, the field may need to apply new parameters in determining the degree of treatment efficacy (for example, non-inferiority trials). Furthermore, the use of topical anesthetics needs to be measured and controlled for in future trials as their use in standard care may vary, and they are not uniformly given to all children (<LINK REF="STD-Windich_x002d_Biermeier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Windich-Biermeier 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wint-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wint 2002</LINK>), thereby potentially contaminating the group of additional psychological interventions. While the decreased use of no-treatment control groups and increased use of topical anesthetics may reflect a trend towards increased use of evidence-based strategies, continued suboptimal acute pain assessment and management (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2009</LINK>) suggests that this knowledge is not being widely translated into implementation by providers and families. While the results of this review provide information about research trends, it may not accurately represent what it being implemented in actual clinical practice around the world.</P>
<P>Although the results of this review are based on 39 trials, the vast majority of studies continue to investigate the efficacy of distraction. Rather than continuing to examine a mix of distractors, we argue that the field would benefit more from studies systematically comparing and dismantling the effective aspects of distraction techniques. For example, more recent trials have begun distinguishing between &#8216;active&#8217; distraction, which engages more senses and requires more patient engagement (for example, playing a video game) versus 'passive' distraction where the patient is less actively involved (for example, watching television (TV)). This warrants further investigation as experimental research has shown that active or interactive (as compared to passive) virtual-reality based distraction was more efficacious for reducing pain in children (<LINK REF="REF-Dalhquist-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalhquist 2007</LINK>). However, a systematic review of music therapy for painful medical procedures in children found that passive music therapy was as effective as active music therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Klassen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 2008</LINK>). Research is also needed to identify the impact of distraction novelty on intervention efficacy as it has been proposed that interventions involving novel materials or activities are more effective at capturing a child&#8217;s attention (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slifer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slifer 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the role of child preference or choice in distractors is also of interest given that older and younger children tend to select different distractors when given the choice (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windich_x002d_Biermeier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Windich-Biermeier 2007</LINK>). A number of included trials involved parents in the distraction intervention (; <LINK REF="STD-Bellieni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellieni 2006</LINK>

; 
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>). Future research should consider the potential impact of parental involvement on intervention delivery and efficacy, as parental presence alone is known to influence children&#8217;s behaviour during painful experiences regardless of parent behaviour (see <LINK REF="REF-Vervoort-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vervoort 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vervoort-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vervoort 2011</LINK>). Thus, although we can conclude overall that distraction is efficacious for reducing needle-related pain, our ability to differentiate which aspects of distraction are most efficacious remains limited.</P>
<P>Actual engagement of the parent or child, or both, in the distraction activity should also be routinely monitored in RCTs, as the effectiveness of a particular distractor may depend on the level of engagement or dose received. McCarthy and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 2010</LINK>) noted that some parents in their control group engaged naturally in distraction. In order to best identify the impact of distraction on needle-related pain and distress, they created three comparison groups based on the actual level of observed parent distraction during the intravenous line (IV) insertion, regardless of experimental group. This secondary analysis provided a more rigorous test of the impact that distraction had on child pain. While child engagement and successful use of distraction techniques are critical for making conclusions about efficacy, very few studies routinely assess and control for this important confounder.</P>
<P>Importantly, the age range of children included in the trials in this review varied greatly, making it difficult to determine which psychological interventions are most effective for different age ranges or developmental periods. Furthermore, few studies exclusively examined interventions in adolescents. Given the rapid developmental changes that take place from early childhood to late adolescence, it is likely that the efficacy of interventions vary based on developmental stage and maturity of the individual child. Indeed, self-management of needle-related pain and distress using evidence-based psychological interventions may be particularly important for older children and adolescents when immunizations are often given in school settings; reliance on parents decreases throughout development and the children increasingly rely on cognitive coping strategies. For example, children&#8217;s inclination towards the use of particular coping strategies changes across development, with research indicating that younger children tend to use more behavioural strategies, whereas older children and adolescents use more cognitive strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Skinner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 2007</LINK>). Future research should assess the relative efficacy of psychological interventions across development in order to inform treatment that matches and bolsters their effectiveness.</P>
<P>There was notable variability in the types of needle procedures represented in this review, including those that are expected to occur multiple times even among healthy children, such as immunizations. However, very few trials assessed the efficacy of psychological interventions over time and the maintenance of treatment gains. One notable exception was the work of Liossi and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Liossi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liossi 2009</LINK>), who examined children&#8217;s use of hypnosis over the course of three needle-related procedures. In addition to examining change over time, the researchers examined pain and distress among children while they received therapist-guided hypnosis at an initial procedure and then again while they engaged in self-hypnosis during two subsequent procedures. This study highlights the importance of examining changes and maintenance of treatment gains within children over time, as well as the generalizability of interventions beyond individual providers.</P>
<P>Lastly, in addition to direct outcomes such as quantifications of pain and distress, it is also important to consider other relevant but indirect evidence. For example, it would be helpful for studies to assess child, caregiver, and health professional preference or beliefs about different intervention techniques, changes over time in the adoption of pain reduction and prevention strategies, data on needle pain prevention and relief in adult or animal studies, and expert opinions. Currently the Canadian Task on Preventative Care classifies the opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience as level III (lowest rating) in terms of criteria for evaluating evidence, while evidence from RCTs is rated as level I (the highest rating) (<LINK REF="REF-Palda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palda 2004</LINK>). Additional evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for reducing childhood vaccination pain are also available and should be considered when conducting future studies in the area of acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence  </HEADING>
<P>To our knowledge, this review represents the largest and most up to date review of psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents, and includes a total of 39 RCTs comprising 3394 participants. The evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for reducing children&#8217;s pain and distress is consistent across relevant included trials. Although the quality of evidence is limited by the many studies with high or unclear risk of bias for their outcomes, the 39 RCTs included in this review can be considered the most rigorous and well-reported studies in the field. An additional 128 studies were excluded due to insufficient rigour or inadequate reporting of findings for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Assessment of risk of bias in trial design and reporting is critical as RCTs with unclear or high risk of bias have been associated with significantly larger treatment effects in RCTs with children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Hartling-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartling 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>). Addressing incomplete outcome data was the domain with the greatest proportion of studies categorized as low risk of bias, although all trials showed the majority of bias domains as high or unclear risk. In particular, high risk of bias was most commonly found for blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment. While there are few studies of psychological interventions where it is possible to blind study participants and personnel to the treatment condition, two of the included studies in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Goodenough-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Goodenough 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 2010</LINK>) successfully blinded the observation coding of outcomes. Thus, while complete blinding of the patient or treatment administrator may not be feasible, we argue that researchers should use blind outcome coding whenever possible to reduce study bias, and that this can sometimes be achieved through careful study design.</P>
<P>Many trials had unclear risk of bias, particularly in the domains of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting. While this may expose real limitations in study design, it may alternatively reflect insufficient reporting of study methods and procedures in published manuscripts. However, exaggerated treatment effects have been shown in trials with inadequate or unclear random sequence generation, allocation concealment, or selective reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>). This suggests that researchers should pay careful attention to these domains in study design and publication. Reporting of adequate sequence generation is the only risk of bias domain with notable improvement over the past 30 years of published RCTs in this area. Researchers should carefully follow the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) when reporting randomized trials to ensure that details relevant to randomization, allocation, and blinding are adequately addressed.</P>
<P>Over half of the included trials had a high risk of other sources of bias. Potential sources of bias captured in this domain included concerns regarding the validity or reliability of measurement tools used to assess the outcomes of pain and distress as well as how and when outcomes were assessed (for example, using an unvalidated modification of a validated pain assessment tool). Other notable sources of potential bias included potential contamination of the control or experimental group (for example, venepunctures occurring in a group context and potential for distress contagion), baseline differences between groups, and small sample size resulting in the trial being underpowered to detect group differences. It is perhaps surprising that these issues continue to be quite common as their potential to lead to inaccurate estimates of treatment effects has been noted for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1994</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process  </HEADING>
<P>Strengths of this review include the comprehensive and updated literature searches, the inclusion of non-English publications, and contacting authors when relevant data were missing from published reports. Despite these efforts, 21 studies were excluded solely because they did not provide sufficient data in published reports or via e-mail correspondence to allow for data 
pooling in the meta-analysis. This represents a source of bias as it resulted in a large number of RCTs that could not be adequately captured in our review. In order to limit the exclusion of trials, we included RCTs that provided full data for at least one outcome measure. However, this may pose an additional source of bias given that significant findings are sometimes more fully reported than non-significant findings. To minimize this, authors should include summary statistics (that is, means, SDs, cell sizes) for all assessed outcomes, regardless of study results. In keeping with other recently published Cochrane reviews and updates (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Eccleston-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccleston 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012a</LINK>), we excluded unpublished dissertation studies. This may introduce bias by excluding some relevant studies and we recommend that dissertation authors submit their research to scientific journals to make their findings more accessible and ultimately help translate their research into practice.</P>
<P>Lastly, the timing of assessed pain and distress often varied across studies, sometimes assessed during the needle procedure while in other instances assessed at varying times post-procedure. In some cases, the timing of assessed pain and distress was not clearly reported. This variability in outcome assessments adds potential bias in comparisons across studies. We recommend the standard assessment of post-needle pain or distress immediately following the procedure (that is, as soon as the needle is removed). If studies wish to include additional post-needle measures, it would be helpful to consider establishing a maximum time gap between completion of the needle procedure and measurement of the outcome in order to reduce possible memory-based biases (<LINK REF="REF-Noel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noel 2012</LINK>).</P>

However, other systematic reviews in related areas are available, which also support the efficacy of various psychological or non-pharmacological interventions for pediatric pain management. These include, and are not limited to, systematic reviews of psychological interventions for reducing the pain and distress of childhood immunizations (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2009</LINK>), non-pharmacological interventions for infant procedural pain (<LINK REF="REF-Pillai_x002d_Riddell-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai-Riddell 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pillai_x002d_Riddell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai-Riddell 2011b</LINK>), music interventions for acute and chronic pain in children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klassen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 2008</LINK>), psychological interventions for chronic or recurrent pain in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Eccleston-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccleston 2009</LINK>), and psychological therapies for sickle cell disease and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Anie-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anie 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review suggest that youth, caregivers, and healthcare practitioners should use distraction techniques or hypnosis during needle procedures. Despite the significant variability in distraction interventions (for example, type of distractor, passive or active involvement of the child, and parent or nurse involvement), support is consistent for its efficacy in reducing pain from needle-related procedures. The most evidence is available for more common needle procedures (for example, venepuncture, immunization) and with children 12 years and younger, although support also exists for its use with adolescents. Hypnosis can be particularly helpful for more invasive needle procedures (for example, lumbar punctures) and for reducing both pain and distress; however, its application may be limited in practice given the reduced availability of health professionals trained in hypnosis. In addition to their efficacy in reducing pain and distress, these psychological interventions can also help empower children, adolescents, and their parents in being active agents in their own pain management, thereby facilitating generalizability across settings and time.</P>
<P>At present there is no evidence for the efficacy of any other psychological intervention, including preparation and information, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality, although more trials are needed. No conclusions could be made about additional interventions, such as memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as only one study examined each of these interventions. Of these interventions, it is likely that those including distraction would be most helpful (that is, parent coaching plus distraction, parent positioning plus distraction, and distraction plus suggestion).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(1) Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>It is our position that additional RCTs examining the effectiveness of distraction to a no-treatment or standard care control have limited value. Given the variety of distraction interventions described in the included studies, further research on distraction should compare different types of distractors (for example, active versus passive) and assess the developmental appropriateness of interventions, engagement and dose of the intervention, the impact of novelty, or distractor preference and selection. Despite the myriad of trials examining distraction, this review also identified a variety of psychological interventions that have been examined in only one or two RCTs to date. Several of these suggest promise (for example, preparation and information, blowing out air, distraction plus suggestion) with significant reductions in pain or distress, or both, in single trials; however, conclusions about their efficacy cannot be made at this time given the limited evidence available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2) Consideration of child age and development</HEADING>
<P>There is a gap in our understanding of the efficacy of interventions across age ranges. Future trials should investigate potential age and developmental differences, following the standard age ranges provided by the Standards for Research (StaR) in Child Health initiative (toddlers and preschoolers two to four years, grade-schoolers five to 12 years, adolescents 13 to 19 years (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012b</LINK>)). Furthermore, given the limited evidence specific to adolescents, it is critical for future trials to target that population given that children's coping preferences change across development (<LINK REF="REF-Skinner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 2007</LINK>) as does parental involvement, and needle procedures such as immunizations may occur in a variety of settings (for example, school-based immunization clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansdottir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansdottir 2010</LINK>)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(3) Consideration of variability in needle procedures</HEADING>
<P>Future trials should address our limited understanding regarding the efficacy of interventions for different needle procedures, particularly those that are more routine (for example, immunization, venepuncture) versus those that are considered more invasive (for example, lumbar puncture, bone marrow aspiration), as well as single event versus repeated or multiple needle procedures. In addition, it will be important to assess pain and distress scores at different stages of the procedure (for example, pre-procedure, during procedure, post-procedure, and at subsequent future procedures) to assess longer-term outcomes and to determine whether additional practice and exposure to psychological interventions lead to more optimal pain management.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(4) Improving trial quality and reporting</HEADING>
<P>Although our research suggests that study quality and reporting have improved over time (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2010</LINK>), there remains substantial room for improvement as evidenced by the risk of bias scores reported in this review. Specifically, researchers should ensure true randomization procedures (for example, computer-generated random numbers) and concealment of random allocation, optimize blinding of study outcomes to the extent that is possible (for example, blind coders coding from videotapes), and ensuring adequate sample size for sufficient power to detect group differences. These details should be clearly reported in publications, in addition to thorough reporting of all outcomes and reasons for any withdrawals and dropouts. When selecting outcome measures, researchers should draw from efforts to standardize the use of the highest quality assessment tools, such as the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (PedIMMPACT) (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. CD-ROM Intervention (n=14): CD Rom available free of charge from Starlight Starbright to children, families, and health professionals as part of the STARBRIGHT ExplorerSeries (http://www.starlight.org). The CD-ROM was designed to help children learn about the medical procedure. Children in the intervention condition had approximately 20 min to interact with the CD-ROM. Spotlight on IVs is an interactive CD-ROM that consists of four components: education/information, pre-procedural preparation (video modelling), breathing exercises, and distracting imagery. In the education/information section, the CD-ROM allows children to ask questions such as &#8220;What is an IV?&#8221; and &#8220;How does an IV work?&#8221; using an animated nurse character named Ima Helpa. In addition, children are educated on IV procedural terms. During pre-procedural preparation, children are given a choice of viewing two videos on IV procedure. The first demonstrates a young girl being given an IV by a nurse, and the second uses a young boy to demonstrate how to get around with an IV attachment. In the breathing exercises section, the children are taught simple breathing exercises by Ima Helpa. Children are instructed to take a deep breath and to let it out slowly. For imagery, children are taught a simple imagery technique focusing on a calming location. This may serve two purposes, distraction and relaxation. In addition to Spotlight on IVs, a second CD-ROM, Spotlight on IV Catheters, developed by the first author, was utilized. This CD-ROM focused on the particular IV procedures used with some of the children (i.e., Broviac, Port-a-cath), because Spotlight on IVs does not provide images of these procedures. Haematology&#8211;oncology paediatric patients encounter various types of IVs, including Hickman, Broviac, Port-a-cath, and PICC. Spotlight on IV Catheters contains information and images specific to all three kinds of IVs, whereas Spotlight on IVs only demonstrates PICCs. Like Spotlight on IVs, Spotlight on IV Catheters is colourful and appropriate for children ages 7 to 18. Children in the treatment group viewed both CD-ROMs.<BR/>2. Standard Medical Care Condition (n=16): Children received the routine hospital preparation for the IV procedure. This preparation included an explanation of the IV procedure and explanation of the topical anesthetic cream (EMLA) approximately 1 hr prior to the IV procedure.</P>

<P>1. Distraction + Coping Skills Training + use of a party blower as an age appropriate version of deep breathing (n = 30): Activities the children would engage in prior to the procedures included coloring, playing with toys/puzzles, or interactive reading of a book. Coping skills training involved providing parents with a rationale for the training and instructing them to coach their child to blow a party blower immediately prior to and during the injections. The use of these components was modelled for the parents and children by assistants assuming the roles of nurse, child, and parent. The parent then practised the coaching in a role-play with the assistant using a pretend needle, and was given feedback and praise. Children were allowed to play with the toys and blowers, and were encouraged to watch the training. One role-play was attempted with the child. The total training session took 10-12 minutes.</P>
<P>2. No-Treatment Control (n = 30): Control condition parents were asked to provide demographic information and rate their child's fear and how much they expected to be able to help their child during the medical procedures. Children were asked to provide ratings of their fear using a faces scale. The control subjects waited until called for their immunization, while the treatment subjects completed the demographic questionnaire and underwent the coping skills training prior to completing the other pre-injection inventories.</P>

<P>1. Music Distraction (n = 54): Children received live music intervention before, during, and after blood sampling. The same two musicians participated in the entire study. One of the two musicians met the child and the parent in the waiting room. He started playing, singing, and proposing sonorous objects to the child and the parents and invited everybody to join the performance: the musician&#8217;s aim was to create a relationship with the child and the parents. The musician then asked whether the child would be happy to have him in the procedure room, and if the child agreed, he went in and continued playing and singing while the procedure was going on. After the procedure was finished, he went back to the waiting room together with the child and the parent, always interacting and playing music with them.

<P>1. Parental Positioning + Distraction (n = 20): In addition to receiving standard care, the parents in this group were taught by a child life specialist, using a standard script, how to position and distract their child during venepuncture. The two types of positioning included side-sitting (parent sat in chair next to exam table and child sat sideways on his/her lap) or chest-to-chest sitting (parent sat in chair next to exam table and child sat on his/her lap chest-to-chest). The parent and patient decided which of the two types of positioning to use based on age and size of the patient and parent. In addition, all patients in the experimental group chose from one of three distraction items to use during the procedure. These included the Illusion Kaleidoscope (glitter suspended in a fluid-filled tube passes before the lens when held to the eye and requires no manipulation to change images), I Spy: Super Challenger book (child asked to find items hidden on the page among multiple graphic designs) or Thomas the Tank Engine's Big Lift-and-Look Book (child encouraged to open flaps to find hidden items). Following parental positioning, parents were instructed to engage their child with the distraction by asking the child repeated questions about the activity and reminding them to concentrate on what they were saying and what they were asking the child (e.g., "Look at the colors in the Kaleidoscope. Tell me what you see").</P>

<P>1. Brief Alteration of Memory Intervention (n = 25): Treatment was conducted at two time points: immediately following the first LP and before the second LP. Parents were allowed to be present but did not actively participate. Children's memories of the most recent LP were elicited through a memory interview that tested for biases in recall of threatening details, anxiety, and pain. In conducting the intervention, the therapist encouraged children to (a) reevaluate their reactions to the last LP through enhancing their beliefs about the efficacy of their own coping strategies (e.g., reminding them how asking the physician assistant questions helped them), (b) realistically appraise their responses to the LP (e.g., assessing the extent to which they cried, screamed, or protested), and (c) increase the accuracy of their subjective memory. The therapist and child discussed specific differences between the child's memories and observed behaviours or the child's previous self-report. Children were not taught coping skills but were encouraged to remember successful coping attempts that they naturally had made. To remind them about the intervention techniques during subsequent procedures, children were offered a fluorescent card that contained a cartoon drawing of a child thinking about his or her LP experience. Children wrote down memories discussed during the intervention on the card and then took the card into the procedure room. This card was intended to trigger thinking about the intervention in the absence of the therapist (during future LPs).</P>
<P>2. Attentional Control (n = 25): Children spent the same amount of time with the therapist as did the treatment group, both after the first and second LP, but were engaged in non-procedure related activities (e.g., drawing). Children in both groups were offered support and encouragement by the nurse and physician assistant during LPs and received preparation from the child life staff, including information and demonstration with dolls. However, children in the attention control group did not have a card to take with them during the LPs.</P>

<P>1. Virtual Reality (VR) Distraction (n= 10): This intervention involved a VR distraction presented via a head-mounted display. The virtual environment (VE), <I>Street Luge, </I>by Fifth Dimension Technologies (5DT), featured a fast-moving reality-based world in which the player races downhill lying on top of a big skateboard. The VE was presented via the 5DT HMD 800, a high-performance professional HMD that provides active matrix LCDs with full SVGA (800 _ 600 _ 3 [rgb]) pixel resolution. An InterSense Inertia Cube2 with a 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) tracker was attached. The player navigated through the VE with a Logitech rumble pad that provided tactile feedback and music via headphones, thus supplying a multi-sensory immersive experience. The HMD was connected to a Dell laptop (&lt;www.dell.com&gt;), Inspiron 8500 with 2.6-GHz processing speed and 1 GB of RAM, operating on Microsoft Windows XP and a NVIDIA GeForce4 4200 Go video card. Children in this treatment group received the VR intervention plus standard care. They began interacting with the VE 5 minutes prior to the IV placement, continued play throughout, and interacted with the VR for 5 subsequent minutes.</P>
<P>2. Standard Care (n= 10): Topical anesthesia spray prior to IV placement, with no distraction. Children in this control group received only standard care and no VR. They were given an opportunity to play with the VR for</P>

The story offered a simple description of the venous blood sampling procedure, why it is carried out, and what happens to the blood after it has been collected. It emphasized that the procedure creates a brief period of pain, and that the pain is noticeable but not unbearable. The story also stressed that venepuncture is less painful if a child relaxes his arm and cooperates with the technician. In order to increase the likelihood of children modeling the behaviour of the child featured in the story, sex- and age-appropriate models of average appearance were used, and local children, parents, and hospital settings were photographed.</P>

<P>1. Hypnosis Intervention (n = 14, + 1 excluded from analyses): Hypnosis was performed following the usual three-step Ericksonian procedure. Hypnotic induction began once the subject was seated in the dentist&#8217;s chair. Speaking slowly in a monotone voice, the hypnotherapist made the child focus on her (hypnotherapist) voice and on images to establish a &#8220;hypnotic relation&#8221;, first taking into account items in the room and then using suggestions and stories. The suggestions or stories used during the induction were linked with things the child was interested in and were chosen according to the initial interview. The child could express any discomfort using a predefined code. All external interventions (e.g., examination with the mirror, placement of towels, injection) were carried out with agreement of the hypnotherapist, who incorporated these interventions in her explanations to the child. A hypnotic trance was considered to have been achieved when the hypnotherapist noted muscular relaxation, regular breathing, and immobility (cataleptic state). The dental anesthesia and treatments were then performed. The hypnotherapist continued speaking to the child to maintain the state of trance. At the end of the treatment session, the hypnotherapist gradually &#8220;awoke&#8221; the child by speaking a little bit louder and using the items in the room to help the child come back to the initial conscious state. The hypnosis was performed by a single trained operator.</P>

<P>1. Hypnosis (n = 18): Comprised training in hypnosis and self-hypnosis by one of two psychologists experienced in psychological aspects of oncology and hypnosis. Major components of this intervention included the development of rapport, direct discussions about the child&#8217;s medical history and treatment needs, a hypnotic induction utilizing eye fixation with or without eye closure, active imagery tailored to the interests of each individual child, deep muscle relaxation, and suggestions. The specific suggestions incorporated were as follows: imagery to reduce or reframe sensory/pain experiences; distraction and relaxation; pairing positive affect with medical procedures; developing a sense of mastery and control over sensory and affective experience; and post-hypnotic suggestions for practicing and re-entering hypnosis with a cue from their therapist during actual procedures.</P>
<P>2. Play control condition (n = 18): This condition was comprised of non-directed play sessions designed to control for the amount of time and attention the child received from a sympathetic hospital professional (i.e., the psychologists performing the interventions). Subjects in this condition were seen prior to BMAs for the same amount of time as those in the hypnosis condition and by the same psychologists. Elements of the non-directed play condition included development of rapport, non-medical play, and no-medical verbal interactions.

<P>1. Parent Coaching + Distraction (n = 22): Parents viewed a 7-minute educational video on distraction that was developed for this study (available from authors upon request). The children remained with their parents during the video, and were encouraged to watch it. The narration tells the viewer why and how distraction should be used with children. The viewer is given suggestions on how to choose the most effective distraction strategy. Three parents model distraction with their preschool aged children and explain why they found distraction to be helpful. Finally, parents are told to involve the child in choosing the distraction and to praise the child at the end of the procedure. The video ends with a written summary of the following key points: (a) Focus your child&#8217;s attention away from the medical procedure, (b) use activities that keep your child&#8217;s attention (interactive books, blowing bubbles, surprise or novel toys, favourite stories), (c) if you lose your child&#8217;s attention, keep trying to get it back, (d) using distraction takes some effort, but it can help you child feel more comfortable, and (e) praise your child at the e4nd of the procedure. After viewing the video, the parents and children were shown a basket of distraction items and were encouraged to pick something to use during the IV insertion.</P>

<P>1. Music Distraction with Headphones (n = 38): Participants were asked to wear headphones to listen to music.</P>
<P>2. Music Distraction without Headphones (n = 41): Participants were not asked to wear headphones to listen to music. Instead, they were asked to listen to music from loudspeakers.</P>
<P>In designing the intervention, therapeutic nursing intervention guidelines on distraction to relieve pain and music therapy were used. In addition, a music therapist was consulted. The intervention protocol was the same for both intervention groups and included the following: (a) explaining the purpose of the music to the adolescents (i.e., to distract and to help them cope during/after the immunization), (b) asking them to concentrate on and &#8216;disappear into&#8217; the music, and continue to do so for a few minutes (2&#8211;3 minutes) before and after the immunization, and (c) creating a sense of control in the adolescents by giving them choice (i.e., selecting a CD and controlling the volume setting). The music for the study was selected based upon results from a pilot study. Using a hypothetical immunization, 6 teens (13&#8211;15 years old) were interviewed showing they preferred top ten chart music to relaxing music during the immunization. Acknowledging this, the music used in the study was largely chosen from top 10 charts of the day, with the exception of one relaxing classical CD. In selecting the top ten chart music for the study, advice from a music marketing manager who knew adolescent music preferences, was sought.</P>
<P>3. Standard Care Control (n = 39): The school nurses were encouraged to maintain their normal modes of caring, which was to comfort and guide the adolescents verbally. If the adolescents had any questions or concerns prior to the immunization, or discomfort after the immunization, the school nurses responded to these with care.</P>

<P>1. Hypnosis (n = 9): This group received the hypnotic techniques in which the child&#8217;s favourite story became the hypnotic vehicle to create a pleasant imaginative involvement that would lead to a different interpretation of the noxious experience. The favourite stories included hypnotic suggestions and reframing. Prior to the medical procedure, the researcher asked the child to tell his/her favourite story, noted the child&#8217;s choice of words and emphasis, and then suggested the following plan of action: &#8216;When we go into the treatment room, how would it be if I tell the story of (insert child&#8217;s story title) while the BMA gets done? I wouldn't be surprised if the procedure didn't go much quicker, and by the time the story ends the band-aid will be on and everything will be finished!&#8217; After a 10-20 minute induction and practice session, the researcher accompanied the child and parent into the surgery room where, as soon as the child was lying on the table, a trance was induced and maintained through the procedure. The hypnotic process incorporated active involvement with the child, flexibility, informality, and narrowed/increase absorption of attention. Procedural and sensory information was interwoven into the story-line (e.g., indirect/direct suggestions for comfort, diminishing pain awareness, and increased coping within the story-line). The central characters and heroes/heroines were used as metaphors of courage and feelings of accomplishment. Parents were encouraged to be present and touch or hold the child&#8217;s hand; however, the therapist was generally the only adult to talk with the child during the procedure.</P>
<P>2. Distraction (n = 8): Physical objects such as pop-up books, bubbles, and squeezy toys were used during the BMA to shift the child's attention away from the painful procedure and onto these physical objects which contained elements of surprise, play, and opportunities for the child to demonstrate some accomplishment, instead of feeling helpless. For example, the child was encouraged to count interesting objects in the pop-up book, or to blow bubbles, or was challenged to correctly name physical objects.<BR/>

<P>Although it was not stated in the paper, personal communication with author confirmed that randomization was achieved via a random table of numbers. Also, the authors note that verbal communication from therapist to child during the procedure comprised brief encouragements (e.g., &#8220;You&#8217;re doing fine&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s almost over&#8221;) and were the same for patients in all the groups. While the authors conceptualized these statements as &#8216;encouragement&#8217;, other research literature would categorize these statements as &#8216;reassurance&#8217; which has been shown to be a distress-promoting strategy. However, although this could potentially reduce the efficacy of the interventions, since all three conditions received these statements, this would not present as a confound and comparisons between groups are still feasible. Lastly, outcomes were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. For this review, only post-treatment scores were used. </P>

<P>1. Musical Story Distraction (n = 21): A focus of attention task was designed around a musical recording for children entitled &#8216;Little Squirrel&#8217;, which contained lyrics that told a story about a little squirrel and the things he did one day. The song was performed by a male vocalist and included an instrumental accompaniment.</P>
<P>2. Non-Music/Spoken Story Distraction (n = 21): The non-music/spoken version of the same story was recited at the same tempo by a male volunteer.</P>
<P>Both stories (music and spoken) were recorded onto a CD-R. These selections, each 1 minute and 56 seconds in duration, were presented to the participants via a portable CD player and headphones. For the purpose of infection control, the headphones were wrapped with fresh pieces of plastic wrap each time they were used by a participant. Visual aids depicting events and characters in the story were created using clip art. There were five event visuals: squirrel shaking tail, squirrel wiggling nose, squirrel digging a hole, squirrel cracking a nut, and squirrel taking a nap. There were also five animal character visuals: mouse, owl, rabbit, bee, and dog. Velcro backings were placed on the ten laminated visuals, and were presented to the participants on a Velcro board. The child was told by the examiner that he/she would be listening to a &#8220;story about a little squirrel who did many things and saw many animals while he was running around&#8221;. The experimenter then labeled the squirrel action visuals one at a time, stating what action was taking place (e.g., &#8216;he shook his tail&#8217;) and pointing at the corresponding picture on the Velcro board. The experimenter asked the child to state what was happening in each picture. In situations when the child did not state the action, the experimenter asked a yes/no question (e.g., &#8216;Is he wiggling his nose in this picture?&#8217;) and restated what action was taking place. The animal visuals were presented in a similar manner. Children were told to listen carefully to the story because they would need to point to the various pictures to answer questions about the story. If the child became distracted from the task by the injection process, the experimenter attempted to redirect the child to the activity by using phrases such as &#8220;keep pointing&#8221; and &#8220;look at the pictures&#8221;. In instances when the injection procedure lasted longer than the CD recording, the recording was replayed. The child was reinforced by the examiner throughout the procedure for pointing behaviours (e.g., &#8220;Good pointing&#8221;) and provided with reassurance (e.g., &#8220;It&#8217;s almost done. You&#8217;re doing a good job&#8221;) as warranted.</P>

<P>1. Parent Coaching + Child Distraction (n = 22): In addition to standard care, the intervention group also used a self-selected distracter. Participants chose one from a pool of five distracters including: (a) the I Spy Super Challenger book where parents asked their child to look for hidden pictures or items on the page among various graphic designs, (b) bubbles (parents below bubbles using a magic wand, (c) music table (vibroacoustic music felt through speakers built into the mattress of the procedure table; sound is heard via speakers and also channeled through headphones; children selected a 45-minute music CD of music from Radio Disney-Kid Jams and other children&#8217;s classics), (d) Virtual Reality glasses (similar to oversized sunglasses with attached earphones, showing a 3D video with stereo-sound music), and (e) Nintendo Gameboy (handles gaming device with colour screen displaying fast-moving action packed games with sound effects). After the participant selected a distracter, the parent was instructed by one of the co-investigators using a standardized script, to actively coach the child to use the distraction item. During the procedure, the participants were repeatedly encouraged by their parents to focus all of their attention on the distracter instead of the procedure. Just prior to beginning the procedure and during the procedure, the parent provided constant and repeated verbal distraction cues to the patient (e.g., &#8220;Help me find the rabbits on this page&#8221;, &#8220;Can you count the number of bubbles in the air?&#8221;, etc).</P>
<P>2. Standard Care (n = 28): The comparison group received standard care including: (a) a full explanation of the procedure given to the participant and parent, (b) parental presence at the participant&#8217;s side during the procedure for support, and (c) use of a topical anesthetic over the needle puncture site (either EMLA or Fluori-Methane, depending on participant/parent preference), which is the standard practice for all non-emergent needle stick procedures).</P>

<P>Data for parent-reported fear, nurse-reported fear, and OBSD broken down by group (intervention versus control) were not reported, and therefore could not be included in the analyses for this review. Also, although the authors label the intervention as "distraction", they describe it as involving distraction with parent coaching. Therefore, we classified it in the 'Parent Coaching + Child Distraction' intervention category for this review. Lastly, the intervention and control groups differed in terms of various variables (e.g., type of topical analgesic used, parental presence, number of cannulation attempts); however, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups on any of these variables. </P>

<P>1. Virtual Reality (VR) Distraction (n = 17): Adolescents in this wore VR glasses during their LPs, in addition to receiving standard nursing care. The glasses were similar to oversized sunglasses with earphones attacked. Subjects were placed in the standard side lying position for their LPs with a videocassette recorder/television placed at eye level. They all watched the same video through the glasses, which provided 3D viewing, and listened to music in stereo sound. The VR video entitled &#8216;Escape&#8217; included 64 minutes of footage and contained experiences of skiing down the Swiss Alps, explosive drag racing, a stroll down Paris sidewalks, and visions of quiet mountain streams. Prior to conscious sedations, nurses used a standardized script to explain the purpose of the VR glasses to subjects and the need to focus their attention on what they were hearing and seeing instead of on the discomfort of the procedure. The subjects started watching the video when placed on the procedure table at the beginning of the LP and finished when the sedation recovery criteria were met.</P>
<P>2. Standard Care Comparison (n = 13): Adolescents in this group received standard nursing care for an LP including: (a) weight-based conscious sedations using Fentanyl and Midazolam, (b) 2.5 grams of EMLA cream applied at the spinal injection site, (c) a full explanation of the LP given to them and their parent, and (d) parental presence at their patient&#8217;s side for support.
