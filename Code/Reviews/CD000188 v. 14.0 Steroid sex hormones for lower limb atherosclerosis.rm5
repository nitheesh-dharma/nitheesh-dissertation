<TITLE>Testosterone and oestrogen steroid sex hormones for lower limb atherosclerosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-24 10:19:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Atherosclerosis of the arteries of the legs can become symptomatic as people age. People affected may experience discomfort and cramping pain in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest, termed intermittent claudication. Some people with claudication go on to require reconstructive surgery and even amputation of a leg. Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood flow problems. The steroid sex hormones oestrogens and testosterone affect a number of these risk factors, particularly cholesterol and blood clotting, and may be helpful in peripheral vascular disease.</P>
<P>Although four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 middle-aged to elderly people, predominantly men. The participants had symptoms of lower limb atherosclerosis, predominantly intermittent claudication. The trials were published from 1967 to 1971 and all took place in Denmark. Testosterone did not provide any clear improvement in the symptoms reported by the participants, walking distance or other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease including leg muscle blood flow. The dose of testosterone in the trials varied between 300 mg taken by mouth every two weeks for three months to a lower (100 mg) oral dose taken more often and 200 mg given by intramuscular injection, first weekly then every two weeks for six months. Side effects were poorly reported except for subjective sexual functioning, which did seem to improve with testosterone treatment. No trials investigated oestrogens in women with lower limb atherosclerosis.</P>
<P>Trials by the Women's Health Initiative (published in 2004) have shown that oestrogen and progestin does not confer any protection against peripheral arterial disease in healthy postmenopausal women or reduce the risk of coronary events in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease.</P>

<P>Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis.</P>
<P>Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non-significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to date that short-term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-21 11:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>In Western societies, 8% of the population in late middle age demonstrate asymptomatic atherosclerosis of the lower limb and 5% experience intermittent claudication. Up to 20% of claudicants go on to require reconstructive surgery and 1% to 2% eventually undergo amputation. Follow-up studies have shown that claudicants have mortality rates three times that of the general population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although its full aetiology is unknown, several risk factors for peripheral arterial disease have been identified, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and haemostatic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>). There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones affect a number of these risk factors. For example, exogenous oestrogens improve the lipid profile and fibrinogen levels of postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Manolio-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manolio 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabulsi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabulsi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PEPI-Trial-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEPI Trial 1995</LINK>). They may also increase HDL cholesterol and reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in men (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1956</LINK>). In males, endogenous testosterone levels have been associated with raised HDL cholesterol and a reduction in many of the haemostatic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Bonithon_x002d_Kopp-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonithon-Kopp 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Their advantageous effect on risk factor profiles provides a plausible mechanism by which steroid sex hormones may influence the progression of peripheral arterial disease. Indeed, early trials of testosterone in lower limb atherosclerosis were prompted by its observed activation of the blood fibrinolytic system (<LINK REF="REF-Fearnley-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fearnley 1962</LINK>). More recently, an estimated 50% reduction in the incidence of coronary artery disease in postmenopausal women taking exogenous oestrogens compared with non-oestrogen users (<LINK REF="REF-Stampfer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stampfer 1991</LINK>) stimulated interest in a potential protective effect for female sex hormones in cardiovascular disease. Clinical trials of hormone therapy in the prevention of coronary disease in women have been undertaken in the UK and the USA, including ESPRIT (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2000</LINK>), the Women's Health Initiative (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-Study-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI Study Group 1998</LINK>), the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (<LINK REF="REF-Hulley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulley 1998</LINK>) and the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis Trial (<LINK REF="REF-Herrington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrington 2000</LINK>). Two of these trials have shown that oestrogen/progestin does not confer any protection against peripheral arterial disease in healthy postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Hsia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 2004</LINK>) or reduce the risk of coronary events in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We aim to determine whether there is evidence that steroid sex hormones are beneficial in the treatment of lower limb atherosclerosis.</P>

<P>Summary details of included studies are given in the (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) table. Four trials were identified which met the inclusion criteria, but one of these was subsequently excluded as there was no adequate information on whether or not it was randomised, or on the type of clinical tests used, and the results could not be obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Albrechtsen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Albrechtsen 1972</LINK>; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The three remaining trials, all undertaken in Denmark, investigated testosterone versus placebo in a total of 109 subjects suffering from the symptoms of lower limb atherosclerosis - predominantly intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Genster-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Genster 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials on the effects of oestrogens were identified.</P>
<P>In all trials, the diagnosis of intermittent claudication was confirmed by clinical examination and, in the Hentzer trial, by a reduced muscle blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). Clinical judgement of heterogeneity indicated that the populations involved in the trials were similar (middle-aged to elderly subjects, predominantly men), and that all trials used the same sex hormone (testosterone). However, the interventions varied by dose of testosterone and the route and duration of administration. Hentzer used 200 mg testosterone (intramuscularly) weekly for three weeks and once every two weeks thereafter, for a total of six months (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). Dohn administered 300 mg testosterone (orally) once every two weeks, for a total of three months (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>). The latter was a cross-over study (testosterone for three months followed by placebo for three months or vice versa) (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>). Genster used 100 mg testosterone three times per week for two to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Genster-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Genster 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of tests were performed in each of the trials but detailed results were available for only a proportion of these. None of the trials included mortality or cardiovascular event outcomes. The only disease outcome reported in all trials was subjective change in symptoms.</P>

<P>The methods used in the included trials are described in detail in the table of 'Characteristics of included studies'. Patients were allocated by alternation in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>) and it was stated that 'drugs were coded' in another (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>).

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-08-21 11:09:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>
<B>Walking tests</B>
<BR/>Hentzer recorded the time until onset of claudication while patients walked up and down the same five steps at their own constant tempo (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). After six months, there was no significant difference in the number of subjects who improved on this test between the treatment and placebo groups (16 of 19 in the experimental group and 15 of 17 in the control group; Chi-squared, P &gt; 0.1).</P>
<P>In the Dohn trial, change in performance of a metronome walking test was recorded, with the mean walking test result at baseline given a value of 1.00 (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the mean change in performance in the experimental group (1.06, standard deviation (SD) = 0.65) and the corresponding change in the control group (1.07, SD = 0.68), after the first 12 week period of the cross-over trial. It was not possible to extract further results for this test from the data presented.</P>
<P>
<B>Venous filling time</B>
<BR/>Hentzer monitored venous filling time in all the legs of his subjects which demonstrated arterial insufficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). This was done with the leg hanging vertically but no other details of the measurement were given. The venous filling time improved, as defined by a change from &gt; 15 seconds to &lt; 15 seconds in at least one leg, in one of 19 subjects in the experimental group and three of 17 subjects in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant (Chi-squared, P &gt; 0.1).</P>
<P>
<B>Muscle blood flow</B>
<BR/>Hentzer (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>) also measured muscle blood flow through the muscles of all the affected legs, using the clearance of Xe-133 injected into the anterior tibialis muscle by the method described by Lassen and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Lassen-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassen 1964</LINK>). There was no difference in the number of legs with an increase in muscle blood flow between the experimental group (19 of 32) and the control group (15 of 30; Chi-squared, P &gt; 0.1). However, mean muscle blood flow increased by 3.3 ml/100 g/min in the experimental group and decreased by 0.7 ml/100 g/min in the control group (P = 0.025 quoted in the original paper).</P>
<P>
<B>Plethysmography</B>
<BR/>In the Dohn trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dohn-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dohn 1968</LINK>), plethysmographic measurements of peripheral pulse volume, blood flow at rest, reactive hyperaemia after five minutes of arterial compression and leg circulation after walking and exercise were taken. Improvement in these measurements was reported in 10 of 36 patients in the experimental group and nine of 38 patients in the control group (Chi- squared, P &gt; 0.1).</P>
<P>
<B>Symptomatic change</B>
<BR/>All trials recorded symptoms of intermittent claudication and reported the number of subjects in each treatment group with subjective improvement at the end of the trial. However, the method used to collect this information was not described. The overall odds ratio for symptomatic improvement was not significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects</B>
<BR/>In Hentzer's study, there was no significant difference in muscle strength according to a hand dynamometer between the experimental (37.7 kg, SD = 2.1) and control (37 kg, SD = 2.8) groups at the end of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hentzer-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Hentzer 1967</LINK>). However, a significantly higher number of subjects reported a subjective increase in sexual functioning in the experimental group (21 out of 62) compared with the control group (6 of 60) when the results of the two trials were combined (Chi-squared, P = 0.01).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The only available randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in peripheral arterial disease involved the use of testosterone in predominantly male populations. Even in this area the data are extremely limited. Only three, small-scale trials are available, involving the use of testosterone over relatively short periods of time and variable methods of measuring peripheral arterial disease. No trials are available which investigated oestrogenic hormones.</P>
<P>Overall, testosterone treatment was found to have no significant effect on disease outcomes, including subjective improvement in symptoms and tests of walking distance. It is still possible that testosterone could affect the progression of peripheral arterial disease but at present there are insufficient data to support this notion.</P>
<P>Side effects were poorly reported except for subjective sexual functioning, which did seem to be improved by testosterone treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-20 13:01:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently no evidence that patients with peripheral arterial disease might benefit from treatment with testosterone, although this may reflect a lack of data rather than the absence of a real effect. Moreover, long-term use of testosterone would be difficult to justify in view of the potential side effects of anabolic steroids.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-20 13:01:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>Although it is still possible that testosterone could affect the progression of peripheral arterial disease, further trials would be difficult to justify at the present time. Firstly, observational studies on the association between testosterone and coronary artery disease are inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Kalin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalin 1990</LINK>). Secondly, few studies have carefully assessed the adverse effects of prolonged exogenous testosterone administration in non-hormone deficient men (<LINK REF="REF-Matsumoto-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsumoto 1990</LINK>). </P>
