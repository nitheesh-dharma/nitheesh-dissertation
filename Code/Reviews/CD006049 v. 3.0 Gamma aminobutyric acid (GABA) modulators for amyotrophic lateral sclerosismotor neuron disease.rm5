<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-22 16:02:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Do medicines that promote the effects of the brain chemical gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) delay the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>ALS, which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a condition that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. A person with ALS gradually loses the ability to control movement. In about two-thirds of people with ALS, the condition affects the arms first, and difficulty walking will follow. The muscles of the throat can also become weak, which affects swallowing and speaking. As the disease progresses, muscle wasting worsens, with stiffness, cramping and loss of the ability to move. Death generally occurs within two to five years.</P>
<P>Glutamate is a chemical mediator in the brain that stimulates motor neurons. Glutamate overproduction is probably responsible for motor neuron damage in ALS. The molecule GABA acts to lessen the effects of glutamate. Medicines that increase GABA activity (GABA modulators), such as gabapentin and baclofen, are possible treatments for ALS. This is the first systematic review of the evidence from clinical trials of GABA modulators for ALS.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>A systematic search of the medical literature found two randomized trials of gabapentin compared with placebo (inactive treatment). The same team of scientists performed both trials, which were sponsored by the manufacturer. The trials involved a total of 355 people with ALS. Treatment with gabapentin lasted six and nine months. We found no trials of baclofen or other GABA modulators in ALS that met our selection criteria. We assessed the gabapentin trials as well run and well conducted.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Neither of the trials were long enough to for us to report survival at one year. Combined results from the two studies (based on 274 participants) provided high-quality evidence of little or no difference in estimated one-year survival, the rate of decline in respiratory function, or rate of decline in arm strength in people treated with gabapentin compared to those treated with placebo. One trial (128 participants) measured quality of life and monthly decline in function (measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale). There was little or no difference in the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) or quality of life between the gabapentin group and the placebo group.</P>
<P>People who received gabapentin had more light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling than those taking placebo when we combined data from both trials (353 participants). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups.</P>
<P>In conclusion, high-quality evidence indicates that gabapentin does not extend survival or slow the rate of decline of muscle strength or respiratory function. Moderate-quality evidence shows no effect on quality of life or decline in ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized trials.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to August 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-21 17:58:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Imbalance of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related modulators has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). In this context, the role and mechanism of action of gabapentin and baclofen have been extensively investigated, although with conflicting results. This is the first systematic review to assess clinical trials of GABA modulators for the treatment of ALS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:17:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>To examine the efficacy of gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators in delaying the progression of ALS, and to evaluate adverse effects of these interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:23:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 16 August 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and LILACS. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of the trials found in order to identify any other trials, and contacted trial authors to identify relevant unpublished results or additional clinical trials. On 30 August 2016, we searched two clinical trials registries.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:23:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Types of studies: double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs</P>
<P>Types of participants: adults with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS</P>
<P>Types of interventions: gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators compared with placebo, no treatment, or each other</P>
<P>Primary outcome: survival at one year from study enrollment</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes: individual rate of decline of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), expressed as arm megascore; rate of decline of per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC); rate of decline of ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS); health-related quality of life; survival evaluated by pooling hazards; and adverse events</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:37:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>At least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-22 15:53:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified two double-blind RCTs of gabapentin treatment in ALS for inclusion in this review. We found no eligible RCTs of baclofen or other GABA modulators. The selected studies were phase II and phase III trials, which lasted six and nine months, respectively. They were highly comparable because both were comparisons of oral gabapentin and placebo, performed by the same investigators. The trials enrolled 355 participants with ALS: 80 in the gabapentin group and 72 in the placebo group in the first (phase II) trial and 101 in the gabapentin group and 102 in the placebo group in the second (phase III) trial. Neither trial was long enough to report survival at one year, which was our primary outcome. We found little or no difference in estimated one-year survival between the treated group and the placebo group (78% versus 77%, P = 0.63 by log-rank test; high-quality evidence). We also found little or no difference in the rate of decline of MVIC expressed as arm megascore, or rate of FVC decline (high-quality evidence). One trial investigated monthly decline in the ALSFRS and quality of life measured using the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) and found little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality evidence). The trials reported similar adverse events. Complaints that were clearly elevated in those taking gabapentin, based on analyses of the combined data, were light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling (high-quality evidence). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the included trials as low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-22 16:02:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>According to high-quality evidence, gabapentin is not effective in treating ALS. It does not extend survival, slow the rate of decline of muscle strength, respiratory function and, based on moderate-quality evidence, probably does not improve quality of life or slow monthly decline in the ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-21 18:07:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 18:07:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND), Lou Gehrig's or Charcot's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. The condition results in progressive weakness and paralysis of voluntary muscles, which ultimately leads to death. Median prevalence (per 100,000 population) has been estimated as 5.4 (interquartile range (IQR) 4.06 to 7.89) in Europe and 3.4 (IQR 3.15 to 3.65) in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Chi_x00f2_-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiò 2013</LINK>). Although the cause of ALS remains unknown, so-called excitotoxicity induced by an imbalance of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to be important in pathogenesis, because excitotoxicity is thought to trigger irreversible cell damage (for a review, see <LINK REF="REF-Rao-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2004</LINK>). Glutamate has been suggested as a possible chemical insult for triggering the slow neuronal demise and related abnormalities in glutamate metabolism seen in ALS, which include elevated glutamate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<LINK REF="REF-Plaitakis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plaitakis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spreux_x002d_Varoquaux-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spreux-Varoquaux 2002</LINK>). The discovery that GABA content is increased in the serum and CSF of people with ALS led investigators to consider its possible contribution to ALS pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Niebroj_x002d_Dobosz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niebroj-Dobosz 1999</LINK>). In addition, anatomical analysis of human postmortem brains revealed a significantly reduced expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for the GABA receptor subunit (alpha1-subunit) (<LINK REF="REF-Petri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 2003</LINK>). These findings correspond with those of a positron emission tomography study using the ligand flumazenil that showed downregulation of GABA receptors, which is likely to reflect a loss of interneuronal function (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2000</LINK>). However, electrophysiological measurements revealed no correlation between the ALS hyperexcitability index in different motor units and changes in serum and CSF levels of GABA (<LINK REF="REF-Kostera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kostera 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-19 10:08:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Pharmacological reversal of cortical hyperexcitability in people with ALS has been observed after sustained treatment with GABA modulators such as gabapentin (<LINK REF="STD-Caramia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Caramia 2000</LINK>), even though experiments with rat neocortical slices found no effect of gabapentin on GABA release because of the selective activation of presynaptic GABA-B heteroreceptors (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Baclofen is a GABA agonist with some efficacy in reducing spasticity of cerebral or spinal origin in people with ALS (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1979</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-21 18:00:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The above studies indicate that the mechanism of action of gabapentin is still controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1998</LINK>). They provided a rationale for undertaking clinical trials of gabapentin in ALS, despite the fact that gabapentin is not a structural analog of GABA (<LINK REF="REF-Satzinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satzinger 1994</LINK>), but simply a compound with conformational properties that mimic its amino acid structure (<LINK REF="REF-Bryans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryans 1999</LINK>). Although the evidence supporting a role for GABA is under debate, sufficient data exist to justify trials of the GABA agonist baclofen or the GABA modulator gabapentin in ALS.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-19 10:09:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>While treatment for spasticity and cramps in ALS have been the subjects of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baldinger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldinger 2012</LINK>), no systematic review has addressed the benefit of GABA modulators such as gabapentin or baclofen in slowing the clinical progression of ALS. Thus, the specific aim of this review is to assess the clinical impact of GABA modulators as disease-modifying agents.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-12-22 10:30:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We obtained Individual participant data for statistical analyses. We combined data from the two trials for meta-analysis where both trials reported the same outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We obtained data from the principal investigators for each participant in each of the clinical trials included in this review. For survival, we combined the data from the studies into a single data file and used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival at 12 months after enrollment into the trial. We also used the log-rank statistic to test whether participants treated with gabapentin had longer survival than those treated with placebo.</P>
<P>Both studies used rate of decline in arm megascore strength (MVIC) of eight arm muscle groups (bilateral shoulder and elbow flexion and extension) as their primary measure of efficacy. Both studies measured MVIC every four weeks. Raw scores for MVIC were standardized to published norms using z-score transformations (raw score minus norm average divided by norm standard deviation). The arm megascore was calculated as the average z-score over all tested muscles for each participant at each visit. The primary outcome measure was the mean slope of the arm megascores (rate of decrease over time, measured in days from initial visit), for each participant in the intent-to-treat population, which included all participants randomized to a study medication (active or placebo) and having at least two visits to the center.</P>
<P>In the original analyses of each study a slope was estimated by linear regression for each participant and mean slopes for treated and placebo were compared using t-test or Mann-Whitney test. These analyses weighted each participant equally, regardless of the number of times each participant was evaluated.</P>
<P>In this meta-analysis, we pooled individual participant data from the trials and fit a linear mixed effects (lme) model to the combined data. This model takes into account the number of times each participant is evaluated so that those with more evaluations receive greater weight when estimating model parameters. The lme model also estimates pooled variances rather than separate ones when each participant is fit separately using linear regression. (The lme model was not available for the phase II study in 1996.) We also use the lme model to fit combined FVC data.</P>
<P>Our statistical model assumed that arm megascore (transformed to average z-score) and FVC declined linearly over time. When fitting the pooled data, the lme model included fixed-effect terms for intercept (starting value), slope (rate of decline over time), and change in slope for gabapentin treatment. Random effects for intercept and slope allowed for person-to-person differences in slope and intercept and an additional random effect for each participant's deviation from the linear fit. The model is given mathematically by the formula:</P>
<P>        Yij = (B0 + b0i) + (B1 + B2*Ii + b1i)*Tij + eij,</P>
<P>where i indicates participant and Tij indicates time (month of the jth measurement in the ith participant). Capital letters indicate fixed-effect coefficients and lower case letters are random effects. The term Ii is an indicator equal to 1 for the ith participant on active treatment and 0 for placebo. We also added fixed-effect terms to test whether treatment effects differed by trial, symptom duration, and initial arm megascore.</P>
<P>We used Stata version 11.0 for the above statistical analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Stata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used a fixed-effect model for these analyses as the two included trials were performed with similar methods by the same investigators, and we consider them very likely to be measuring the same effects. We assessed heterogeneity in the meta-analyses visually and using the Chi² test and I² statistic calculated by RevMan. We followed guidance for rule of thumb interpretation of I² in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Overall, there was little or no difference in arm megascore decline between the gabapentin-treated group and placebo group.</P>
<P>The original report of results from the phase III trial noted that symptom duration was significantly shorter for participants assigned to gabapentin than for participants assigned to placebo. This report also noted a difference in arm megascore rate of decline in the placebo groups between the two trials. To account for these factors, we added terms to the lme model to account for differences in slopes between the two trials and for symptom duration. Both of these factors were significant, that is, arm megascore slopes differed significantly in the two trials and symptom duration had a significant effect on slopes.</P>
<P>Table 1 summarizes the results of fitting the combined arm megascore with the lme model (N = 345). Interestingly, when we fit data from each trial separately, the effect of gabapentin was positive (i.e. reduced slope) in the phase II trial and was negative (i.e. increased slope) in the phase III trial. However, neither effect was statistically significant, nor was there a statistically significant difference in effect (P = 0.19 for a differential effect; high-quality evidence).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The two trials reported adverse events, which were similar in kind. When we combined data from both trials (N = 353; high-quality evidence), complaints that were elevated in those taking gabapentin were light-headedness (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.40), drowsiness (RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.33), and limb swelling (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.02). Falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>, but not in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK> (RR from the combined analysis 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.57). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK> reported only these adverse events, which were those that occurred with a significantly greater frequency in the gabapentin group. We have also presented the other adverse events reported in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK> with a greater than five per cent frequency in gabapentin or placebo groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK> (N = 149) reported a greater frequency of fatigue with gabapentin than with placebo (RR 3.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 12.92) and a lower frequency of headache with gabapentin than with placebo (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.00), with little or no difference between the two groups in other recorded events. No important heterogeneity was apparent in the adverse event meta-analyses.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-22 16:03:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified two RCTs of gabapentin in ALS involving a total of 355 participants and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. The trials were to short to provide data on survival a year after enrollment, which was the primary outcome of the review. However, there was little or no difference in estimated survival at one year in the gabapentin-treated group versus the placebo group in either trial, or in the combined data. The arm megascore was the primary outcome measure of both trials. Results from the phase II trial showed a trend toward a slowing of the decline of arm megascore, even though this difference did not reach a statistical significance (defined as P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK>). Results from the randomized phase III trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>), as well as analysis of the combined arm megascore data from both trials, showed no therapeutic benefit with gabapentin in people with ALS. FVC, the other major outcome measure in these studies, is still an important outcome measure in ALS trials because of the importance of pulmonary function to people with ALS. Here again, there was little or no benefit from treatment. One trial measured monthly decline in the ALSFRS and quality of life using the SF-12 and found that there was probably little or no difference between groups for ALSFRS and quality of life. Drowsiness, light-headedness, and limb swelling occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo, based on combined analyses. Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 18:23:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In the absence of trials of baclofen and other GABA modulators, the identified trials of gabapentin fit the overall requirements for inclusion in the review. One of the trials did not measure quality of life or ALSFRS (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-22 16:19:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We consider the two studies that were included to yield high-quality evidence that gabapentin is not effective in ALS. We did not consider these studies to be completely free of any risk of bias, but both had adequate blinding, sequence generation and outcome reporting. We therefore assessed the risk of bias in these trials as low. We identified no reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence based on the GRADE criteria of indirectness, inconsistency, publication bias, or study limitations. We downgraded quality of life and decline in ALSFRS outcomes for imprecision due to the small sample size (128 participants) of the one trial that provided data. </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-19 10:16:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Review authors who were not investigators in the trials assessed risk of bias in the selected studies.

<P>A Cochrane review reported that gabapentin had no benefit in trial participants with type II and III spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is another, more slowly progressive, motor neuron disease (<LINK REF="REF-Wadman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadman 2012</LINK>).<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-22 16:20:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>According to high-quality evidence, gabapentin is not effective in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), because it neither halts nor slows progression of ALS. Gabapentin does not improve estimated survival at one year nor slow the rate of decline of muscle strength or respiratory function. Gabapentin probably has little or no effect on quality of life or monthly decline in ALS functional rating scale. No evidence from randomized trials was available for other gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-modulating treatments.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-19 10:44:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Further studies of gabapentin to slow progression of ALS are unlikely to be fruitful. The literature provides no indication of alternative promising GABA modulators.</P>

<P>1. This is the pooled mean rate of decline from the two studies, as reported in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>.<BR/>2. We used a linear mixed effect model to account for differences in slopes between the two trials and for symptom duration. One of the trials (the phase II, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK>) had an unusually rapid placebo group decline.<BR/>3. The basis for the assumed risk is the combined fit of FVC slopes from the 2 included studies.<BR/>4. The basis for the assumed risk is the placebo group ALSFRS-R slope.<BR/>5. We downgraded the evidence once for imprecision (small study size), as one study with 128 participants provided data for this outcome.<BR/>
