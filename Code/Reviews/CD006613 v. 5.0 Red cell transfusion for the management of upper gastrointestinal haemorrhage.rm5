<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-03 22:51:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract is common, affecting up to 1 in 1000 adults per year. It leads to death in 10% to 30% of cases, depending on whether patients are admitted with bleeding or bleed whilst in hospital with something else. Patients present with vomiting of fresh or partially digested blood, or with the passage of digested blood from the bowel (melaena). They may also present with symptoms associated with low blood pressure (which can occur secondary to rapid haemorrhage), or with symptoms of anaemia. Red blood cells may be transfused to patients to improve the blood pressure, haemoglobin concentration, or both, before the cause of the bleeding is identified and treated, usually with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients may also receive a transfusion after endoscopy to correct the haemoglobin concentration once the haemorrhage has been controlled. It is possible that blood transfusion (which has some serious potential adverse effects) may not always improve the patients' condition and may even make the bleeding worse.</P>
<P>It seems counterintuitive to question the value of red blood cell transfusion in cases of acute haemorrhage, but accepted practice has to be challenged.</P>
<P>This update found no new eligible trials. The original review found three trials investigating the effects of red blood cell transfusion in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There were more deaths recorded in the transfusion arm of the combined studies compared to the control arm. It is by no means clear that transfusion is a surrogate marker for more severe haemorrhage. The deaths were too few and the trials too disparate to draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of transfusion on mortality. We can only recommend that further, larger studies are done.</P>

<P>For this update, we re-ran the initial search strategies from the last issue/month searched until March 2010.</P>
<P>We previously searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register to February 2008, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, issue 1<I>)</I>, MEDLINE (1950 to February 2008), EMBASE (1974 to February 2008), the Systematic Review Initiative database of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), haematology and gastroenterology conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:40:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials involving 126 patients were included, with complete data available for 93 patients. The participants were heterogeneous, none of the three studies examined exactly the same interventions or measured the same outcomes. Only two trials reported mortality data and the summary relative risk for mortality of the intervention was 5.4 (95% CI 0.27 to 107.09). One trial reported increased coagulation times in the transfused group, and reported these patients to have increased rates of rebleeding. None of the studies reported adverse events directly related to RBC transfusion. Methodological deficiencies, including allocation concealment, generation of random sequences and blinding, simply compound the uncertainty surrounding analysis. None of the studies were appropriately powered and in the largest study fewer than half the participants were included in the final analysis.</P>
<P>One RCT of restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion aims to recruit 860 patients but has yet to be completed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:35:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were more deaths and more rebleeding in the transfusion arms of the combined studies, but the small numbers of participants and large volume of missing data limit the significance of the findings. The studies in this review do not provide useful data regarding outcomes following red blood cell transfusion for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. They appear to exclude large survival benefit. Large, well-concealed RCTs of sufficient power are urgently needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:06:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Bleeding into the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract occurs when there is damage (erosion or ulceration) to the protective mucosal layer overlying the blood vessels in the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum. The integrity of this layer can be affected by alcohol, drugs, infection or excess gastric acid production (which itself has many causes). Bleeding can also occur due to abnormal blood vessels in the upper gastrointestinal tract. These can be caused by primary malformation, e.g. arteriovenous malformations (abnormal blood vessels directly connecting small arteries with small veins, producing very high blood pressure in these vessels), or by abnormal development of high pressure vessels, as in gastric or oesophageal varices, most commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease.</P>
<P>Blood loss can be chronic and present in the form of iron deficient anaemia. If the bleeding is from a large vessel or multiple vessels at the same time however, the patient presents with an acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage with haematemesis (vomiting blood), melaena (passage of black tarry stool), circulatory collapse, or a combination of these.</P>
<P>The consequences of acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage are primarily related to the loss of circulatory volume, as would occur with significant blood loss from anywhere. The hypotension and reduced tissue perfusion (blood flow to cells, tissues and organs) increase the risks of damage to vital organs. This can lead to significant morbidity and death. Restoring the circulatory volume to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg, and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute, reduces this risk (<LINK REF="REF-Grenvick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grenvick 2000</LINK>). Fluid replacement guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) (expert opinion) are based on clinical parameters and estimation of blood loss. They advise red blood cell transfusion when bleeding is extreme (as judged by either active haematemesis, haematemesis with shock, or both), and/or when the haemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, in patients with no previous history of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2002</LINK>). The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines similarly recommend "that packed red blood cells should be transfused in patients with evidence of ongoing or active blood loss who have experienced significant blood loss or cardiac ischaemia" (<LINK REF="REF-ASGE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASGE 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Once the patient has been adequately fluid-resuscitated, the management of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage involves identifying the cause of the blood loss and treating the bleeding area directly. This is usually done with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopically-administered direct therapy. Medications to heal ulceration and other specific medical therapies (for example, to lower blood pressure in varices) are also recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2002</LINK>). Surgery or radiological intervention is needed if the haemorrhage cannot be satisfactorily controlled after endoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Scheim-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheim 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Red blood cell transfusion can be used in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage as part of fluid resuscitation in an actively bleeding patient, and also to address the haematological abnormalities that can result. There are different volumes and schedules of red blood cell transfusion that can be administered, according to whether it is being used for primary resuscitation (as described above) or as an adjunctive therapy in the management process. The evidence for the use of red blood cells in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage has not been systematically reviewed.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:06:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 2004 a prospective study in the North of England revealed that 13.8% of all red cell transfusions were for the management of patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Wallis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallis 2006</LINK>). In collaboration with the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), a National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) survey of the current management of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) haemorrhage has been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Hearnshaw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearnshaw 2008</LINK>). The first large multi-centre survey of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the UK was published in 1995 and confirmed that upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is common (incidence 103 per 100,000) and has a high risk of death (overall mortality 14%) (<LINK REF="REF-Rockall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockall 1995</LINK>). It identified five clinical indicators (age, shock, medical co-morbidity, diagnosis and stigmata of recent haemorrhage) as the best predictors of outcome from upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. In 2002 the BSG published guidelines for the management of acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2002</LINK>). They were based on best available evidence and still represent the current standard of care in the UK. The 2007 survey assessed changes to mortality data as well as looking at the current use of blood components in upper gastrointestinal bleeding management. It showed that crude overall in-hospital mortality has decreased (from 14% to 10%) and that red blood cell transfusion was given to 43% of patients.</P>
<P>No systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusion management in patients with an upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been carried out. This is now warranted.</P>

<P>For the current update two authors (Vipul Jairath (VJ) and Susan Brunskill (SB)) screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy for inclusion. No new relevant studies were found for inclusion.</P>
<P>For the original review, one author, Sarah Hearnshaw (SH), screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy for relevance. She excluded studies that were clearly irrelevant at this stage. Two authors (Chris Hyde (CH) and SH) then independently formally assessed the full text (or abstracts from conference proceedings) for eligibility.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>For included studies, we designed a data extraction form to facilitate collection of data relating to study characteristics, methodological quality and outcome measures. We piloted the data extraction forms and assessed inter-observer reproducibility. The forms did not require redesign after testing. Two authors (CH, SH) completed data extraction independently. We resolved disagreements by discussion between authors. One author transcribed the data into the systematic review computer software RevMan 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). The following criteria formed the main evaluation of methodological quality (adapted from <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>), and a summary of each of these criteria for each study is presented in the description of studies.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Generation of random allocation sequence.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of treatment allocation schedule.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (for clinician, participant and outcome assessor). We acknowledged that blinding in studies of blood transfusion trials is very difficult to design, so emphasis was placed on other methodological quality criteria, including concealment of allocation.</LI>
<LI>The proportion of randomised participants included in the main analysis. We noted particularly where more than 20% were 'lost'. Account was also taken of differing levels of loss to follow up that affected the validity of the results for different outcomes to different degrees.</LI>
<LI>Equal use of co-interventions in each study arm.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Where information was unclear or missing, we attempted clarification by contacting the author of the primary study. Two authors evaluated the methodological quality independently (SH, CH). We resolved disagreements by consensus between the authors, but did not formally assess inter-rater reliability.</P>
<P>We recorded problems in respect of the methodological criteria in full. We have presented a narrative summary in tabular format within the review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In addition, we rated the items numbered 1) to 5) according to criteria identified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>), whereby ratings of A (adequate), B (unclear) or C (clearly inadequate) are assigned to each item.</P>
<P>Aside from details relating to included study quality, we extracted two main groups of data using the standard forms:</P>
<P>
<I>Study characteristics</I> - place of publication, date of publication, population characteristics, setting, detailed nature of intervention, detailed nature of comparator, detailed nature of outcomes. A key purpose of these data was to explain clinical heterogeneity in the included studies independently from the analysis of results.</P>
<P>
<I>Results of included studies</I> in respect of each of the main outcomes indicated in the review question. For dichotomous outcomes we recorded the numbers of outcomes in the treatment and control groups. For continuous data we recorded outcomes, means, standard errors and standard deviations.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>We expressed dichotomous data for each arm in a particular study as proportions or risks, and the treatment effect as a relative risk or risk ratio (RR). We also examined risk differences but not as the primary method of examining the results. We expressed continuous data for each arm in a particular study as mean and standard deviation and the treatment effect as weighted mean difference.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>We sought missing data from the authors. Where data were missing through loss to follow up, we used intention-to-treat principles.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>We assessed clinical heterogeneity based on the data extracted about the characteristics of the included studies. Due to the small number of trials and the small number of participants in each trial, the application of this was very limited. We investigated statistical heterogeneity in relation to aspects of the study population, intervention, outcome measurements and study quality, particularly allocation concealment. We did not undertake meta-regression as data were insufficient.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Due to the small number of studies identified, we did not use funnel plots to detect reporting and publication bias.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>We attempted meta-analyses using the random-effects model (as blood transfusion is not a totally standardised intervention) using RevMan 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>As well as quantitative synthesis, the overall interpretation also incorporates insights from qualitative summary. We based conclusions on patterns of results identified across tabulated results of included studies, as well as summary measures. We have considered both the direction and magnitude of any effect.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:16:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The update search generated 260 citations from the databases. No new relevant citations were found.</P>
<P>The original search strategy generated 914 citations from the databases, and we identified two conference abstracts as potentially relevant. Many of these were studies totally unrelated to gastrointestinal bleeding or transfusion but which involved medications or therapies that reported gastrointestinal side effects and therefore they were not included. In total, six studies that appeared relevant were identified for possible inclusion from the searches above. Two authors (SH, CH) then assessed these for inclusion/exclusion on the basis of the full text abstract or paper using the stated criteria (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified one ongoing trial from ClinicalTrials.gov (<LINK REF="STD-Villanueva" TYPE="STUDY">Villanueva</LINK>). Contact with the author confirmed that recruitment was continuing and that data were not available for inclusion in the review. The study aims to recruit 860 patients in total, to be able to measure a change in mortality of 5% (using global mortality in the control group of 10%) with a type 1 error of 5% and a type II error of 20%. The study is being conducted in a single centre in Barcelona, Spain and is based in the hospital gastrointestinal bleeding unit. The intervention arm will restrict red blood cell transfusion to patients with a haemoglobin concentration &lt; 7 g/dL to maintain this between 7 and 9 g/dL, and the control arm receive "habitual" red blood cell transfusion when the haemoglobin concentration falls below 9 g/dL to maintain this between 9 and 11 g/dL. It is not clear at what stage patients are being randomised (i.e. before initial resuscitation, after initial resuscitation or after endoscopy).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In two of the three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>) the participants were haemodynamically stable at randomisation and received red blood cell transfusion and standard care (intervention), or other intravenous fluid and standard care (control). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>) participants were randomised when they were still haemodynamically unstable, but red blood cell transfusion was not given to the intervention group until they had been initially resuscitated using Haemacell<SUP>TM</SUP>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of units or volume of red blood cells transfused</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention group</HEADING>
<P>The mean total number of units of red blood cells transfused varied between studies. Two studies recorded a minimum two-unit red blood cell transfusion as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>), and one study recorded red blood cell transfusion given "to maintain haematocrit &gt; 28%", but did not state the volume of red blood cells given (<LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). Red blood cell transfusion volume was recorded as an outcome in all three studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Control group</HEADING>
<P>In two studies alternative fluids were given in the control arm; namely 500 ml protein solution (<LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>) or "crystalloid solution" (<LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). In the third study no other fluids were recorded as being given, other than initial resuscitation with Haemacell given to both the control and intervention groups, prior to transfusion (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Schedule for transfusion</HEADING>
<P>Different starting criteria applied to red blood cell transfusion. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK> randomised participants to receive, during their first 24 hours in hospital, either "at least 2 units of blood" or "no blood" after initial resuscitation with Haemacell. All participants were eligible to receive red blood cell transfusion after the first 24 hours. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK> required all participants to be haemodynamically stable after endoscopy, and to be anaemic (haematocrit &lt; 30%) prior to inclusion. Following interventions (red blood cell transfusion or protein solution), and laboratory and haemodynamic measurements, participants with a haematocrit remaining below 30% received red blood cell transfusion. The schedule of transfusion in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> was not clearly stated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Co-interventions</HEADING>
<P>In all three studies all participants underwent diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD). In <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK> all participants received endoscopic sclerotherapy for their variceal haemorrhage; all participants received lactulose, norfloxacin antibiotic therapy and 5% dextrose intravenous fluids prior to randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> three participants received endoscopic therapy for active bleeding but it was not stated whether they were in the intervention or control groups, or what the endoscopic therapy was. Endoscopic therapies were not recorded in <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; at this time endoscopic therapies were in their infancy and were unlikely to have been used routinely.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Publication date</HEADING>
<P>Publication dates for all trials were between 1986 and 1999, and therefore participants were enrolled in clinical studies before and up to these years. It is therefore likely that during the studies different standards of supportive care applied, and that these may be different again to those that apply now.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The study populations varied between the three trials. All studies included adult patients admitted with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.</P>
<P>The mean age of the participants varied significantly (the mean age in <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> being over 10 years younger than the mean age in the other two studies). None of the studies included children. The aetiology of the bleeding was mixed, with one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>) excluding patients with variceal haemorrhage and one study recruiting patients with haemorrhage associated with portal hypertension exclusively (<LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> patients with chronic or acute hepatic failure were excluded, although the authors report that patients with acute high digestive haemorrhage of "any aetiology" were to be included.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>All three studies used different inclusion criteria. In two studies no clear definition of 'acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage' was described (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK> provided a very clear definition: <I>"acute severe upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, onset in 24 hours prior to admissions with melaena, or vomiting more than one cupful of bright red blood"</I>. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>) required patients to have a specific haematocrit level prior to inclusion. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>) only included only patients who were haemodynamically stable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of patients</HEADING>
<P>The numbers of patients enrolled in all studies was small (range of total numbers randomised 16 to 60). None of the studies presented information on the sample sizes required to power the trial around a primary endpoint. None of the studies reported clear primary outcomes as their main endpoint.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies examined exactly the same outcomes. Of the three studies, information on overall mortality/survival was available from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). Mortality was recorded only if it occurred during the hospital admission in both studies. No mortality/survival data were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK> and none were available after attempts to contact the authors.</P>
<P>No recognised transfusion related complications were reported in any of the three included studies (e.g. febrile transfusion reactions, transfusion transmitted infections), but none of the studies report an intention to record transfusion complications as an outcome. Other adverse events were described by two of the studies: haematological complications by <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK> (with coagulation abnormalities and rebleeding described as outcomes), and haemodynamic events (cardiopulmonary pressures, recorded as outcomes) and hormonal measurements (e.g. plasma renin) by <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>None of the studies provided details of other supportive care provided to the participants, the type of blood available and used, or the use of other intravenous fluids (other than those used in the control arms as documented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Three randomised clinical trials of red blood cell transfusion in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage were eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). The first was published in 1986 and examined red blood cell transfusion in the first 24 hours versus no red blood cell transfusion in both haemodynamically stable and unstable patients with all-cause upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>). This study from the UK included 50 patients. The study published in 1998 was from Spain, included 16 patients with acute variceal haemorrhage, and compared two-unit red blood cell transfusion with 500 ml of a protein solution (<LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>). The final study, published in 1999, was conducted in Argentina (<LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> - paper translated from Spanish). This randomised 60 participants to red blood cell transfusion when the haematocrit dropped below 21% versus red blood cell transfusion when the haematocrit dropped below 28%.</P>
<P>All studies were parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and compared two groups of participants, one of which received red blood cell transfusion, the other receiving no red blood cell transfusion during the initial treatment and analysis period. Potentially important differences in the nature of the intervention, participant group and outcomes were found between all studies and will be explored below.</P>
<P>In total there were 126 patients eligible for analysis, although complete data are only available for 93 (74%).</P>
<P>It is clear from the details of the interventions and the participants described below, as well as from the variation in methodological quality of the studies, that the three studies are very different. Making direct comparisons between the studies and combining outcomes is neither practical nor useful, and interpretation of summary outcomes must be cautious.</P>

<P>In the original review two studies were excluded at the level of abstract scrutiny on the basis of lack of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Dallal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dallal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawaz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nawaz 2007</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sampliner-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sampliner 1975</LINK>) was excluded because it compared different fresh blood component therapies (51% fresh blood versus 22% fresh blood versus 25% component therapy consisting of packed cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrate), so was not comparing red blood cell transfusion specifically versus other therapy.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-08-04 15:01:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the included studies were all RCTs, they all had significant methodological weaknesses (
<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>
). The small numbers of participants in all the studies compromised the likelihood that there was equivalence in prognostic parameters at baseline, and significantly impacts on the reproducibility of the results. None of the studies report power calculations to identify the minimum participants required to detect effects of the interventions. Two studies reported methods of allocation by use of sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK> (after contact with the author); <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>). There was no detail on the method of generation of random sequence in <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> mentioned concealment of treatment allocation, but does not detail how this was achieved. Neither of the other two studies report the use of blinding. All studies were therefore potentially at risk from detection bias because of the absence of blinding, although it is acknowledged that this would be very difficult both to design and implement in trials of red blood cell transfusion. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK> has a more than 50% loss to follow up, with no record of the outcomes in this group. This significantly impacts on the validity of the results in this trial. Neither of the other included studies had any loss to follow up and both reported results on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

Neither of the other two studies reported this as an outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Elizalde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elizalde 1998</LINK> reported an increased hyperdynamic circulation and the authors suggest that this might have led to increased portal pressure and an increased risk of rebleeding.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Red blood cell transfusion in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is common. The UK audit in 2007 found that over 40% of patients presenting acutely to UK hospitals received red blood cell transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Hearnshaw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearnshaw 2008</LINK>). However, the current review found insufficient evidence demonstrating red blood cell transfusion to be effective or safe in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.</P>
<P>The message from the studies in this review is that red blood cell transfusion in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage offers no survival benefit and that there is a trend towards an increased risk of rebleeding and death.</P>
<P>The safety and effectiveness of red blood cell transfusion in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage remains difficult to estimate, and should be the subject of an adequately powered randomised controlled trial.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>The endpoints of the studies we included were not the same as the intended outcome measures of this review, so ascertainment of the mortality data is incomplete. None of the three included studies in the review examined precisely the same range of additional outcomes.</P>
<P>Designing the ideal randomised controlled trial to measure the effect of red blood cell transfusion on mortality in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage would require large numbers of patients. Mortality from upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is around 10%. To identify a 20% relative change in mortality (i.e. from 10% to 8% or 10% to 12%) more than 4000 patients would be needed in each arm of the trial (for 90% power). The only current trial we were able to identify has a target number of 800 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Villanueva" TYPE="STUDY">Villanueva</LINK>). Red blood cell transfusion is used at many stages of the management process and is often prescribed as a response to clinical or laboratory parameters. Consistency in the haemodynamic status and laboratory indices of trial participants prior to intervention would be required to ensure that a specific indication for red blood cell transfusion was tested. In haemodynamically stable patients (those most commonly encountered in clinical practice, as in two of the three trials in this review), a trial of red blood cell transfusion versus intravenous fluid, using haemoglobin transfusion triggers, would be the easiest to conduct. The primary outcome would be all cause mortality, but secondary outcomes such as rebleeding rates, surgery rates, mortality from upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and adverse reactions to transfusion would need to be measured.</P>
<P>Because of the enormous numbers of patients that would be required for a trial to detect significant differences in mortality, another approach would be to choose alternative outcome measures. These could be quality of life outcomes (such as exercise tolerance, time to return to work or standardised quality of life scores) and length of hospital stay, all of which are important outcomes to patients. The effects on quality of life of discharging patients with anaemia following acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage are not known. A randomised clinical trial of red blood cell transfusion (to 'top-up' the haemoglobin concentration for patients with haemoglobin between 8 and 10 g/dL to a discharge haemoglobin of 10 g/dL) versus instituting oral iron therapy (the control arm), and measuring the effect on quality of life and length of stay is one possibility.</P>
<P>The practicalities of randomising and obtaining consent from participants with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is another important issue to consider when designing such a trial. By conducting a cluster randomised trial where hospitals are randomised to follow the trial protocol, this potential problem is reduced. Hospitals would need to agree to accept both protocols and it would be important to measure adherence to the trial protocol in all participating units. This does not reduce the number of participants required to detect significant differences in outcomes. However, by not needing individual participant consent and randomisation, the day to day running of the trial would be easier, and there is potential for more sites to be involved.</P>
<P>Although randomised controlled trials are the gold standard, large case-control studies of red blood cell transfusion in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage would be an alternative, powerful method of investigating a relatively infrequent event such as death. Cautious interpretation would be required, but with accurate data collection and sound methodology, this might be an appropriate next step.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Trial quality across the included studies was variable. The number of patients enrolled was small. In total, 46 patients were available for analysis in the intervention arm in all trials. The largest randomised study enrolled 60 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Villarejo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Villarejo 1999</LINK>), but only reported outcome data on 27 of these (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). None of the studies were appropriately powered and none reported clear primary endpoints for this analysis. The methodological deficiencies, including lack of allocation concealment, generation of random sequences and blinding, compound the uncertainty surrounding analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2002</LINK>) recommend the use of red blood cell transfusion in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage who have a haemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL or when bleeding is extreme as judged by active haematemesis or continuing haematemesis with shock. This review found no reliable evidence to support this recommendation. While it is possible that we have overlooked a large high-quality randomised controlled trial showing that red blood cell transfusion in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is beneficial, this is highly unlikely. To identify eligible trials, over 900 potentially relevant reports were screened, the reference lists of included trials were searched, and the abstracts of over 30 conference proceedings were reviewed.</P>
<P>Death was chosen as the primary outcome measure in this review for two reasons. First, death is a clinically relevant outcome that matters to patients and their physicians. Second, death is not prone to measurement error or reporting bias, which other clinical and laboratory endpoints can be. Only three small and very heterogeneous published trials were identified and reviewed. Mortality data were available for two of the three included trials. The summary relative risk of death was 5.4 (95% confidence interval 0.27 to 107.09) for transfused patients, suggesting a trend towards increased mortality in this group.</P>
<P>Adverse events from transfusion were chosen as the second key outcome measure because red blood cell transfusion carries significant risks to the patient. None of the trials reported any of the commonly reported adverse effects of transfusion. One trial did report increased coagulation times in the transfused group, which the authors argue led to the increased rate of rebleeding reported (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-04 17:25:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effect of red blood cell transfusion as part of resuscitation in haemodynamically unstable patients is also an important question to explore. Early, aggressive fluid resuscitation in trauma patients who are bleeding does not have any clear benefit over delayed resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2003</LINK>). However, in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, deaths are most commonly due to cardiorespiratory comorbidity or complications and only rarely to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage directly (<LINK REF="REF-Rockall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockall 1995</LINK>). The BSG guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation to minimise the risks of cardiorespiratory stress and its associated morbidity/mortality (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2002</LINK>). There is no evidence to date that aggressive resuscitation with red blood cell transfusion in actively bleeding unstable patients confers either benefit or harm. Consequently, an adequately powered randomised controlled clinical trial to address this is also required. This would require randomisation before any resuscitation, which would be logistically challenging. Trials of any versus no fluid resuscitation in trauma patients (who are often young, with little or no medical comorbidity) have demonstrated no benefit of early aggressive resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Bickell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bickell 1994</LINK>). Trials of red blood cell transfusion in acute haemorrhage from trauma similarly demonstrate inconsistent outcomes in transfused patients. A Cochrane Review of fluid administration for patients with bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2003</LINK>) found no evidence to support early versus late or large versus small volume fluid resuscitation. Only two of the studies in the review looked at blood transfusion specifically and neither conferred any benefit from red blood cell transfusion in the acute setting (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortune-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortune 1987</LINK>). How aggressively to institute resuscitation in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is therefore a question that needs to be answered.</P>

<P>We found no clear evidence for benefit or harm of the use red blood cell transfusion in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Red blood cell transfusion in one study was associated with increased mortality, but this was not statistically significant. Potential adverse effects of transfusion on coagulation were reported, but these findings have not been reproduced. Blood supplies are limited throughout the world and no red blood cell transfusion is risk-free. Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is common and we have demonstrated the need for further research.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-08 14:53:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Large, well-concealed randomised controlled trials of sufficient power are urgently needed to establish definitively whether red blood cell transfusion has any clinical benefit with regards to reduction in mortality and rebleeding in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. These trials need also to assess the safety of red blood cell transfusion in these patients, as well as other important outcomes such as length of stay and quality of life measures. A clinical trial of any versus no fluid resuscitation in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is also recommended. Reporting of all new trials should conform to the CONSORT recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>). Updates of this review will include ongoing clinical trials.</P>
