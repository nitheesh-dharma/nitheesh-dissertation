<P>The update of the literature search in September 2007 identified two studies published in abstract form and two ongoing studies. All four were randomized controlled trials of the use of vaginal chlorhexidine in labour to prevent neonatal infection. Neither of the two studies published in abstract form, nor the two ongoing studies have identified maternal colonization with group B streptococcus as an entry criterion. Therefore, no new information was found and our conclusions remain the same as in the original review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-23 17:48:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is no evidence to show that washing the vagina with the antibacterial liquid chlorhexidine or using a chlorhexidine gel during labour reduces group B &#946;-hemolytic streptococcal (GBS) infections in babies.</P>
<P>A woman's vagina normally contains numerous bacteria that generally do not pose any problems to her or her baby. However, occasionally a baby picks up an infection during birth. GBS infection can cause severe illness in babies and rarely a baby may die as a result of the infection. Washing the vagina with chlorhexidine, or applying chlorhexidine gel or cream, during labour was studied in this systematic review as a possible way of reducing infections. The review of four trials included women who were colonized vaginally or rectally with GBS and their 1125 preterm and term infants. It showed that although chlorhexidine may reduce the number of bacteria that pass from the mothers to the babies as the babies pass through the birth canal, or if they suck in (aspirate) contaminated amniotic fluid, the studies were not large enough to say whether chlorhexidine reduced GBS infections or not.</P>
<P>Vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine did not result in a reduction of early-onset GBS illness in the newborns such as sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, or deaths caused by the infection. It may reduce GBS colonization of newborns when compared with mechanical washing with placebo (from one study).</P>
<P>For the comparison chlorhexidine gel or cream versus placebo or no treatment, there were no significant results for the outcomes reported.</P>
<P>Maternal mild side effects such as stinging or local irritation were more common in women treated with chlorhexidine. Different preparations, doses, frequency of dose, and reported outcomes were used. No side effects were reported among the newborns.</P>
<P>The small number of studies that reported on each of the outcomes of interest; and the relatively small sample size (1125 infants), given the low incidence of GBS infection (one to three per 1000 live births) in the general population, meant that the evidence was limited.</P>
<P>There is a need to conduct a large, well-designed randomized trial that examines the efficacy of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine for reducing GBS infection in term and preterm infants and overcomes the methodological limitations of the included studies. Costs associated with treatment with antibiotics and lack of skilled personnel have limited the availability of preventative treatment for women in poorer areas of the world. Chlorhexidine is inexpensive and has no impact on development of antibiotic resistance.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-23 17:48:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although early-onset group B &#946;-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS) infection is rare, it accounts for approximately 30% of neonatal infections, has a high mortality rate, and is acquired through vertical transmission from colonized mothers. Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for preventing early-onset disease (EOD). Vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine during labour has been proposed as another strategy for preventing GBS EOD in the preterm and term neonate. Chlorhexidine has been found to have no impact on antibiotic resistance, is inexpensive, and applicable to poorly equipped delivery sites.</P>

<P>We identified no new trials eligible for inclusion in this update. One study was moved from included to excluded studies from the previous version of the review. Four studies, including 1125 preterm and term infants, met the inclusion criteria and reported on at least one of the outcomes of interest. For the comparison chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel) versus placebo or no treatment, two studies (n = 987) were pooled. There was no statistically significant difference in early-onset GBS disease (sepsis and/or meningitis) comparing chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) versus placebo or no treatment; risk ratio (RR), 2.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 15.63); I-squared (I²) = 0% or in GBS pneumonia; RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.01 to 8.6); test for heterogeneity not applicable. The outcome of colonization of the neonate with GBS was reported in three studies (n = 328); RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.01; there was substantial between-study heterogeneity (Chi² = 3.19; P = 0.20; I² = 37%). Maternal mild side effects (stinging or local irritation) (three trials, 1066 women) were more commonly seen in women treated with chlorhexidine (RR 8.50 (95% CI 1.60 to 45.28); there was no heterogeneity (Chi² = 0.01, df = 1 (P = 0.91); I² = 0%). No side effects were reported among the neonates.</P>
<P>For the comparison chlorhexidine vaginal wash verus mechanical washing with placebo or no treatment (one study, n = 79), there was a significant reduction in neonatal colonization with GBS; RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.90). Tests for heterogeneity not applicable. There were no other significant results for this comparison.</P>
<P>For the comparison chlorhexidine gel or cream versus placebo or no treatment, there were no statistically significant results for the outcomes reported on.</P>
<P>The quality of the trials varied and the overall risk of bias was rated as unclear or high. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was very low for the outcomes of the comparison chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) versus placebo or no treatment. These outcomes included: early-onset GBS disease (sepsis and/or meningitis), GBS pneumonia, neonatal colonization with GBS, neonatal mortality due to early-onset GBS infection and adverse (mild) effects in the mother and the neonate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-03 21:53:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Arne Ohlsson">
<P>The quality of the four included trials varied as did the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence using GRADE was very low. Vaginal chlorhexidine was not associated with reductions in any of the primary outcomes of early-onset GBS disease (sepsis and/or meningitis) or GBS pneumonia. Vaginal chlorhexidine may reduce GBS colonization of neonates. The intervention was associated with an increased risk of maternal mild adverse effects. The review currently does not support the use of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine in labour for preventing early-onset disease. Results should be interpreted with caution as the methodological quality of the studies was poor. As early-onset GBS disease is a rare condition trials with very large sample sizes are needed to assess the effectiveness of vaginal chlorhexidine to reduce its occurrence. In the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, such trials may be difficult to justify especially in developed countries.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-23 17:49:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>During labour an infant may be exposed to a wide spectrum of infectious organisms including group B ß-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS), or <I>Streptococcus agalactiae</I>. The maternal gastrointestinal tract, vagina and urethra serve as reservoirs for GBS. Since the 1970s, GBS has been a leading bacterial cause of illness and death in newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although approximately 15% to 35% of all pregnant women are colonized with GBS in the vagina and/or rectum, approximately 65% of the infants born to GBS positive mothers will be colonized with the bacteria, and approximately one to two infants per 1000 births will become infected (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1998</LINK>). An overview in 1992, reported maternal colonization rates from 19 studies in the years from 1980 to 1991 ranging from 1.6% in Israel, to 28% in England (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1992</LINK>). The transmission rate for GBS colonization from mother to infant varied from 35% in England, to 69% in Brazil. The incidence of early-onset GBS disease varied from 0.2 per 1000 live births in Israel, to 5.0 per 1000 live births in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1992</LINK>). In a systematic review on the prevalence of maternal GBS colonization in European countries, <LINK REF="REF-Barcaite-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barcaite 2008</LINK> identified 21 studies published between 1996 and 2006, that reported on 24,093 women. Group B streptococcus vaginal colonization rates ranged from 6.5% to 36%. The carriage rates were reported to be 19.7% to 29.3% in Eastern Europe, 11% to 21% in Western Europe, 24.3% to 36% in Scandinavia, and 6.5% to 32% in Southern Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Barcaite-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barcaite 2008</LINK>). Similar colonization rates have been found in developing countries (17.8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two forms of GBS disease in infants are well recognized. Early-onset disease (EOD) is defined as isolation of GBS from a normally sterile site (i.e., blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or both) in an infant less than seven days of age with clinical signs compatible with a systemic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1998</LINK>). The three most common clinical presentations include sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis with bacteria present in the blood stream, the lungs and/or around the membranes covering the brain. Preverbal infants cannot report symptoms but clinical signs include; hypo- or hyperthermia, irritability, crying, breathing difficulties, feeding difficulties, neck stiffness, tense fontanel and dehydration. Group B streptococcus EOD accounts for approximately 30% of neonatal infections; has a high mortality rate and is acquired through vertical transmission from colonized mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Freij-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freij 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>). Exposure of the fetus/neonate to the organism can also occur from aspiration of contaminated amniotic fluid leading to invasive disease in some infants. Perinatal transmission can occur through intact membranes or by acquisition during passage through the birth canal (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1999</LINK>). Infants presenting with meningitis may suffer permanent neurological damage including cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, and sensory damage (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Late-onset disease (LOD) usually occurs in infants between one week and up to three months of age, with meningitis being the most common clinical presentation (85% of cases) (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>). Late-onset disease is acquired either by vertical transmission (delayed infection after early colonization) (<LINK REF="REF-Dillon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillon 1987</LINK>), or by horizontal transmission due to cross-infection in the hospital by healthcare workers, or in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Noya-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noya 1987</LINK>). The pathogenesis of LOD is less well understood than EOD (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rapid onset of postnatal disease and its associated high mortality, the morbidity of long-term neurological sequelae among survivors, and the rising cost of comprehensive healthcare to treat GBS infection has led to numerous strategies to prevent EOD (<LINK REF="REF-Adriaanse-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adriaanse 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1999</LINK>). One strategy evaluated extensively over the last two decades is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) with penicillin or alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin or clindamycin (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smaill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 1996</LINK>). The most recent update of the Cochrane review on '<I>Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal Group B streptococcal colonization'</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2014</LINK>) includes three trials (involving 500 women) (<LINK REF="REF-Boyer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matorras-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matorras 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuppurainen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuppurainen 1989</LINK>). The authors conclude that there is lack of evidence from well-designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce EOD (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2014</LINK>). Despite the possible benefits of IAP, increasing antibiotic resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin recommended for women allergic to penicillin is an increasing health concern (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1998</LINK>). In addition, costs associated with treatment have limited the availability of IAP to women in poorer areas of the world. In a review of the relevant cost literature, Benitz and others (<LINK REF="REF-Benitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benitz 1999</LINK>) found that the costs of GBS prevention and treatment ranged from US $9,720 to $22,215 per case prevented.

Chlorhexidine can be applied as a vaginal wash/douching or as a gel/cream application. Chlorhexidine gel is applied around the portio and onto the fornices or by examination gloves lubricated with chlorhexidine cream. Chlorhexidine has been described as a powerful mucous membrane disinfectant, which can result in suppression of GBS organisms.</P>

<P>Christensen and others (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1983</LINK>) found that the minimum inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine for GBS is 0.5 to 1 mg/L. Dykes and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Dykes-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykes 1983</LINK>) demonstrated that chlorhexidine results in a greater than 100-fold reduction of urethral and vaginal counts of the organism in carriers within one hour of application and for a duration of many hours. Chlorhexidine has been found to have no impact on antibiotic resistance, is inexpensive and simple, and applicable to poorly equipped delivery sites (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1999</LINK>). In general, the disinfectant has been associated with only minor adverse effects such as skin rashes and dermatological hypersensitivity reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thune-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thune 1998</LINK>).

<P>Clavisi and others (<LINK REF="REF-Clavisi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavisi 2000</LINK>) conducted a systematic review to examine the efficacy of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine during labour for reducing infection rates and mortality. However, the review did not focus on the efficacy of the intervention for reducing early-onset GBS infection in neonates, but examined the effectiveness of chlorhexidine for reducing all types of infection in both the mother and baby. Six randomized controlled trials and two comparative and not randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were included. The time frame of the search strategy was limited, and included trials from January 1990 to October 1998. The authors concluded that "well designed randomised controlled trials do not support the use of chlorhexidine for reducing postnatal infection rates in mothers and babies" (<LINK REF="REF-Clavisi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavisi 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lumbiganon and co-workers (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2014</LINK>) in a Cochrane review that was updated in Issue 9, 2014, assessed the effectiveness and side effects of chlorhexidine vaginal douching during labour in reducing maternal and neonatal infections (excluding GBS and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). The review is complimentary to the present review. They included three studies (3012 participants) and found no evidence of an effect of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. Although the data suggested a trend in reducing postpartum endometritis, the difference was not statistically significant. The review authors concluded that "there is no evidence to support the use of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections". Although all three included trials were of high quality, one trial used only 20 mL of chlorhexidine or sterile water for vaginal irrigation, while the other two trials used 200 mL of chlorhexidine or sterile saline solution. The effectiveness of vaginal chlorhexidine might depend on the volume of the solution used for irrigation. "There is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial using appropriate concentration and volume of vaginal chlorhexidine irrigation solution and with adequate sample size" (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Goldenberg and co-workers conducted a systematic review to determine the potential for chlorhexidine, used as a vaginal and neonatal wash, to reduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy, especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They summarized the results of every study that they identified (randomized controlled trials and observational studies) in which chlorhexidine was used as a vaginal treatment, with or without wash of the neonate. All pregnancy outcomes except mother-to-child transmission of HIV were included. They found that in developed countries in general, although chlorhexidine when used as a vaginal or newborn disinfectant reduced bacterial load including transmission of GBS from mother to the fetus/infant, it has not been shown to reduce life-threatening maternal or neonatal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They referred to two large non-randomized studies conducted in Malawi (<LINK REF="REF-Taha-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taha 1997</LINK> ) and Egypt (<LINK REF="REF-Bakr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakr 2005</LINK>) that suggested that important reductions in maternal and neonatal sepsis and neonatal mortality may be achievable with vaginal or neonatal chlorhexidine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They concluded that further study of this highly promising treatment is indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current systematic review attempted to overcome the limitations of the earlier reviews, and conforms to the methods and criteria of The Cochrane Collaboration. The aim of this review was to combine all trials (randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials) comparing vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine versus placebo, or to no treatment, to determine the efficacy of the intervention in preventing early-onset GBS infection in preterm and term neonates.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-23 13:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) during labour in women who were colonized with GBS for the prevention of early-onset group B ß-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS) infection in preterm and term neonates.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives were to: 1) describe any benefits or adverse effects to the mother when chlorhexidine was used as a vaginal disinfectant (vaginal wash or gel/cream) during labour, and 2) to describe any adverse effects to the neonate when vaginal chlorhexidine was used.</P>
<P>We carried out a primary analysis of all included trials (vaginal wash or gel/cream versus placebo or no treatment) for the primary and secondary objectives. It was hypothesized that mechanical washing of the vagina during labour, irrespective of the solution used, may result in suppression of GBS. Thus, we conducted comparative analyses a priori to compare the effectiveness of mechanical washing with chlorhexidine to mechanical washing with placebo (saline or water) and of chlorhexidine obstetrical gel/cream versus placebo or no treatment.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We would have explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomized to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analyzed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomized minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-25 13:45:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>We report statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the I-squared (I²) and Chi² statistics using a fixed-effect model. We report heterogeneity as substantial if the I² was greater than 30% and, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. We did not use the random-effects model and therefore we do not report on the Tau² statistic (See <I>Handbook</I> [Section 9.5.4]) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-11-28 15:04:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used the fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would have used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary would have been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we would have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we would not combine trials.</P>
<P>Had we used random-effects analyses, the results would have been presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-12-01 09:18:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we would have investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We would have considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we would have used random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>For the two primary outcomes 'early-onset GBS infection (sepsis and/or meningitis)', and 'pneumonia' within the first seven days of life) there was no substantial (I² &gt; than 30%) heterogeneity and therefore no subgroup analyses were undertaken. The only result with substantial heterogeneity was for the outcome 'Neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days of life' in Comparison 01 Chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) versus placebo or no treatment. Using the fixed-effect model the results were: risk (RR) 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.01); the I² value was 37%. Using the random-effects model the CI widened but the point estimate was essentially the same RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.18); the I² value was 37%. In the discussion section we provide a possible explanation for the heterogeneity in this analysis (See <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>).</P>
<P>In future updates we will attempt to carry out subgroup analyses for analyses with substantial heterogeneity based on how laboratory samples for GBS were collected, handled, plated and analyzed.</P>
<P>We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>

<P>Because of the paucity of included trials no sensitivity analyses were conducted. In the future if more trials become available we will perform sensitivity analyses based on perceived study quality and study location (industrialized versus non-industrialized countries). We will carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, with poor-quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any difference to the overall result.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence was very low (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK> below).</P>
<P>For the main comparison Chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) versus placebo or no treatment (Comparison 01) there were no statistically significant reductions in early-onset GBS sepsis, early-onset GBS pneumonia, early-onset GBS meningitis, neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days of life, or mortality due to early-onset GBS infection. There was no statistically significant between-study heterogeneity for these outcomes. Adverse effects to the mother were statistically significantly higher for the intervention group. The adverse effects were minor: stinging or local irritation. No adverse effects to the infant were noted. There was no statistically significant between-study heterogeneity for any outcomes except for neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days of life (three studies, 328 infants) (I² = 37%). For the comparison Chlorhexidine digluconate gel or cream versus placebo or no treatment (Comparison 03) there was no heterogeneity for the outcome neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days of life (two studies 249 infants). In Comparison 01 <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> the study by <LINK REF="STD-Stray_x002d_Pedersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stray-Pedersen 1999</LINK> appears to be a clear outlier with a significant reduction in neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days of life. In Comparison 02 Chlorhexidine wash versus mechanical washing with placebo or no treatment, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Stray_x002d_Pedersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stray-Pedersen 1999</LINK> is the only study that reports on the outcome and there is a statistically significant reduction in GBS neonatal colonization; RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.90). The heterogeneity noted when all studies are combined could be due to the different methods of administering chlorhexidine or by different methods of obtaining cultures for GBS, or processing the samples.</P>
<P>Vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine did not result in a reduction of early-onset GBS morbidity. This finding may be due to the methodological quality of the studies, particularly the lack of clarity around incidence of morbidity outcomes; the limited number of studies that report on each of the outcomes of interest; and the relatively small sample size (n = 1125 infants) given the low incidence of GBS infection (one to three per 1000 live births) in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1999</LINK>). There is a need to conduct a large, multi-centre, double-blinded randomized trial that examines the efficacy of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine for reducing GBS infection in term and preterm infants and overcomes the methodological limitations of the studies reviewed. Such a study may particularly benefit settings where costs associated with treatment and lack of skilled personnel have limited the availability of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to women in poorer areas of the world.</P>
<P>We examined the effectiveness of vaginal disinfection for the prevention of group B ß-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS) infection in term and preterm infants in this systematic review. The review addressed the limitations of two earlier systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Clavisi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavisi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). Specifically, the current review focused on the efficacy of the intervention for reducing early-onset GBS infection in neonates and did not include other types of neonatal infection; included only randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials; and ensured that the time frame of the search strategy was not limited, but rather extended over 30 years.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-03 21:54:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Arne Ohlsson">
<P>This systematic review includes 1125 infants born to mothers, who were enrolled in trials in four different countries of the world. As early-onset GBS disease is a rare condition in newborn infants very large cohorts of GBS carrier mothers need to be enrolled in trials to be able to ascertain if vaginal chlorhexidine applications do have any impact on the condition or not.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-03 21:54:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Arne Ohlsson">
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials varied. No study was of high quality and elements of bias could not be excluded in any of the studies, mainly due to the fact that information was lacking regarding 'random sequence generation' and 'allocation concealment'. In addition the intervention was performed unblinded to group assignment and there was lack of clarity around blinding of outcomes. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was very low for early-onset neonatal infection, GBS pneumonia within the first seven days, neonatal colonization with GBS within the first seven days and adverse effects in the mother of comparison chlorhexidine (vaginal wash or gel/cream) versus placebo or no treatment. These outcomes were downgraded due to the design limitations and wide confidence interval crossing the line of no effect with few events, or small sample size.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-23 17:53:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In a recent randomized controlled study (n = 108), <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2002</LINK> found similar rates of neonatal GBS colonization when intrapartum ampicillin versus chlorhexidine vaginal flushing was used. This finding suggests the need for further research comparing the effectiveness of chlorhexidine, ampicillin, and placebo or no treatment for reduction of neonatal GBS colonization.</P>
<P>Clavisi and others (<LINK REF="REF-Clavisi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavisi 2000</LINK>) conducted a systematic review to examine the efficacy of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine during labour for reducing infection rates and mortality. However, the review did not focus on the efficacy of the intervention for reducing early-onset GBS infection in neonates, but examined the effectiveness of chlorhexidine for reducing all types of infection in both the mother and baby. Six randomized controlled trials and two comparative and not randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were included. The time frame of the search strategy was limited, and included trials from January 1990 to October 1998. The authors concluded that "well designed randomised controlled trials do not support the use of chlorhexidine for reducing postnatal infection rates in mothers and babies" (<LINK REF="REF-Clavisi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavisi 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a Cochrane review that excluded GBS and HIV infections Lubiganon and co-workers (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2014</LINK>) found no evidence to support the use of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. They concluded like we did that there is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial using appropriate concentration and volume of vaginal chlorhexidine irrigation solution and with an adequate sample size.</P>
<P>Goldenberg and co-workers conducted a systematic review to determine the potential for chlorhexidine, used as a vaginal and neonatal wash, to reduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy, especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They summarized the results of every study that they identified (randomized controlled trials and observational studies) in which chlorhexidine was used as a vaginal treatment, with or without wash of the neonate. All pregnancy outcomes except mother-to-child transmission of HIV were included. They found that in developed countries in general, although chlorhexidine when used as a vaginal or newborn disinfectant reduced bacterial load including transmission of GBS from mother to the fetus/infant, it has not been shown to reduce life-threatening maternal or neonatal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They referred to two large non-randomized studies conducted in Malawi (<LINK REF="REF-Taha-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taha 1997</LINK>) and Egypt (<LINK REF="REF-Bakr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakr 2005</LINK>) that suggested that important reductions in maternal and neonatal sepsis and neonatal mortality may be achievable with vaginal or neonatal chlorhexidine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>). They concluded that further study of this highly promising treatment is indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-23 17:53:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This update of the review did not identify any additional eligible trials. The results of the review are based on few trials of variable quality and small sample sizes given the low incidence of invasive early-onset GBS disease. Vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine resulted in a possible reduction in group B ß-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS) colonization of neonates, but was not associated with reductions in other important outcomes: early-onset GBS disease (sepsis and/or meningitis), early-onset GBS pneumonia, or mortality. The intervention was associated with an increased risk of maternal (mild) adverse effects. Thus, the review currently does not support the use of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine in labour for the prevention of early-onset GBS morbidity in preterm and term infants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-03 21:54:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Arne Ohlsson">
<P>The results of this updated systematic review suggest the need for further research. As early-onset GBS disease is a rare condition trials with very large sample sizes are needed to assess the effectiveness of vaginal chlorhexidine to reduce its occurrence. In the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, such a trial may be difficult to justify especially in developed countries. Trials of vaginal chlorhexidine in low-resource countries where intrapartum antibiotics are not administered may be reasonable to undertake. Acknowledging the increasing concern regarding drug-resistant bacteria such trials may be justified in developed countries too.</P>

<P>The original review and this update were undertaken by three review authors, all of whom are content experts. One review author conducted the literature search. The studies that were found as a result of the search strategy described earlier were screened by two of the review authors, discarding the studies that were clearly ineligible but aiming to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. We evaluated trials under consideration for methodological quality using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Blinding of randomization, intervention and outcome measurement, and completeness of follow-up were ranked as Grade A: adequate; Grade B: uncertain; Grade C: inadequate. Two review authors conducted independent assessments to determine whether the studies met the inclusion criteria, with disagreement resolved by discussion. When discussion was not enough to resolve the disagreement, we referred the matter to the third review author.</P>
<P>The two review authors then independently abstracted information from the results sections of the included studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion or referral to the third review author. One review author checked and entered the data. Where possible, we sought missing data from the authors.</P>
<P>We performed statistical analyses for dichotomous data using relative risk, and 95% confidence intervals. We calculated the risk difference and reported the numbers needed to treat to benefit and number needed to harm. We used a chi-square test and the I-squared analysis to test for heterogeneity, and applied a fixed- or random-effects model accordingly. We conducted subgroup analysis to compare the effectiveness of vaginal washing with chlorhexidine versus vaginal washing with placebo (saline or water). We conducted a subgroup analysis based on methods of chlorhexidine administration and preparation (vaginal washing with chlorhexidine acetate/diacetate versus application of chlorhexidine digluconate gel or cream) to check for heterogeneity across studies or to examine sensitivity of combined results, or both.</P>
