<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Still awaiting evidence for effect of ursodeoxycholic acid and/or antibiotics in the prevention of biliary stent occlusion</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Malignant occlusion of the biliary tract can be relieved by insertion of a stent, which allows passage of the biliary fluid. However, stents often clog. This Review examines if ursodeoxycholic acid (a bile acid) and/or antibiotics may prevent clogging of biliary stents. At present there is not sufficient evidence to recommend ursodeoxycholic acid and/or antibiotics for biliary stented patients.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Malignant biliary obstruction, which requires endoscopic stenting as palliative therapy, is often complicated by clogging of the stent with subsequent jaundice and/or cholangitis. Stent clogging may be caused by microbiological adhesion and biliary stasis. Therefore, antibiotics and choleretic agents like ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) have been investigated to see whether they prolong stent patency.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate if UDCA and/or antibiotics may prolong stent patency and survival in patients with strictures of the biliary tract and endoscopically inserted stents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>Current Contents</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>, and <I>CancerLit</I> were searched until June 2001. Reference lists of the identified articles were checked for further trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials investigating UDCA and/or antibiotics in patients with biliary stents were considered for inclusion, regardless of blinding, language, and publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial inclusion, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Principal investigators were contacted for further information. Survival data were combined by using hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval (95% CI)).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five non-blinded randomised trials with 258 patients with malignant strictures treated with polyethylene stents were included. Three trials, including 152 patients, investigated a combination of UDCA and antibiotics versus no treatment. The meta-analysis of these three trials does not show a significant treatment effect on the duration of stent patency (hazard ratio (random effects model) 0.58, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.54) or mortality (hazard ratio (fixed effect model) 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Two trials with 106 patients compared antibiotics with no treatment, one of these trials used a combination of antibiotics and rowachol (an 'alternative' drug of the 'mint' family). The pooled results of these two trials do not show significant effects of antibiotics on the duration of stent patency (hazard ratio (fixed effect model) 0.69 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.30)) or mortality (hazard ratio (fixed effect model) 1.23 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.08). Data concerning duration of hospital stay, frequency of cholangitis, and rate of infectious complications due to selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria strains were not available.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Treatment with UDCA and/or antibiotics to prevent clogging of biliary stents in patients with malignant stricture of the biliary tract cannot be recommended routinely on the basis of the existing randomised clinical trials. Further trials are needed with rigorous methodology and sufficient statistical power. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Stenoses of the biliary tract cause major problems in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary carcinoma, or other malignant disorders where the bile duct is compressed by the primary tumour or metastases. When a surgical cure is not attainable, endoscopic stenting is the preferred palliative procedure for patients with bile duct stenosis of malignant origin (<LINK REF="REF-Hagenmuller-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagenmuller 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huibregtse-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huibregtse 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>). Compared with bile duct surgery, endoscopically placed stents are less invasive and seems to achieve similar median survival times (Andersen 1989). In addition, some benign causes of cholestasis (e.g., bile duct strictures due to primary sclerosing cholangitis) require the insertion of biliary stents. </P>
<P>The major drawback of biliary stents is the occlusion of the prostheses with recurrence of jaundice and/or cholangitis. Stent clogging usually occurs 20 to 30 weeks after insertion when polyethylene stents are used (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1989</LINK>). Self expanding metal stents reach significantly longer periods of patency, but their use is limited because of high costs (about 20 times more expensive than polyethylene stents) (<LINK REF="STD-Davids-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davids 1992</LINK>). In fact, fewer ERCP-investigations would be necessary if metal stents are used and this may outweigh the higher price of the prosthesis (particularly in patients with good clinical performance status and a life expectancy of at least six months).</P>
<P>There is evidence that stent clogging is caused by microbiological adhesion and biliary stasis leading to encrustation of the bile components (<LINK REF="REF-Groen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leung-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moesch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moesch 1991</LINK>). As a consequence of these findings it was hypothesised that antibacterial and choleretic agents could delay the occlusion of biliary stents. In an animal model, Libby et al. were able to reach four times longer periods of stent patency by administration of ciprofloxacin (<LINK REF="REF-Libby-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libby 1996</LINK>). Some randomised trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of the administration of antibiotics alone or in combination with choleretic agents like ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on the duration of stent patency in patients with malignant diseases leading to compression of the biliary tract (<LINK REF="STD-Barrioz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Barrioz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Luman 1999</LINK>). However, the evidence has not yet been systematically reviewed and the effect of these interventions on clinically relevant outcomes is not clear. The aim of this systematic Review was to evaluate this evidence and to integrate these findings in a comprehensive evaluation of these interventions.</P>

<P>This strategy was combined with the highly sensitive search strategy (HSSS) developed by Dickersin et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>). The Controlled Trials Register of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group and The Cochrane Library were searched without the HSSS.</P>

In databases which provide a controlled vocabulary (e.g., <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>) the free text-search was combined with a comparable search strategy adapted to the thesaurus of the database.

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The systematic Review and its meta-analysis were performed according to the formerly published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Galandi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galandi 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial selection<BR/>One reviewer (DG) collected the complete publication of all citations that seem to be clearly or potentially relevant trials for this Review. Based on the full text of the trial two reviewers (DG and GS) independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were solved by discussion and by asking a third party (HPA).</P>
<P>Quality assessment<BR/>All trials included in the Review were assessed for their methodological quality. Two reviewers (DG and GS) independently assessed the trial quality and disagreements were solved by discussion, and if necessary by asking a third party (HPA).</P>
<P>Quality was assessed according to the 0-5 point Jadad scale described below (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Additionally, data about concealment of treatment allocation was collected (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Jadad scale: <BR/>1 point for randomisation of trial participants;<BR/>1 point for description of an adequate method for generation of the randomised sequence;<BR/>1 point for double blinding;<BR/>1 point for description of an adequate blinding method;<BR/>1 point for description of drop outs and withdrawals.</P>
<P>(If the randomisation or blinding method is described but inadequate, one point was deducted.)</P>
<P>According to allocation concealment the trials were classified as follows:</P>
<P>a) Adequate method of allocation concealment;<BR/>b) Uncertain because of lacking data;<BR/>c) Inadequate method of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Two reviewers (DG and GS) independently extracted the complete data from all included trials. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Principal authors of the trials were contacted to retrieve missing data.<BR/>
<BR/>Statistical analyses<BR/>Analyses were conducted with The Cochrane Collaboration's software package (RevMan 4.1). Additional analyses (like hazard ratios to combine survival data), which cannot be calculated with RevMan 4.1, were conducted using the STATA software package (StataCorp. 2001. Stata statistical software: Release 7.0. College station, TX: Stata Corporation).</P>
<P>The analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. All patients were analysed as randomised, and missing patient data for binary outcomes were considered as failures. In case of lacking data on the outcome of excluded patients, the principal author was asked to provide the original data in order to perform an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between trials was analysed by a Chi-squared test; a P-value of &lt; 0.1 was considered significant. In the case of statistical heterogeneity between trials, a random effects model was used (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Potential causes of heterogeneity were explored by performing sensitivity analyses if possible. When there was no evidence for heterogeneity, the data were analysed using a fixed effect model. Hazard ratios were used to combine survival data (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The presence of bias (e.g., publication bias) was investigated by a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, a rank correlation test was conducted, a P-value of &lt; 0.1 was considered significant (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Using the described search methods, we identified five trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of this Review with a total of 258 patients (range 20 to 70 patients per trial). All were randomised, non-blinded trials that were investigating patients with malignant biliary stricture and endoscopically inserted polyethylene stents. All trials compared the investigated treatment versus a no treatment-control group. No quasi-randomised studies have been identified.</P>
<P>Three trials investigated a combination of UDCA and an antibiotic (two trials used norfloxacin, in the third trial monthly cycles of ampicillin, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin were used). Two trials compared an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) versus no treatment. In one of these trials, ciprofloxacin was combined with rowachol (contains chemicals from several members of the 'mint family' and has been used as an 'alternative treatment' for gallstones). We decided to include this trial in the analysis as well since there was no significant heterogeneity in the outcomes of the trials and we know of no randomised trials demonstrating the efficacy of rowachol.</P>
<P>The main outcome of all trials was the duration of stent patency. Mortality was the secondary outcome in all trials but Barrioz et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Barrioz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Barrioz 1994</LINK>), which did not report sufficient data to extract hazard ratios for mortality nor did they answer our query concerning additional information about this outcome. The Barrioz et al. trial provided some information with respect to the length of hospital stay. </P>
<P>Concerning the other investigated outcomes of this Review (frequency of cholangitis and the selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria strains) no data were available. Data about costs or quality of life were also missing.</P>
<P>Except Sung et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1999</LINK>), none of the investigators responded to our queries, therefore, the analysis is based on the published information of the remaining trials.</P>
<P>The distribution of the trials in the funnel plot does not show evidence of publication bias or other biases. Due to the small number of trials in this Review the power of this test is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2000</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The identified trials were of intermediate to weak methological quality. All trials were described as randomised trials but none of them gave adequate description on how the allocation sequence was generated and only three trials gave detailed information about the method of allocation concealment (sealed envelopes) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Ledinghen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Ledinghen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Luman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1999</LINK>). No trial described the sealed envelopes as 'opaque'. All trials were non-blinded although blinding would have been possible. Information about dropouts or losses to follow up was given in four trials.</P>
<P>Assessed by the Jadad-scale, the trials obtained 1 to 3 points on the 5 point scale (see table 'Characteristics of included studies').</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>UDCA plus antibiotics versus no intervention<BR/>Three trials could be identified investigating this comparison. The trial of Barrioz et al., although very small, with only 10 patients in each group, reports a statistically significant benefit of the drug combination with respect to median stent patency and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Barrioz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Barrioz 1994</LINK>). The remaining two trials (with 29-39 patients in each treatment group) did not identify any positive effect of the investigated therapy on these two outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-De-Ledinghen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Ledinghen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 1994</LINK>). Thus the test of heterogeneity showed evidence for statistical heterogeneity (Chi-square-test 7.68, P = 0.022) and we decided to combine these trials using a random effects model (as planned in the protocol of this Review). The hazard ratio for stent occlusion calculated on the basis of the three trials in the random effects model is 0.58 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.54), P = 0.27. The analysis does not show a significant extension of stent patency in patients treated with UDCA plus antibiotics versus no intervention. The random effects analysis of the hazard ratios cannot be displayed by MetaView but the results of the single trials are presented.</P>
<P>With regard to mortality the data given by Barrioz et al. were not sufficient to be included in the meta-analysis. Neither the report of the trial gives information which would allow the calculation of hazard ratios nor the investigators replied to our inquiry. The meta-analysis is based on the remaining two trials (132 patients) only and showed no significant difference between the survival of the two groups: hazard ratio 0.99 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.43) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Ledinghen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Ledinghen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antibiotics versus no intervention</P>
<P>Two trials with 106 patients were identified which investigated this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Luman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Luman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1999</LINK>). There was no evidence for heterogeneity within these two trials (Chi-square-test 0.65, P = 0.42) so we combined the trials using a fixed effect model. With respect to the duration of stent patency, the meta-analysis results in a hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.30) which does not indicate a significant difference in duration of stent patency between the treatment and the control group.</P>
<P>With respect to mortality, the two trials do not show a significant difference between treatment and control group: hazard ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.08).</P>
<P>We were not able to find any trial investigating the following comparisons:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>UDCA versus placebo or no intervention</LI>
<LI>UDCA versus antibiotics</LI>
<LI>UDCA and antibiotics versus UDCA alone</LI>
<LI>UDCA and antibiotics versus antibiotics alone.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Data concerning duration of hospital stay, frequency of cholangitis, and rate of infectious complications due to selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria strains were not available.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis according to stent material (metal versus plastic), cause of jaundice (malignant versus others), or the impact of different plastic stent material on the basis of the identified data were not feasible, because all identified trials investigated patients with malignant cause of jaundice treated with polyethylene stents.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses according to method of allocation concealment, blinding, and randomisation (randomised trials versus quasi-randomised ) could not be conducted because all of the included five trials were randomised, open trials with unclear allocation concealment.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although almost every patient with an endoscopically inserted polyethylene stent for the treatment of a malignant biliary stricture experiences a relapse of jaundice and/or cholangitis, only five randomised trials evaluating UDCA and/or antibiotics as prevention of early stent occlusion could be identified. Furthermore, these trials are small with a maximum of 70 patients per trial. Four of these trials did not show a significant effect of the treatment on the duration of stent patency and survival. The remaining trial has to be interpreted with caution because this very small trial has some serious limitations like a very short time of stent patency in the control group and evidence of unbalanced randomisation of patients due to the small number of participants. Cholangiocarcinoma was most common in the active treatment group. This unbalanced distribution of malignancies between the two intervention groups may explain the longer survival in the active treatment group because cholangiocarcinoma show a rather slow progression when compared to pancreatic carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Nagakawa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagakawa 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Investigating the cause of heterogeneity in the comparison 'UDCA and antibiotics versus no intervention', it must be recognised that a very short duration of stent patency was observed in the control group of the trial of Barrioz et al. with a median time of stent patency of six weeks for the first stent and seven weeks for all stents. This is clearly a shorter patency time than in all other trials which gave information about the duration of stent patency in the untreated group of patients. Ghosh et al. report a median time to stent occlusion of 28 weeks and De Ledinghen et al. of 21 weeks in the control group.<BR/>
<BR/>Patients with polyethylene stents may potentially be helped by undergoing routine changes of the stent before cholangitis or jaundice reappear. An appropriate interval could be three months, which is below the median time to stent occlusion reported in the identified RCTs. However, we need high quality randomised trials examining the beneficial and harmful effects of such a strategy. Patients in good clinical status and a life expectancy of more than six months may be potentially helped by the insertion of metal stents that tend to stay patent a longer time as demonstrated in a RCT comparing metal and polyethylene stents (<LINK REF="STD-Davids-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davids 1992</LINK>). However, we also need more high quality RCTs on beneficial and harmful effects of metal stents.</P>
<P>The systematic Review and meta-analyses of the five included trials do not show any significant effect of antibiotics alone or in combination with UDCA on the duration of stent patency or survival.</P>
<P>On the basis of the existing evidence a clinically relevant treatment effect cannot be precluded.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the basis of the trials pooled in this systematic Review, prophylactic treatment with UDCA and/or antibiotics to prevent clogging of polyethylene stents in patients with malignant biliary strictures cannot be recommended routinely. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further properly designed RCTs with sufficient statistical power should be initiated to evaluate the use of ursodeoxycholic acid and/or antibiotics in patients with endoscopically inserted biliary stents in the treatment of biliary strictures and such RCTs should stratify patients at randomisation according to the cause of stricture. Additionally, new substances should be considered for this indication since it is to be expected that UDCA and/or antibiotics are not able to prevent stent clogging completely. Furthermore, future trials should also provide data concerning additional, clinically relevant aspects like duration of hospital stay, frequency of cholangitis, and rate of infectious complications due to selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria strains. The use of metal stents should be investigated to identify situations in which these stents with longer patency times may be superior to plastic stents.</P>
