<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the available evidence regarding occlusion treatment for stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) with respect to vision at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Amblyopia or 'lazy eye' occurs when vision does not develop normally in early childhood. Stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA), the type that occurs due to blockage of vision in the eye, for example by a cloudy lens or droopy eyelid, or unequal refractive error in the two eyes (unequal focus of the images, for example one eye is nearsighted and the other eye is farsighted). Eye doctors consider this type of amblyopia to be the most difficult to treat successfully. Although about 1% to 5% of people have some type of amblyopia, SDA is much less common, about 3% of all people with any type of amblyopia. Usually SDA is diagnosed after parents observe a whitish pupil or a droopy eyelid before a baby's first birthday. SDA is often diagnosed after the problem causing these signs is treated and refractive correction (for example, wearing spectacles) is prescribed.</P>
<P>The goal of treatment of SDA is to improve vision in the affected eye and to provide stereopsis, that is, '3-D' vision and depth perception. Treatment may last for several months in order to assure that the affected eye gains as much vision as possible. Also, participation in sports and future employment may be affected by poor vision in one eye or loss of 3-D vision. A common treatment is to occlude or cover the unaffected eye, often with an adhesive patch, in order to force the amblyopic eye to be used. Because young children find occlusion confusing or uncomfortable, occlusion therapy may be difficult for their parents to implement.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no randomized controlled trials (trials in which participants are randomly assigned to one treatment group or another) that evaluated the effectiveness of occlusion therapy for SDA. Thus, well-designed research studies of SDA are needed before we have the information we need to make treatment decisions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-23 05:25:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) develops due to an obstruction to the passage of light secondary to a condition such as cataract. The obstruction prevents formation of a clear image on the retina. SDA can be resistant to treatment, leading to poor visual prognosis. SDA probably constitutes less than 3% of all amblyopia cases, although precise estimates of prevalence are unknown. In developed countries, most patients present under the age of one year; in less developed parts of the world patients are likely to be older at the time of presentation. The mainstay of treatment is removal of the cataract and then occlusion of the better-seeing eye, but regimens vary, can be difficult to execute, and traditionally are believed to lead to disappointing results.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-23 05:28:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of occlusion therapy for SDA in an attempt to establish realistic treatment outcomes. Where data were available, we also planned to examine evidence of any dose response effect and to assess the effect of the duration, severity, and causative factor on the size and direction of the treatment effect.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-23 10:20:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:48:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term 'amblyopia' refers to bluntness of vision and is derived from the Greek words "amblys" (meaning blunt) and "ops" (meaning eye). Clinically, amblyopia denotes a reduction in vision in the absence of any retinal anomaly or any disorder of the afferent visual pathways (<LINK REF="REF-Duke_x002d_Elder-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duke-Elder 1973</LINK>). Amblyopia typically affects only one eye but it sometimes affects both eyes. Amblyopia is usually classified according to its cause:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>strabismic, caused by squint (eye misalignment);</LI>
<LI>anisometropic, caused by unequal refractive (focusing) error;</LI>
<LI>meridional, caused by astigmatism (irregular corneal curvature);</LI>
<LI>ammetropic, caused by high refractive error in both eyes;</LI>
<LI>stimulus deprivation, caused by an obstruction in the visual pathway.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Mixed amblyopia, which is a result of more than one cause, is typically due to a combination of strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia. This review is focused on interventions for stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA), also called amblyopia ex anopsia. Other Cochrane reviews have evaluated interventions for strabismic and anisometropic (refractive) amblyopia (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>Visual experiences in early life determine the organization of the portion of the adult brain that processes visual stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesel-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesel 1963</LINK>). The time within which abnormal visual input can lead to a disruption of the normal pattern of development is called the 'critical period' (<LINK REF="REF-Hockfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hockfield 1998</LINK>). There are several critical periods, each associated with different visual functions (<LINK REF="REF-Harwerth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harwerth 1990</LINK>), which probably reflect development of different parts of the brain. These critical periods can be considered as a continuum from extreme sensitivity to almost no sensitivity to external stimuli. Amblyopia begins to develop in these critical periods at young ages when the brain and the visual system are immature and connections between neurons are still being formed and stabilized. During the critical period, most amblyopia is reversible, usually until the child is 10 years old (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2002</LINK>). The critical period varies considerably among children and depends on the type of amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Etiology</HEADING>
<P>Patients with SDA lose vision from disuse or lack of formation of clear retinal images, most commonly as a result of one of the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>unoperated infantile cataract (opacity of the lens);</LI>
<LI>ptosis (droopy eyelids) (<LINK REF="REF-Dray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dray 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gusek_x002d_Schneider--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gusek-Schneider 2000</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>hemangioma (blood-rich swelling on the lid) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1982</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>obstruction in the vitreous (clear gel that fills the eye), for example due to bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrone-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrone 1994</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>aphakia (absence of the natural lens);</LI>
<LI>occlusion prescribed to treat amblyopia of the other eye (<LINK REF="REF-Awaya-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awaya 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Noorden-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Noorden 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Noorden-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Noorden 1981</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patients with SDA may have either otherwise healthy eyes or other co-existing conditions, such as microphthalmos (small eye), coloboma (incomplete formation of the eye), optic nerve hypoplasia (under-developed optic nerve), or retinal abnormalities. Co-existing conditions often limit the visual prognosis. It is difficult to discern whether the visual loss is due to SDA or due to other co-existing conditions in the eye.</P>
<P>The most commonly reported cause of SDA is congenital or infantile cataract in one eye. Stimulus deprivation secondary to the cataract continues until the cataract is removed and optical correction is provided. Even after optical correction, the affected eye may continue to be anisometropic and anisekonic (forming unequal image sizes) (<LINK REF="REF-Enoch-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enoch 1983</LINK>). The early insult to the visual system is believed to make this type of amblyopia particularly severe and resistant to treatment. The visual prognosis has been reported to be poor (<LINK REF="REF-Kanski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanski 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The prevalence of amblyopia in the general population ranges from 1% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillis 1983</LINK>). In European children, the prevalence ranges from 1% to 2.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Kvarnstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvarnstrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2000</LINK>). Amblyopia accounts for 29% of unilateral blindness in Copenhagen (<LINK REF="REF-Buch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buch 2001</LINK>) and as much as 8.3% of bilateral blindness in India following childhood cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2003</LINK>). SDA accounts for less than 3% of amblyopic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hillis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillis 1983</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation</HEADING>
<P>Routine health checks of babies and toddlers are carried out by a variety of health care personnel (for example, pediatricians, nurses) and provide an opportunity for detection of the causative factors (for example, ptosis, cataract) associated with SDA. SDA itself is not likely to be noticed, but parents may detect the signs associated with causes of SDA such as leukocoria (white pupils) in children with congenital cataracts or droopy eyelid (ptosis). Children may also present with squint (misalignment) as a result of poor vision in one eye. In the developed world, most patients with SDA present for treatment while they are under the age of one (<LINK REF="REF-Mein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mein 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>There are four main steps in the diagnosis of SDA.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Visual acuity testing: testing young children largely relies on objective observations that are limited by cognition and concentration. Qualitative methods (e.g., assessing fixation preference) may be used, however quantitative tests (e.g., preferential looking) are more precise. Preferential looking tests rely on the observation that infants prefer to look at patterned rather than plain surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Fanz-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanz 1958</LINK>). Children look at a striped panel when they can discern it. A Snellen equivalent can then be computed using the degree of visual angle subtended by the stripes in the panel. In older children, testing methods are more objective and rely on the child's identification of pictoral or letter optotypes in Snellen, decimal or logMAR notation.</LI>
<LI>External and internal eye examination to identify any co-existing conditions: the examination must focus on identifying lesions such as optic nerve hypoplasia that could lead to inappropriate or unsuccessful treatment of the condition.</LI>
<LI>Cycloplegic refraction and corrective prescription when indicated: amblyopia can be diagnosed only after correcting any significant refractive error.</LI>
<LI>Rechecking visual acuity with any prescribed refractive correction in place: some improvement in visual acuity can be expected with refractive correction alone. There should be a period of adjustment to spectacles before retesting. Traditionally this adjustment period has been four to six weeks, but studies on refractive and strabismic amblyopia show this period may be as long as 24 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Definitions of amblyopia vary largely due to the fact that there is little evidence as to what constitutes normal vision at different ages based on successful performances on many commonly used tests. Amblyopia may be defined by comparing both eyes (inter-ocular difference) or by looking at monocular visual acuity alone. We have elected to define amblyopia as vision worse than 6/9 on a Snellen-based test, 0.2 LogMAR or its equivalent in one eye. Assuming that the fellow eye has normal vision, that is 6/6 or logMAR 0.0, this definition means that the difference in vision between the two eyes is greater than 0.2 log MAR.</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:50:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Visual loss due to SDA can be difficult to quantify due to the limitations of the visual acuity tests available for young children but is believed to be severe in most cases. The aim of treatment is to maximize visual recovery without adversely affecting acuity in the better-seeing eye. The rationale for treatment is two-fold, to provide a good second eye should the better-seeing eye ever be visually compromised; and to maximize stereopsis (binocular co-operation between the eyes). Untreated or unsuccessfully treated amblyopia may affect adult life. For individuals with amblyopia, the lifetime risk of serious visual impairment due to loss or damage of the better-seeing eye is estimated to be between 1.2% and 3.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Rahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahi 2002</LINK>). In addition, there are implications for employment prospects and, therefore, income. The number of jobs barred to individuals with reduced vision increases with the severity of the deficit (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>). Futhermore, stereopsis is required to participate in many sports and for some jobs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stages of treatment</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>The first stage is to correct any factor degrading the quality of the visual image (e.g., infantile cataract extraction, ptosis repair). In cases of early unilateral deprivation, correction must be undertaken in the first eight to 12 weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Birch-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birch-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanski 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The second stage is to provide necessary refractive correction to maximize the quality of visual stimulation received by the child's amblyopic eye. Intraocular implants, contact lenses or both may be used after cataract surgery.</LI>
<LI>The third stage is occlusion therapy. Occlusion of the unaffected eye forces the use of the amblyopic eye to stimulate the formation of functional connections in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Boothe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boothe 2000</LINK>).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Occlusion regimen</HEADING>
<P>Protocols and practices for occlusion therapy vary considerably. Typically, occlusion therapy ranges in duration from an hour to more than six hours (full-time). Factors affecting the prescribed amount of occlusion include the level of visual deficit, the age of the child and the likely waiting time to the next appointment. Follow-up is recommended at intervals of one week per year of age during periods of aggressive patching (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1987</LINK>). Occlusion may be stopped when visual acuity becomes equal in the two eyes or if no progress has been made after three months of good compliance with occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 2001</LINK>). Children may require monitoring until they reach the age of visual maturity (approximately seven years of age) to ensure that amblyopia does not recur. Some periods of maintenance occlusion may be required during that time (<LINK REF="REF-Mein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mein 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following have been used as additions to occlusion therapy, but are not currently popular clinically.</P>
<OL>
<LI>CAM visual stimulator: uses rotating high-contrast square wave gratings to stimulate the amblyopic eye.</LI>
<LI>Pleoptics: employs after-images to encourage foveal fixation and normal projection in the amblyopic eye.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of occlusion</HEADING>
<P>Atropine penalization and optical penalization (patching or use of lenses to reduce the acuity) are forms of occlusion that encourage use of the amblyopic eye by diminishing visual form. These treatments for amblyopia were evaluated in another Cochrane review, which showed that atropine penalization is as effective as conventional occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK>). Total occlusion is not without disadvantages in terms of discomfort, but it is relatively easy to control the dosage of treatment and is without the more complex side effects of alternatives such as occlusive contact lenses.</P>

<P>In order to quantify amblyopia, visual acuity must be measured. Qualitative methods for assessing vision in preverbal children are based on the observation of their fixation patterns. These methods are often unreliable and require highly trained examiners (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zipf-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipf 1976</LINK>). Visual acuity assessed using an age-appropriate test (<LINK REF="REF-Fulton-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sebris-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebris 1987</LINK>) is the most commonly used outcome to evaluate treatment for amblyopia. Tests vary in the use of optotypes (pictures, letters, or symbols), presented with or without crowding. Crowded visual acuity tests are harder to perform but are more sensitive to amblyopia than uncrowded tests.</P>
<P>Developmental changes in young children complicate the evaluation of actual change in visual acuity before and after treatment. Alternative methods of measuring change have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>), but we aimed to compare post-treatment visual acuity levels (defining restoration of normal visual acuity as better than or equal to 6/9 on Snellen, or 0.2 LogMAR or its equivalent).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Factors affecting outcome</HEADING>
<P>Compliance with therapy is critical for successful treatment but often can be difficult to achieve. Young children can become distressed by being restricted to reduced visual acuity and from the discomfort of wearing an adhesive patch. It has been suggested that, if possible, compliance should be monitored to measure its affect on the response to treatment. Devices to objectively measure compliance have been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Awan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2005</LINK>) but are not in common use; typically clinicians depend on parental reports. Other factors believed to affect treatment success are the duration of visual deprivation, the age at onset and timing of initiation of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Maurer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurer 1989</LINK>); early onset of amblyopia, long duration of the condition and late initiation of therapy are associated with worse visual prognosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Harm from occlusion therapy</HEADING>
<P>Potential adverse effects from occlusion therapy include inducing amblyopia in the occluded eye, skin allergies, infections or corneal abrasions from contact lens wear, diplopia (double vision) and psychological effects on the parents and children (for example, distress).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-23 10:20:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reported success of treatment for SDA varies. Studies have reported good levels of vision following early treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gregg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 1994</LINK>) but there is a lack of standardization and poor agreement among experts as to the optimum amount of occlusion needed to achieve a good visual outcome. Commencing occlusion therapy in infants with very poor vision can be harrowing for the parents and stressful for the child. Realistic treatment goals are often poorly defined. It is thus necessary to establish the most effective occlusion regimen(s) for stimulus deprivation amblyopia and to define the degree of improvement that can reasonably be expected from this treatment.</P>

<P>The electronic searches conducted in 2004 identified 799 abstracts and titles of which seven appeared to be randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for amblyopia. Of these, three trials evaluated conventional occlusion therapy but did not include patients with SDA (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Repka-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Repka 2003</LINK>). There were four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Keith-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Keith 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehdorn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Mehdorn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nyman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nyman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tytla-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Tytla 1981</LINK>) on the CAM visual stimulator but after reading the full-texts of the studies and contacting the authors, where necessary, it became apparent that only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nyman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nyman 1983</LINK>) had included participants with SDA and the data relevant to this review were no longer available. All seven trials were therefore excluded (<I>see </I>table: <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Full text copies of 25 additional references were obtained because the initial search information was insufficient to establish whether the studies were eligible for inclusion, either because only the title was available, the abstract was unclear, or the abstract or study was written in a language other than English. After further perusal or translation, all studies were found to be ineligible and were excluded. Reasons for exclusion have been documented (<I>see </I>table: <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>An updated search was done in November 2007 which yielded an additional 53 reports of studies. One RCT including five patients with SDA was found, but it had investigated the effectiveness of an educational program on the predictors of noncompliance to occlusion therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Loudon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Loudon 2006</LINK>). Five additional RCTs investigated occlusion therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hertle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hertle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Repka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Repka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stankovic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stankovic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2006</LINK>) but these included only strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia, or both. Thus, the search did not identify any new trials which met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>
<P>The latest search was conducted in October 2013, which identified 954 additional titles and abstracts and 256 records from trial registers (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). After review of the records, we assessed 930 titles and abstracts and all trial register records as 'definitely exclude, and 24 as unsure. Five of the 24 references that were assessed as unsure were editorials or commentories that did not report original data and were excluded. We retrieved the remaining 19 full-text articles and further examined their eligibility.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-23 11:01:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We did not find any RCT that had evaluated the effects of occlusion or any other treatment for SDA, highlighting a gap in the evidence and the need for rigorous studies to address this question. Because SDA is generally accepted to be more severe and resistant to treatment compared with amblyopia due to other causes, participants with SDA have been excluded from existing RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Kanski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanski 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Because of co-existing pathology, the young age of afflicted patients, and limitations of clinical tests, it is difficult to quantify the degree of visual deficit, determine how much of it is attributable to amblyopia, and assess responses to treatment. Success with treatment for SDA is also affected by compliance and the stress for the parents and the child associated with using occlusion therapy.</P>
<P>Existing evidence on the effects of interventions for SDA is derived largely from non-randomized studies of children with SDA caused by unilateral congenital cataract. Although current practice favors aggressive patching in early life, its effectiveness is supported only by a few case-series (<LINK REF="REF-Birch-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundvall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundvall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robb-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 1987</LINK>). Findings from these studies indicate wide variability in the patching regimen employed and the proportion of children who responded to treatment. Less intense occlusion regimens, while being easier to execute, have been advocated because they promote more binocular interaction and stereoacuity. Some of the less intensive occlusion regimens examined in previous studies include occlusion for one hour per day per month of age for the first six months of life (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>), and patching for six hours and 12 hours a day (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Occlusion regimens and treatment outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Current practice generally favors aggressive patching for SDA in early life based on the knowledge that the visual system is much more sensitive to change at this age. <LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1989</LINK> reported a negative correlation between the number of hours patched and the inter-ocular difference in acuity when treating SDA due to congenital cataract. In non-randomized studies of SDA, the definition of intensive or aggressive patching varied from a minimum of six hours per day to as much as 100% of waking hours. The definition of success also varied across the different studies. <LINK REF="REF-Birch-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 1988</LINK> reported that 53% achieved a visual acuity of 20/80 (6/24) or better. <LINK REF="REF-Lundvall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundvall 2002</LINK> found that 20% attained visual acuity of 0.1 (6/7.5) or better, <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1989</LINK> reported that 43% achieved better than 20/50 (6/9), and <LINK REF="REF-Robb-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 1987</LINK> found 46% achieved visual acuity of at least 20/70 (6/18). This brief summary of some previous studies highlights the different ways in which results can be categorized. These and other dissimilarities in study methodologies make it impossible to meaningfully compare results among these studies. Less intense occlusion regimens are easier to execute and have been advocated because they are expected to promote more binocular interaction and stereoacuity. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>) reported good visual and binocular results with occlusion of one hour per day per month of age for the first six months of life in children with congenital cataract. Nevertheless, most studies of less intense occlusion regimes have been conducted in children with strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia, or both, and results are probably not generalizable to children with SDA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compliance</HEADING>
<P>As with other types of amblyopia, treatment for SDA appears to rely on good compliance in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Studies on refractive and strabismic amblyopia have used objective methods to monitor how long occlusion is actually worn (<LINK REF="REF-Awan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2005</LINK>). These show that the prescribed amount of occlusion is not always achieved. Unfortunately, compliance in treating SDA is often difficult to achieve due to the severity of the visual acuity deficit. While it is not surprising that a treatment that visually compromises a child by means of an adhesive patch is not easy to deliver, justification of adoption or rejection of a treatment must carefully consider evidence of harm alongside evidence of benefit. In a culture where justifying an intervention is increasingly required, the current absence of clear evidence of effectiveness in this area is concerning.</P>

<P>It is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the data available from non-randomized studies since the study designs either do not compare treatment strategies or are subject to significant bias in the selection of participants for particular treatments. In addition, the variation between studies in treatment delivery and outcome measurement prevents any meaningful comparison or combination of results.</P>
<P>The general trend in practice, based on the proportion of papers we found reporting this treatment, favors an intensive occlusion therapy regimen to attain better visual outcomes. It is important to acknowledge that we did not systematically search for these papers and therefore they may represent a biased sample. It is currently difficult to objectively advise parents or formulate evidence-based guidelines for the management of SDA. Realistic expectations remain uncertain from the treatment for SDA and optimization of treatment regimens.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-23 11:09:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a clear and pressing need for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of interventions for SDA. Occlusion therapy is usually considered the mainstay of treatment for SDA. Some may argue that withholding it from children in a RCT may be unethical. But use of occlusion therapy is not supported by evidence from RCTs, and results in significant stress for both the children and their parents. Because there is a lack of evidence about whether the treatment is effective and safe, it should be ethical to randomize children to no occlusion therapy or an alternative treatment in a trial. It is important to acknowledge that there are practical challenges to setting up a randomized trial for SDA; due to the low numbers, a multicenter study would be required. In addition, many years of follow-up, for example to age seven, would be required to determine long term, post-treatment visual acuity outcomes. Nevertheless, such a study would provide extremely valuable evidence for the management of this condition.</P>
<P>Unsuccessful treatment ultimately results in the same outcome as no treatment, that is, reduced sight in one eye and loss of stereopsis. Exposure to treatment also carries the potential for harm. Thus, future studies on treatment for SDA should report treatment effect and accurately measure any potential physical, emotional or psychological harm.</P>
<P>The following are specific questions that need to be addressed in prospective randomized studies (with appropriate stratification to study any subgroup analyses).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>What is the safety and effectiveness of the interventions, including occlusion or patching for SDA?</LI>
<LI>What is the appropriate duration of treatment for SDA?</LI>
<LI>What is the level of vision that can realistically be achieved; what are the effects of age at onset and magnitude of visual defect?</LI>
<LI>What is the optimum occlusion regimen?</LI>
<LI>What are potential adverse effects from treatments for SDA?</LI>
<LI>What are the factors associated with satisfactory and unsatisfactory outcomes with various interventions for SDA?</LI>
