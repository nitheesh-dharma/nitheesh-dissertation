<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to assess effectiveness of urinary catheter washout solutions. This is an update of a review previously published in 2010.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>For a range of reasons, some people are unable to empty their bladders properly or leak urine (urinary incontinence). Urinary catheters, which are soft tubes inserted into the bladder to drain urine to a collection bag, are often used to help people with urinary incontinence. The same type of catheter is used for men and women.</P>
<P>In the UK, about 4% of people receiving home care, and around 9% of patients in nursing homes (but possibly up to 40% in some places), are living with long-term catheters.</P>
<P>Urinary catheter care can be difficult, and problems can occur, especially if used for a long time.</P>
<P>Catheter blockages can occur when kept in place in the bladder for a long time. Blockages may affect half of all people with long-term catheters causing pain and distress. Liquid solutions may be injected into the catheter to prevent or relieve blockages. This is known as a washout. These problems mean that assistance from healthcare professionals is needed for people with urinary catheter blockages.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current up to 23 May 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included seven studies that presented information on 217 people who completed the studies of 349 who started in the trials. Two studies were new for this update. The studies, published between 1979 and 2014, were conducted in the USA (3 studies), the UK (2 studies), and one each in Canada and Finland.</P>
<P>The studies included people with long-term catheters. People were allocated randomly to have catheter washouts or not, and the effects compared. We also included studies that compared different types of washout solutions.</P>
<P>Four studies reported on possible harmful effects of washout use, such as blood in the washout solution, changes in blood pressure and bladder spasms.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>The included studies were funded by Novobay Pharmaceuticals Inc (<A HREF="Linsenmeyer 2014">Linsenmeyer 2014</A>); Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Canadian Nurses Foundation (<A HREF="Moore 2009">Moore 2009</A>); National institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health (<A HREF="Muncie 1989">Muncie 1989</A>); Paralyzed Veterans of America Spinal Cord Research Foundation (<A HREF="Waites 2006">Waites 2006</A>). Three studies did not report funding sources.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>There was not enough good research evidence to determine if catheter washouts were useful.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included trials were generally small with methodological flaws. This included limited details on how participants were randomly allocated into groups and how both participants and researchers were blinded to these groups. Evidence quality was low to very low. New trials are needed to definitively answer this research question.</P>

<P>People requiring long-term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. Regimens involving different solutions can be used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage. This is an update of a review published in 2010.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-02-28 16:48:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine if certain washout regimens are better than others in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, complications, quality of life and critically appraise and summarise economic evidence for the management of long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:38:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings to 23 May 2016. We also examined all reference lists of identified trials and contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-02-15 15:57:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing catheter washout policies (e.g. washout versus no washout, different washout solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration) in adults (aged 16 years and above) in any setting (i.e. hospital, nursing/residential home, community) with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter for more than 28 days.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:39:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were assessed and analysed as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I>. If data in trials were not fully reported, clarification was sought from the study authors. For categorical outcomes, the numbers reporting an outcome were related to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR). For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations were used to derive mean differences (MD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:43:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies. Three were cross-over and four were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one parallel-group RCT with 40 participants and one cross-over RCT with 67 participants). Analyses of three cross-over trials yielded suboptimal results because they were based on between-group differences rather than individual participants' differences for sequential interventions. Two parallel-group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and the other provided data for only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants in this study.</P>
<P>The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures. None of the trials addressed: number of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes. Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. Two trials reported in more than one comparison group.</P>
<P>Four trials compared washout (either saline or acidic solution) with no washout. We are uncertain if washout solutions (saline or acidic), compared to no washout solutions, has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.</P>
<P>Four trials compared different types of washout solution; saline versus acidic solutions (2 trials); saline versus acidic solution versus antibiotic solution (1 trial); saline versus antimicrobial solution (1 trial). We are uncertain if type of washout solution has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.</P>
<P>One trial compared different compositions of acidic solution (stronger versus weaker solution). We are uncertain if different compositions of acidic solutions has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because only 14 participants (of 25 who were recruited) completed this 12 week, three arm trial.</P>
<P>Four studies reported on possible harmful effects of washout use, such as blood in the washout solution, changes in blood pressure and bladder spasms.</P>
<P>There were very few small trials that met the review inclusion criteria. The high risk of bias of the included studies resulted in the evidence being graded as low or very low quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:43:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from seven trials that compared different washout policies were limited, and generally, of poor methodological quality or were poorly reported. The evidence was not adequate to conclude if washouts were beneficial or harmful. Further rigorous, high quality trials that are adequately powered to detect benefits from washout being performed as opposed to no washout are needed. Trials comparing different washout solutions, washout volumes, and frequencies or timings are also needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:33:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indwelling catheterisation may be used for people with intractable incontinence or chronic bladder outlet obstruction. People may require long-term urinary catheterisation for a number of reasons: urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) or prostate tumour, reduced bladder contractility, or urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine) not amenable to toileting, intermittent catheterisation, or any other method of management. People with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, spina bifida, and spinal cord injury may be susceptible to these problems.</P>
<P>Numbers of people being managed using long-term catheters is difficult to estimate. Between April and May 2013, 1181 long-term care facilities in Europe participated in a point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infection and related risk factors. The median percentage of long-term care facility residents with a urinary catheter was 6.3%; the highest percentage of urinary catheterisation was reported in the Czech Republic (33.3%) (<LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2014</LINK>). The percentage of people receiving care at home with a urinary catheter was estimated to be 5.4% in another European study (range 0% to 23%) (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_rbye-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sørbye 2005</LINK>). Those using catheters long-term often experience complications such as blockage, leakage and infection. These complications can have significant implications for resource use and quality of life due to increased general practitioner and hospital outpatient appointments, emergency admissions and nursing resource demands (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bacterial infection</HEADING>
<P>Bacteriuria, which occurs when bacteria colonise the urinary tract, is the root cause of catheter-associated complications. Bacteriuria risk increases with days of catheterisation (<LINK REF="REF-Garibaldi-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garibaldi 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1984</LINK>); over time, all people with a catheter will develop bacteruria (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2012</LINK>). Increased levels of bacteriuria may expose people to increased risk of complications, including catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), secondary bacteraemia (blood infection) and infection at other sites, such as the joints. Up to 30% of long-term catheterised people will become symptomatic and require some intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1999</LINK>). Bacteriuria and CAUTI are significant problems in long-term care. People with urinary catheters are up to 6.5 times more likely to develop urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_rbye-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sørbye 2005</LINK>); the prevalence of CAUTI has been estimated to be 8.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to deal with the problems of bacterial colonisation, encrustations (biofilm) and CAUTI, catheter washouts or irrigations (sometimes called bladder washouts or irrigations) were introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 2003</LINK>). Over the last few decades, various antibiotic and antiseptic solutions have been used as washout solutions with the aim of preventing and treating catheter-associated problems. However, evidence about their effectiveness is conflicting. Concerns exist that use of washouts can damage the bladder mucosa and increase infection rates due to opening the closed catheter system. Current UK National Health Service guidelines specify that antibiotic solutions are not effective in treating CAUTI (<LINK REF="REF-HIS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HIS 2004</LINK>). Use of antiseptic washouts is also believed to be of little value for the prevention and treatment of CAUTI and is no longer advised in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Pellowe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellowe 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Catheter blockage</HEADING>
<P>The most common problem of long-term indwelling catheters is the formation of encrustations on the luminal and outer surfaces of the catheter with consequent blockage and by-passing of urine resulting in urinary leakage. Nearly half of all people with an indwelling catheter experience problems with catheter blockage due to encrustation (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kohler_x002d_Ockmore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohler-Ockmore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 1987</LINK>). Blockage of an indwelling catheter is traumatic, causing pain and distress. The most commonly isolated bacteria in blockages is <I>Proteus</I> <I>mirabilis </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Stickler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stickler 2010</LINK>), which may cause crystalline deposits (such as calcium phosphate and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite)) to build up through a rise in pH caused by the metabolism of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate (<LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilks 2015</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fungal infection</HEADING>
<P>Candiduria (the presence of <I>Candida</I> species in the urine) can also occur in people with long-term indwelling catheters, and its incidence is directly related to duration of catheterisation, hospitalisation and antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-Hamory-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamory 1978</LINK>). <I>Candida</I> spp are thought to be the second most common micro-organisms causing CAUTI or asymptomatic colonisation in people who are catheterised (<LINK REF="REF-Padawer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padawer 2015</LINK>). Candiduria is generally asymptomatic but rare complications can include fungal balls in the bladder or renal pelvis, kidney infection and disseminated candidiasis (infection with <I>Candida</I> spp). Management for people with asymptomatic catheter-associated candiduria is unclear. Removing the catheter results in the disappearance of candiduria in about a third of people. For people who are asymptomatic. but in whom candiduria persists or must remain catheterised, several management techniques have been used, primarily involving oral medication or bladder irrigation. The solutions used and the method of administration (continuous irrigation), in the treatment of fungal infections are very different and hence were not evaluated in this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-17 14:05:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current practice for the management of people with catheter encrustation and blockage varies but is largely dependent on the use of catheter maintenance solutions. Treatments commonly used for people living in the community include washing out the catheter with saline or acidic solutions or both. However, there is much debate about this practice. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-02-28 16:56:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In vitro evidence suggests that normal saline is ineffective in diminishing encrustations but there is some evidence that methenamine preparations and acidic washouts reduce catheter encrustation (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1991</LINK>). Other research work questions the efficacy of acidification of the urine for preventing catheter encrustation (<LINK REF="REF-Bibby-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bibby 1993</LINK>). Furthermore, none of the continence advisers questioned in a 1993 study thought that regular washouts were useful compared to 25% of district nurses who thought they were (<LINK REF="REF-Capewell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capewell 1993</LINK>). Despite the controversy surrounding the effectiveness of washouts for managing encrustation and blockage, they are widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Pomfret-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomfret 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-15 16:02:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no consensus regarding the indications for use of catheter washouts nor the method of administration, frequency, duration of administration or choice of solution. The wide variety of solutions available, combined with the multiplicity of possible procedures for their application, and potential risks posed, indicated need for an update of this systematic review. We aimed to summarise the evidence from randomised controlled trials on the use of catheter washouts for the management of adults with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. </P>

<P>Throughout the literature, the terminology used to refer to the 'washing-out' of catheters is somewhat confusing. The term 'washout' tends to be used in the US literature whereas in the UK, catheter washouts are often referred to as 'catheter maintenance solutions' or 'bladder washout' which can cause confusion with bladder irrigation/lavage used after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 1996</LINK>). In this review all trials referring to catheter or bladder washouts were considered with the exception of post-surgical bladder irrigations, therapeutic bladder instillations used, for example, in the treatment of people with cancer, and continuous irrigations with antifungal solutions.</P>
<P>Trials that involved irrigation of catheter drainage bags were not considered in this review. Other types of interventions to prevent or reduce encrustation or infection, such as changes in fluid intake or use of oral prophylactic antibiotics, were also excluded.</P>

<P>Most studies gave insufficient or no information relating to blinding.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>, 100 of 120 study catheters were examined for encrustation. The number of catheters found to be blocked (defined as the eye or lumen completely blocked resulting in no flow of urine) when removed after each three week solution period was reported: saline 18/44 catheters (41%), Suby G 14/29 catheters (48%), Solution R 7/27 catheters (26%). The study authors concluded that Solution R produced the best results and Suby G the worst, but no statistical tests were presented, and a time effect was noted such that blocked catheters would be removed early (before they could be examined) thus distorting the data. Regarding degree of visual encrustation, <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK> reported little difference among the three solutions up to day 10, after which it was felt Solution R did not reduce encrustation. Mean encrustation scores were presented but without standard deviations. Similarly, insufficient information was presented relating to the mean number of episodes of bypassing per week (saline 1.55, Suby G 1.4, Solution R 1.9), although the study authors reported that differences among groups for this outcome were not statistically significant (P value not reported).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK> compared auriclosene and saline washouts and reported encrustation rates only for participants in this study (N = 14). The area of encrustation (expressed as a percentage) within the catheter was assessed at three pre-selected locations. The maximum encrustation in any part of the catheter was used to determine catheter patency and was the primary endpoint of this trial. The auriclosene irrigation resulted in an average encrustation of 21.7% (95% CI 2.1% to 41.2%), versus 76.9% (95% CI 54.9% to 98.8%) average encrustation with saline (P value not reported). <LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK> reported percentages of catheters removed for clinical blockage and due to 100% encrustation.

<P>In the cross-over trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK> comparing three solutions, the percentage of participants with bacteria observed in washout fluid at the end of a washout period with one of the trial solutions were: saline 100%, Suby G 75%, Solution R 76%. Only percentages were presented and the denominators were unclear for these percentages. The presence of bacteria was also measured in 66 urine specimens collected from 25 participants at the time of catheter change. Of these, four samples showed no significant bacterial growth (3 after antibiotic treatment and 1 after saline washouts). It was therefore concluded that none of the solutions tested eliminated bacteria. The study authors stated that Suby G and Solution R appeared to reduce levels of bacteria but that differences were not statistically significant (statistical test results were not presented). It was further concluded that treatment with acidic solutions (Suby G and Solution R) did not prevent or reduce urease-producer bacteria. The published data on presence of bacteria were inadequately reported.</P>
<P>The percentages of participants harbouring <I>Enterococcus</I> spp (alone or in conjunction with other types of bacteria) after completing the <LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK> trial were: saline 13/21 participants (62%), acetic acid 7/9 participants (87%) and neomycin-polymyxin 19/22 participants (86%). No test of significant difference between groups was presented. In the antibiotic group, from study start to finish there was a significant increase in the number of participants with <I>Enterococci</I> spp bacteria (P = 0.02).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were insufficient data providing reliable evidence about the benefit or harms of washout policies to prevent catheter blockage or encrustation or for the relative merits of different washout solutions. Given that it was not possible to obtain sufficient information for further interpretation or analysis of existing published data from study authors, further high quality trials must be considered to provide rigorous evidence relating to the use of washouts. There are several important issues raised by this review which have implications for future research in this area.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:09:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified seven trials eligible for inclusion in this review relating to the use of washouts for people with long-term indwelling catheters. Most trials were small and under powered with inadequate reporting to permit judgement. The studies reviewed consisted of three randomised cross-over trials which had poor data reporting, three parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with very limited data, and one well-designed, but potentially under-powered, RCT. Of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures sought, data were available for six. Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. Due to the imprecision of the results of the included trials we are uncertain if washouts have an important effect on the primary outcomes of numbers of participants with symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) and length of time each catheter was in situ. Main results are summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:11:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the included trials addressed: number of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health and very limited health economic data were available. Any new policy regarding the management of long-term urinary catheters with or without the use of washout solutions must be shown to be favourable for these important outcomes. As for the eight pre-identified washout comparisons, the included trials provided data relating to only three (any catheter washout solution versus no catheter washout; one type of catheter washout solution versus another type; and a stronger washout solution versus a weaker washout solution). No trials looked at different volumes of the same washout solution. Studies tended to use the volume of solution provided in the manufacturer's pre-prepared containers. Volumes ranged from 10 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1979</LINK>) to 100 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>). None of the trials compared different washout frequencies. However, washout frequency varied: twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK>), daily (<LINK REF="STD-McNicoll-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNicoll 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK>), twice weekly (<LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK>), weekly (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>), and every two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1979</LINK>). The length of time the washout was retained in the bladder ranged from 15 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>) to 20 to 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>)), as did the duration of the intervention from 3 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>) to 26 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important that a washout period is used in cross-over trials where there is potential for a carry-over effect from one treatment period to the next. Both included cross-over trials used this approach; <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK> used a two-week phase between trial periods with no intervention, and <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK> used a one-week phase during which participants had a saline washout. Both <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK> also used run-in periods of two weeks of no washout and one week of saline washout respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK> stated that a washout period was used between different solutions but the timing was not provided. No reason was given for length of the run-in or washout periods.</P>
<P>Included trials' participants varied in several ways. In some trials participants had histories of blocked catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNicoll-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNicoll 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>); other trials did not limit participation in this way, or did not mention any history of catheter blocking. There may be merit in looking specifically at those people with a history of catheter blocking; anecdotally, it is thought that some people are more susceptible than others.</P>
<P>The participant characteristics and settings varied in the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK> studied older women (mean ages 82 years and 71 years, respectively) who were inpatients in long-term or geriatric care settings compared to community-dwelling men and women with neurogenic bladder studied by <LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK> (mean age 45.8 years) and <LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK> (mean age 46.6 years). <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1979</LINK> studied a mix of long-term or hospital care and home care participants. No information on age and gender was available for <LINK REF="STD-McNicoll-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNicoll 2003</LINK>. The effects of a washout, if any, may differ in such diverse populations and careful thought is needed regarding whether such trials results could be usefully compared in future reviews.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:11:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the trials and their reporting was generally inadequate. All the trials had small sample sizes; overall 349 participants were randomised and 217 completed the studies. The randomisation sequence of participants was clearly described in only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>) and unclear in five. Concealment of group allocation was poor or inadequately described in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>). Three trials were deemed at high risk of bias for lack of blinding (<LINK REF="STD-McNicoll-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNicoll 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK>). However, depending on the washout regimen, blinding of participants or the health professional to the intervention may have been impossible. In regard to detection bias, the seven studies did not describe accurately the methods of detecting outcomes; therefore, all were assessed as unclear risk of bias. We assessed four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muncie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muncie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK>) to be at low risk of attrition bias. Three lacked detail and were judged to be an unclear bias (<LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linsenmeyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Linsenmeyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNicoll-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNicoll 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included trials were somewhat heterogeneous in terms of the outcomes measured. Most trials assessed bacteriuria, and blockage/encrustation, although methods for doing so and definitions used varied greatly. Definitions of symptomatic UTI in particular were poorly described and differed among trials. Standardised methods for assessing these key outcomes in catheter research are needed. There was a consistent lack of adequate reporting of statistical information e.g. denominators for percentages, summary statistics such as standard deviations and details of statistical tests. This made interpreting the study results difficult, and extracting the data impossible in many cases. The methods used by study authors to analyse data from the cross-over trials were referenced and seemed appropriate, taking into account the paired nature of the data. However, the reporting of these analyses in the reports was poor and assessment of the findings and data extraction were not possible.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched all relevant databases without language restriction to obtain as many reports of trials as possible. We also included trial registries in this search and contacted authors for further information about trials that were reported as completed, where applicable. However, despite these attempts to minimise publication bias it is possible that not all eligible trials were included in the databases that we searched. To reduce the risk of bias during the review process, we used the methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), this included two authors screening the literature search results for potentially eligible studies and double data extraction.</P>

<P>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <I>Guideline for prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection</I>s <I>(CAUTI)</I> was updated in 2009 due to an increasing focus on the non-acute setting and patients in need of long-term urinary catheterisation. The <I>Guideline</I> considered the best practices for preventing CAUTI associated with obstructed urinary catheters and concluded that no recommendation could be given for the use of irrigation solutions because the evidence was not available to answer the question. Many of the studies referred to by <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK> considered patients who used intermittent catheterisation and therefore were not included in this review because they did not match our inclusion criteria. The findings of <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK> agree with findings from this review and provide further support for the need for high quality trials in this area.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:12:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to guide clinical practice regarding all aspects of using washouts for long-term indwelling catheters. It is unknown if washouts convey any benefits or harms for patients using indwelling catheters in the long-term. We found very little evidence on economic outcomes associated with managing long-term indwelling catheter use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:13:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for a large RCT with rigorous methods which will determine the optimal policies to prevent or relieve catheter blockage. This trial would initially include a 'no washout' arm as there is first a need for evidence regarding whether catheter washouts compared to no washout are beneficial. Objective measures of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and blockage including length of time catheter in situ, catheter removal rates, and number of catheters used would be key outcome measures. Washout acceptability (patient discomfort, satisfaction, pain), and psychological health (quality of life) using validated tools must also be considered. Health economic analysis associated with different washout regimens must also be reported. Other variables that may influence outcome, and which should be allowed for in the design of a future trial, include baseline characteristics of urine (e.g. acidity), condition of patient dictating the need for indwelling catheterisation, and the patient's fluid intake. We would also suggest that long-term follow up is needed; this would provide very valuable evidence. Given the difficulty experienced in previous trials in recruiting and retaining participants, it may be sensible to standardise the different types of catheters in future trials to maximise the chances of detecting any differences between groups.</P>
<P>With one exception (<LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK>), the washout procedure was undertaken by a healthcare professional in the included studies. After the first washout <LINK REF="STD-Waites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Waites 2006</LINK> gave pre-prepared solutions to the participant to use at home. This is an interesting, and potentially cost-saving, approach to catheter care which may be appropriate for certain patient groups, and could perhaps be the subject of a future trial.</P>

<P>For the 2017 update of the review there was no additional searching of databases other than the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register as this now includes relevant searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, <A HREF="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">WHO ICTRP</A>, and <A HREF="http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/">UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio</A>. Cochrane now organises centralised searches of Embase (including conference abstracts) that are included in CENTRAL so no additional Embase searches were performed.

<P>For the first published version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2010</LINK>) we searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Trials Register (searched 30 April 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2009), MEDLINE In-Process (30 April 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2009) and CINAHL (December 1981 to April 2009). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials and contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
<P>The Incontinence Group Specialised Register was searched using the Group's own keyword system. The search terms used were:</P>
<P>({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({intvent.mech.cath.washout*} OR {intvent.mech.cath.irrigation*} OR {intvent.prevent.cath*})<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).</P>
<P>For this first version of the review specific extra searches were performed by the review authors (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2010</LINK>). These are detailed below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2009),</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE In-Process (searched on 30 April 2009),</LI>
<LI>EMBASE (January 1980 to Week 17 2009) was searched on 27 April 2009,</LI>
<LI>CINAHL on OVID (1982 to July Week 1 2007) was searched on 18 July 2007,</LI>
<LI>CINAHL on EBSCO (December 1981 to Week 4 April 2009) was searched on 28 April 2009.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These databases were searched by the review authors using appropriate free text and MeSH terms/EMTREE terms/controlled vocabulary. This was done by adapting terms drawn from the existing search strategies of the Cochrane Incontinence group to meet the objectives of this review. Full details of the search terms used are given below:</P>

<P>The UK National Research Register, Controlled Clinical Trials and ZETOC database of conference abstracts were searched on 17 October 2006 using various combinations of the following search terms: catheter, bladder, washout, maintenance, solution, irrigation, instillation, care, infection, bacteriuria, encrustation, blockage, occlusion, crystallisation, anti-infective agents, anti-bacterial agents.</P>
<P>
<B>Searching other resources</B>
</P>
<P>We placed calls for information about other possibly relevant trials on the Association for Continence Advice (ACA) website (March 2007), the ACA quarterly Journal (Volume 26 Issue 2 2007), and the weekly Update of Royal College of Nursing Research &amp; Development Co-ordinating Centre electronic bulletin (W/C 26 March 2007). Presentations were given at the 2007 RCN International Nursing Research Conference (April 2007), the 22nd Annual Scottish Task Force Symposium on Incontinence (May 2007) and the Scottish NMAHP Research into Practice Conference (October 2007) to inform others of this review and invite information on other possibly relevant studies.</P>
