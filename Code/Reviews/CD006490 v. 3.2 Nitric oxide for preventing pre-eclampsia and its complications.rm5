<P>Not enough evidence to say if nitric oxide donors or their precursors are helpful in preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 10% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected by huge swelling and sometimes they go on to have fits. Nitric oxide drugs, like glycerol trinitrate, or their precursors, like L-arginine, may play a role in helping to prevent pre-eclampsia through their action in relaxing blood vessel walls. The review of trials found too few women had been studied, so it was not possible to say if nitric oxide drugs help prevent pre-eclampsia. However, these drugs did cause headaches, often sufficiently severe for women to stop taking the drugs. Future studies need to address these adverse effects and seek women's views.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pre-eclampsia, a multisystem disorder of pregnancy characterised by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates many functions of the endothelium, including vasodilatation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Pre-eclampsia may be associated with nitric oxide deficiency, but the evidence to support this suggestion is contradictory. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesised that agents which increase nitric oxide may prevent pre-eclampsia. <BR/> </P>

<P>Six trials (310 women) were included. Four were of good quality and two were of uncertain quality.

<P>Glyceryl trinitrate was associated with an increased risk of headache (two trials, 56 women; RR 6.85, 95% CI 1.42 to 33.04), and of stopping treatment (two trials, 56 women; RR 4.02, 95% CI 1.15 to 14.09) compared to placebo.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-18 21:22:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women will have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy comprise a spectrum of conditions that is usually classified into four categories: (i) gestational hypertension, a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (ii) pre-eclampsia, usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (iii) chronic hypertension, a rise in blood pressure prior to pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, and (iv) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP2000</LINK>). For women with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Outcome deteriorates once pre-eclampsia develops or if the blood pressure is very high. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder, involving the liver, kidneys, brain, and placenta. It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>), and is associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Complications for the mother may include eclampsia (seizures), stroke, liver or kidney failure, and abnormal blood clotting, and problems for the baby may include poor growth and preterm birth.</P>
<P>The cause of pre-eclampsia is uncertain, but current belief is that reduced blood supply to the placenta leads to abnormal function of endothelial cells, possibly as a result of oxidative stress. Endothelial dysfunction results in generalised vasoconstriction, platelet activation and thrombosis, and decreased plasma volume, with subsequently reduced blood supply to multiple organs. Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1987, nitric oxide was first identified as an endothelium derived factor associated with vascular relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Ignarro-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ignarro 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1987</LINK>). Although it is now known to have a wide range of biological functions, interest in its possible role in pre-eclampsia has been generated largely because nitric oxide mediates many functions of the endothelium, including vasodilatation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Nitric oxide is believed to contribute, at least in part, to the physiological vascular adaptations of normal pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Sladek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sladek 1997</LINK>). Therefore, reduced availability of nitric oxide may have a role in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Although accumulating evidence over the last decade has yielded contradictory results, this hypothesis has raised the possibility that therapeutic agents that increase nitric oxide, or nitric oxide donors and precursors, may prevent or treat pre-eclampsia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Technical background</HEADING>
<P>Nitric oxide is produced in the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, from the amino acid L-arginine, by the action of a group of enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS). It then diffuses into adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells and increases the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Nitric oxide promotes vasodilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Moncada-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncada 1991</LINK>) and reduces the effect of vasoconstrictors (<LINK REF="REF-Myatt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myatt 1992</LINK>). It also inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion to vascular endothelial surfaces, limits thrombus formation (<LINK REF="REF-Radomski-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radomski 1987</LINK>), modifies the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits interactions between immune and endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-De-Caterina-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Caterina 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kubes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubes 1991</LINK>). The balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant forces in endothelial cells may be influenced by nitric oxide, and reduced availability may contribute to development of oxidative stress.</P>
<P>During normal pregnancy, nitric oxide appears to play a role in physiological vasodilatation, decreased responsiveness to vasopressors, and increased uteroplacental blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Sladek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sladek 1997</LINK>). However, data from human studies are conflicting, and it is unclear whether these changes result from an overall increase in nitric oxide production, only a local increase in certain tissues, or increased responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to normal levels of nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Sladek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sladek 1997</LINK>). Similarly, in pre-eclampsia, although a deficiency of nitric oxide may explain some of its characteristic features, evidence for the role of nitric oxide is contradictory. If the availability of nitric oxide is indeed reduced, it is also unclear whether this is due to increased degradation of nitric oxide or reduced production. Increased degradation of nitric oxide may result from the oxidative stress which occurs in pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Hubel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2000</LINK>). Nitric oxide production may be reduced if there is a deficiency of L-arginine or an increase in NOS enzyme inhibitors. Some investigators have found evidence of decreased nitric oxide production in the serum and urine of women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Davidge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidge 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seligman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seligman 1994</LINK>), but others have failed to demonstrate such reductions (<LINK REF="REF-Conrad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conrad 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1996</LINK>). Reduced serum levels of L-arginine have been demonstrated but were mirrored by increased nitric oxide production, so are likely to represent increased consumption of L-arginine (<LINK REF="REF-Benedetto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedetto 2000</LINK>). There is evidence that NOS activity within platelets is reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Delacretaz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delacretaz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neri-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri 2000a</LINK>), and that the normal inhibitor of NOS enzyme, asymmetric dimethylarginine, is increased in women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Fickling-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fickling 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In animal studies, chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis produces a clinical picture similar to pre-eclampsia, with the development of hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, reduced plasma volume and intrauterine growth restriction in pregnant rats (<LINK REF="REF-Molnar-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molnar 1994</LINK>). In humans, in vitro inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis in blood vessels causes vasoconstriction, but less so in blood vessels from women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Cockell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockell 1997</LINK>), suggesting that there may already be a basal deficiency of nitric oxide in pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Decreased L-arginine concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Noris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noris 2004</LINK>) and reduced NOS activity (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>) have been found in the placenta of women with pre-eclampsia, and in vitro stimulation of NOS in umbilical vessels from women with pre-eclampsia results in less production of nitric oxide compared to normal pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Pinto-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinto 1991</LINK>). However, others have found increased placental expression of the NOS enzyme (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Iorio-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Iorio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaamash-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaamash 2001</LINK>) and increased levels of nitric oxide metabolites in umbilical vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Lyall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1999</LINK>) and amniotic fluid of women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Iorio-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Iorio 1998</LINK>). A possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that the increase in nitric oxide production in specific tissues may be a compensatory response to pre-eclampsia, rather than contributing to its aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Shaamash-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaamash 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uterine artery resistance may be increased in pre-eclampsia, compromising blood flow to the placenta. Some studies have demonstrated that administration of nitric oxide donors is associated with a reduction in uterine artery resistance in women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thaler 1999</LINK>). Although this observation has not been confirmed in all reports (<LINK REF="REF-Grunewald-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunewald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makino-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 1997</LINK>), it has led some to suggest that nitric oxide may have a role in prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. Others have highlighted concerns that such dilatation of the uterine vessels may not be appropriate in all cases of pre-eclampsia, and may theoretically result in a relative underfill of the uterine circulation, further compromising blood supply to the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Poston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poston 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Nitric oxide agents</HEADING>
<P>Drugs that can be converted by the body into nitric oxide (known as nitric oxide donors) are widely available, and have been used for years as therapeutic agents in cardiovascular diseases such as angina and hypertension. Commonly used nitric oxide donors include glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, S-nitroglutathione, and sodium nitroprusside. They may be taken in a range of ways such as oral or sublingual tablets, aerosol spray under the tongue, skin patches, or by intravenous injection. Tolerance can develop quickly, with reduced therapeutic effect, but is minimised by carefully timed, intermittent administration. Common side-effects include headache, flushing, postural hypotension, and local irritation with patches. There are no known risks associated with the use of nitric oxide donors in pregnancy. A potential risk, associated with all vasodilators, is hypotension with subsequent reduction in the blood supply to the fetus and placenta.</P>
<P>L-arginine is an amino acid essential for the body's production of nitric oxide (known as a nitric oxide precursor). It is also commercially available, and may be given orally as tablets, or solution, or by intravenous injections. Known side-effects include diarrhoea. Although L-arginine has not been associated with any adverse effects on the fetus in the few studies which have evaluated it, there are limited data on safety during pregnancy.</P>
<P>Another group of compounds known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5-selective inhibitors) also enhance the effects of nitric oxide. These drugs act by blocking enzymes which break down the molecule that mediates the effects of nitric oxide in the body, or cGMP. High concentrations of cGMP in smooth muscle cells lead to vascular relaxation. These drugs include sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, and have been used to treat male sexual impotence and pulmonary hypertension. Although no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies, there are currently few data on safety in human pregnancy.</P>
<P>The use of nitric oxide for prevention of pre-eclampsia appears attractive. However, before nitric oxide agents can be recommended for use in clinical practice, reliable evidence is required on whether they are both effective and safe.</P>

<P>Four trials (170 women) compared nitric oxide donors (glycerol trinitrate) or precursors (L-Arginine) with control (either placebo or no nitric oxide donor or precursor). Overall, there are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the effects on pre-eclampsia (four trials, 170 women; relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.41), perinatal death (three trials 114 women; RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.34), preterm birth (three trials 154 women; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.07) or having a small-for-gestational-age baby (two trials 108 women; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.70).</P>
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate was associated with an increased relative risk of headache compared to placebo (two trials, 56 women; RR 6.85, 95% CI 1.42 to 33.04). Both glyceryl trinitrate and placebo were given as skin patches, and there was no clear difference between the groups in the risk of skin rashes (two trials 56 women; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.07). Women allocated glyceryl trinitrate were more likely to stop treatment than those allocated placebo (two trials, 56 women; RR 4.02, 95% CI 1.15 to 14.09). This was due to headaches for women allocated glyceryl trinitrate in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>). In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lees-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lees 1998</LINK>) equal numbers of women in the two groups stopped treatment due to skin rashes.</P>
<P>The increase in the relative risk of headaches, and stopping treatment, was due to an extreme result in one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>) (7/7 versus 0/9 for both outcomes).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of nitric oxide for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. Four small trials have evaluated the effects of using either a nitric oxide donor or a precursor compared with placebo or no intervention in women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Three of these trials were good quality and one was poorly described. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effectiveness of these agents. However, the use of glyceryl trinitrate does appear to be associated with an increased risk of headache, and this was sufficiently severe to lead to stopping of treatment in some cases. The use of nitric oxide precursor L-arginine in one small trial was associated with a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia that was borderline for statistical significance. Although promising, this result should be interpreted with caution as the numbers are so small, and the confidence intervals suggest that the true effect may be anything from a 91% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia to a 2% increase associated with L-arginine.</P>
<P>Two small trials have compared glyceryl trinitrate with other interventions. In one study the comparison was with nifedipine, in the other it was with antiplatelets. The nifedipine trial was of good quality whereas the antiplatelet trial was of uncertain quality. In both these studies, the confidence intervals for all outcomes reported were wide and crossed the line of no effect. There is therefore insufficient evidence for any reliable conclusions. </P>
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate during pregnancy may be associated with headaches severe enough to stop treatment. Although this trend towards increased risk of headache is consistent across the comparisons, it only achieves statistical significance in the comparison with placebo where it is heavily dependant on the results from one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>). In this study all seven women allocated glyceryl trinitrate had headaches, and none of those were allocated placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>). This small study is also unusual in that the risk of headache in the treatment group is considerably higher than in the other studies. Hence, the true impact on the incidence and severity of headaches remains unclear. In addition, although skin patches are theoretically attractive for administration of glyceryl trinitrate during pregnancy, the risk of skin rashes for both the active and placebo patches appears to be around 10%. Strategies to minimise potential side-effects, such as using a lower dose or different route of administration, or alternative agents that have similar potential benefits but with fewer side-effects, should be explored. The nitric oxide precursor L-arginine appears to be a promising alternative, although its use was associated with diarrhoea in some women. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Until there is clear evidence that nitric oxide donors and precursors are both effective and safe for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications, they should not be used in clinical practice. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-01-18 21:00:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further large randomised trials are needed to assess whether nitric oxide reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications. In view of the potential association between glyceryl trinitrate and headaches, the side-effect profile during pregnancy should be further evaluated. This might include using a lower dose or different modes of administration. Alternative agents, such as L-arginine, also merit further assessment of their role in preventing pre-eclampsia.</P>
