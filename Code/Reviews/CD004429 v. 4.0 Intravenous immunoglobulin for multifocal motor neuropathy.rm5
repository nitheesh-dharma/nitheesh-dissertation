<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment improves strength significantly more often than placebo</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare condition causing progressive weakness of the limbs. The arms and especially the hands, are more commonly involved than the legs. The usual treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy is infusion of immunoglobulin (antibodies purified from the blood) into a vein. Evidence from four randomised controlled trials showed that people treated with intravenous immunoglobulin had significant improvements in strength. Improvement in disability was also seen but was not significant. Side effects were common but were mild and transient.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare, probably immune mediated disorder characterised by slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal weakness of one or more limbs with no objective loss of sensation. It may cause prolonged periods of disability. The treatment options for multifocal motor neuropathy are sparse. Patients with multifocal motor neuropathy do not usually respond to steroids or plasma exchange, and may even worsen with these treatments. Many uncontrolled studies have suggested a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review systematically the evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin in multifocal motor neuropathy. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We used the search strategy of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Review Group to search the Disease Group register (searched March 2007), MEDLINE (January 1990 to March 2007), EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2007) and ISI (January 1990 to March 2007) databases for randomised controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled studies examining the effects of any dose of intravenous immunoglobulin versus placebo in patients with definite or probable multifocal motor neuropathy.<BR/>Outcome measures had to include one of the following: disability, strength, or conduction block. Studies which reported the frequency of adverse effects were used to assess safety.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials, scored their quality and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks, and for continuous data, effect sizes and weighted pooled effect sizes. Statistical uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials including a total of 34 patients were suitable for this systematic review. Strength improved in 78% of patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and only 4% of placebo-treated patients. Disability improved in 39% of patients after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and in 11% after placebo (statistically not significantly different). Mild, transient side effects were reported in 71% of intravenous immunoglobulin treated patients. Serious side effects were not encountered.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that intravenous immunoglobulin has a beneficial effect on strength. There was a non-significant trend towards improvement in disability. More research is needed to discover whether intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability and is cost-effective.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 22:36:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is characterised by slowly progressive, asymmetric, predominantly distal weakness of one or more limbs with no objective loss of sensation (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parry-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2002</LINK>) This weakness may be accompanied by muscular atrophy in later stages of the disease, and cramps and fasciculations are reported to occur in approximately 50% of people with MMN (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). The arms are usually more affected than the legs (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000a</LINK>). Tendon reflexes are often decreased or absent in the affected limb. Cranial nerve involvement and respiratory failure due to phrenic nerve palsy have occasionally been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Beydoun-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beydoun 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cavaletti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavaletti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaji-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaji 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pringle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pringle 1997</LINK>). The hallmark of the disease is the presence of multifocal conduction block on electrophysiological testing outside the usual sites of nerve compression (<LINK REF="REF-Cornblath-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornblath 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaji-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaji 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Asseldonk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Asseldonk 2003</LINK>). Conduction block is a reduction in the amplitude or area (or both) of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) obtained by proximal versus distal stimulation of motor nerves in the absence of or with only focal abnormal temporal dispersion (<LINK REF="REF-Cornblath-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornblath 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaji-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaji 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). The extent of reduction of the CMAP amplitude and/or area necessary for conduction block is still a matter of debate. Definite conduction block is usually defined as an area reduction of 50% or more between proximal versus distal stimulation in a long nerve segment or an amplitude reduction of 30% or more over 2.5 cm (<LINK REF="REF-Franssen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franssen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rhee-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhee 1990</LINK>). Probable conduction block is usually defined as an amplitude reduction of 30% or more between proximal versus distal stimulation in an arm nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Almost 80% of people with MMN are between 20 and 50 years of age at onset of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). Men are more frequently affected than women with a ratio of 2.6:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). The prevalence is estimated to be 1 to 2 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). The diagnosis of MMN is based on clinical, laboratory and electrophysiological characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000a</LINK>). A set of diagnostic criteria has been proposed that combines clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological features of people with MMN, which may help to predict whether individuals will respond to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000a</LINK>). Recently, the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine has developed five criteria through a formal consensus process for diagnosing MMN with a high level of confidence (<LINK REF="REF-Olney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olney 2003</LINK>). These criteria for definite MMN are: weakness without objective sensory loss in the distribution of two or more nerves; definite conduction block in two or more nerves outside of common entrapment sites; normal sensory nerve conduction velocity across the same segments with demonstrated motor conduction block; normal results for sensory nerve conduction studies on all tested nerves, with a minimum of three nerves tested; and absence of upper motor neuron signs. The criteria for probable MMN are somewhat less strict for conduction block.</P>
<P>Multifocal motor neuropathy seems to be an immune mediated disorder. Firstly, 30% to 80% of people with MMN have serum IgM GM1 antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willison 2002</LINK>). Secondly, increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MR images of the brachial plexus have been observed in people with MMN suggesting an inflammatory process (<LINK REF="REF-van-Es-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Es 1997</LINK>). Finally, a beneficial effect of cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krarup-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krarup 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meucci-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meucci 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pestronk-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pestronk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Es-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Es 1997</LINK>) and interferon-beta 1a (<LINK REF="REF-Martina-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martina 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000b</LINK>) in MMN has been suggested in several uncontrolled studies and reviewed in a Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Umapathi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umapathi 2003</LINK>). The treatment options for people with MMN are sparse. In contrast to the response in people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), those with MMN usually do not respond to steroids or plasma exchange, and may worsen when they receive these treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2001</LINK>). Cyclophosphamide has serious long-term side effects and interferon-beta 1a has only been tested in very limited numbers of people with MMN.</P>
<P>The efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been suggested in many open and uncontrolled studies including at least 100 people with MMN. At the time of initiating this review four randomised controlled double-blind trials of IVIg for treating MMN were known to have been done (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). The ways by which IVIg exerts its supposed beneficial effect in MMN are not clear, but various mechanisms have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1999</LINK>). Studies in other diseases treated with IVIg have demonstrated that IVIg may inhibit auto-antibody production, neutralize pathogenic antibodies, and decrease antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by blocking Fc-receptors on macrophages (<LINK REF="REF-Kazatchkine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazatchkine 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, peripheral blood from patients treated with IVIg shows increased CD8-positive suppressor T-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Delfraissy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delfraissy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leung-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macey 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>We here provide a systematic review of the randomised trials with IVIg which have been undertaken in MMN.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We searched for all randomised or quasi-randomised (alternate or other systematic allocation) studies examining the effects of IVIg treatment in people with MMN. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Eligible studies had to include unselected participants with definite or probable MMN according to the published criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Olney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olney 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000a</LINK>). This was defined as a slowly or stepwise progressive asymmetric lower motor neuron syndrome with no bulbar or upper motor signs and evidence of definite or probable conduction block in motor nerves. Mild sensory symptoms were permitted as long as there were no sensory signs on examination and sensory nerve conduction studies were normal. Patients with upper motor neuron features or bulbar signs had to be excluded. Other related conditions such as other neuropathies (diabetic, lead, porphyric, or vasculitic neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, Lyme neuroborreliosis, postradiation neuropathy, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or paraproteinaemic neuropathies) and myopathies (facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, inclusion body myositis), had to be excluded if indicated. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We considered any dose of immunoglobulin administered intravenously compared with placebo or any other treatment. All brands of IVIg were included provided that the preparation has been produced according to the guidelines of the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1982</LINK>). </P>

<P>Since these studies used different disability scales, the primary outcome measure was defined as the proportion of participants with a significant improvement in disability between two and four weeks after the last treatment and compared to baseline as determined and defined by the authors of the studies (Comparison 01.01). In each study the most strict available criteria to define 'significant' improvement were used. As IVIg is thought to induce and maintain improvement in the majority of people with MMN, but does not eradicate the disease, patients have to be treated with periodic infusions for long periods of time. Outcome assessment between two and four weeks after the last IVIg treatment will probably reflect the treatment responses of these patients best.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register, MEDLINE (from January 1990 to March 2007), EMBASE (from January 1990 to March 2007), and ISI (from January 1990 to March 2007) using the keywords and textwords: 'motor neuron disease', 'demyelinating neuropathy', 'motor neuropathy', 'multifocal motor neuropathy', 'multifocal demyelinating motor neuropathy', 'ganglioside GM1', 'nerve block', 'immunoglobulin', 'immunoglobulin G', 'intravenous drug administration', 'clinical trials'. The search was been restricted to articles published from 1990 onwards because to our knowledge IVIg was first used in MMN in 1990. A search of the references listed in the published studies, reviews, textbooks, and relevant conference proceedings was performed. Investigators identified as active in the field were contacted to identify unpublished or overlooked studies. Readers are invited to suggest studies, particularly in other languages, which should be considered for inclusion when the review is updated.</P>

<P>Methodological quality took into account allocation concealment, a secure method of randomisation, patient blinding, observer blinding, explicit inclusion criteria, extent to which the study takes into account any imbalance in prognostically important variables present at the time of randomisation, and explicit outcome criteria. Quality indices were graded A: adequate, B: unclear, if there was inadequate information to judge the index, and C: inadequate, if the index was inadequately addressed, and D: not done. Internal validity was assessed using a scoring system of 11 questions covering three items: (1) risk of pre-allocation disclosure of assignment, (2) intention to treat analysis, and (3) blinding of outcome measures. Total scores for each paper could range from 11 to 33. The total score for each paper was expressed as a proportion of the total possible score of 33. Thus internal validity scores could range from 0.33 (11/33) to 1.00 (33/33).</P>

<P>For dichotomous data, such as the proportion of patients with a significant improvement in disability, we calculated the relative risk for each study. To assess overall efficacy from all the studies, we calculated pooled relative risk estimates. When chi-square analysis showed our data to be heterogeneous, we used the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 1995</LINK>). If no heterogeneity could be demonstrated, we used a fixed effect model (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio method) (<LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1986</LINK>). With regard to continuous data (changes in muscle strength), effect sizes have been calculated for each study as muscle strength assessment was not sufficiently comparable between studies to allow for analysis with weighted mean differences. Effect size is defined as the mean change in score of the placebo group minus mean change in score of the treatment group, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the change in scores of the two groups. Means, standards deviations and standard errors were derived by calculation or extraction from the available data. Individual weighted effect sizes were pooled with the generic inverse variance (GIV) method which is available in the Review Manager (RevMan) software. In this method 1/variance is used as weights. Absolute risk differences were obtained using RevMan analyses. The numbers needed to treat were calculated by taking the inverse of the absolute risk difference. Statistical uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<P>The search strategy turned out to be rather sensitive. Two hundred and eighty-five titles were retrieved.

We excluded twelve studies (<LINK REF="STD-Auer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Auer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charles-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jafari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jafari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kermode-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kermode 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Komiyama-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Komiyama 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubori-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kubori 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pestronk-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pestronk 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg-V 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuki-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yuki 1993</LINK>) for reasons explained in the Table of Characteristics of Excluded Studies.</P>
<P>A total of four RCTs were considered eligible including a total of 34 patients with MMN (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). One study was designed as a proof-of-principle study (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). Although patients in this study were selected on the basis of IVIg response in an open trial before entering a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised crossover trial it was decided to include this study because all patients were unselected when entering the open phase of the trial and all these patients responded to IVIg. Therefore, all patients entered the second phase. As this is debatable, results have been shown with and without this study.</P>
<P>All four RCTs compared IVIg treatment with placebo and had a crossover design. A total of 2 g/kg bodyweight of IVIg (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>) or 2.5 g/kg bodyweight of IVIg (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>) was administered over five days.</P>
<P>Crossover took place eight weeks after the first treatment in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>). In another study, patients were crossed over into the second arm at day 28 if they remained unchanged or deteriorated (<LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>). Patients who improved at day 28 did not enter the second arm until they were back at baseline levels. Léger et al. treated patients each month for three months (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>). After three treatment periods all patients who were responders remained on the same treatment for three months, and the non-responders were crossed over for the following three months. Van den Berg et al treated patients four times with IVIg or placebo in random order (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). The interval between each treatment was determined by the time it took for the patient to get back to baseline levels, with a minimum of one month. The outcome measures used in this review were assessed at one month after the last IVIg infusion in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>), and at variable timepoints ranging between two and six weeks in one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>).<BR/>Each study used different outcome measures.

Intravenous immunoglobulin or placebo were each given 18 times. A significant improvement was reported in seven out of 18 (39%) IVIg treatments and in two out of 18 (11%) placebo treatments. A higher, but not significant, proportion of patients improved after IVIg therapy as compared with placebo with a pooled relative risk of 3.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 10.12).

<P>Three RCTs including 27 patients provided data for this outcome and were analysed for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). Azulay et al. obtained a muscle score by summing the strength assessed in two selected muscles which had to be impaired and were selected at the beginning of the study. An improvement was defined as an increased muscle score of more than 50% compared to baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>). In this study, five patients improved in muscle strength after IVIg and none after placebo. Van den Berg et al. assessed 11 different muscles using a handheld dynamometer. An improvement was defined as an increase of 50% or more in at least two muscles, without a decrease of at least 25% in more than one other muscle (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>). In this study, five out of six patients improved after IVIg and one after placebo. Federico et al. asked their patients to rate subjectively their strength at the end of a treatment period compared to the beginning (<LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>). In this study 11 out of 16 patients rated their strength as improved whereas none of the patients did so after placebo.<BR/>Overall, a significant improvement of muscle strength was reported in 21 out of 27 (78%) IVIg treatments and in one out of 27 (4%) placebo treatments. A significantly higher proportion of patients improved after IVIg therapy as compared with placebo with a pooled relative risk of 11.00 (95% CI 2.86 to 42.25). The study results were homogeneous (chi-square 0.99, P value = 0.61).

On average, muscle strength on IVIg improved by 280 N and decreased by 31 N on placebo. Federico et al. assessed grip strength with a handheld dynamometer (<LINK REF="STD-Federico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2000</LINK>). Grip strength improved by 6.4 kg with IVIg treatment and worsened by 1.0 kg with placebo. The <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>trial measured the MRC sum score of 28 muscles (maximum score 140). The mean improvement after IVIg treatment was 3 points, whereas patients treated with placebo improved 1 point. The weighted pooled effect size for all the studies was 1.12 (95% CI -0.71 to 2.95).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Four RCTs including a total of 34 patients with MMN were suitable for this systematic review. <BR/>Patients treated with IVIg did not improve significantly more often in disability than patients treated with placebo. In contrast, the number of patients with a significant improvement in muscle strength was significantly higher after IVIg therapy than after placebo.</P>
<P>It was anticipated that different scales would have been used to assess muscle strength in different trials. For this reason we calculated effect sizes for each study and weighted pooled effect sizes. Effect sizes are a dimensionless measure of effect for continuous data which are useful in combining results of individual studies in which the same outcome is measured with different instruments or scales. According to Cohen's guideline (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>), effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 correspond to a small, medium, and large effect. The mean muscle strength did not change significantly after IVIg treatment compared to placebo.<BR/>The number of patients with a sustained significant improvement in disability was not assessed or reported in any of the trials. A higher, but not significant, proportion of patients had at least one conduction block resolved after IVIg treatment as compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Taken together these results show that IVIg treatment is superior to placebo in inducing an improvement in muscle strength in patients with MMN. Muscle strength improved spontaneously in 1 out of 27 cases (4%), but treatment with IVIg increased this chance of improvement to 78% (21 out of 27 patients). This absolute risk difference of 74% gives a number needed to treat of 1.4. The percentage of patients who improved in disability was 39% in the IVIg treatment group and 11% in the placebo group (statistically not significantly different). </P>
<P>This difference in effect when outcome was measured at the disability level or at the impairment level is not surprising since only 34 patients were studied. The power of the included studies together to detect a significant difference at the disability level between treated and untreated patients is low. </P>
<P>Another reason for the divergent results could be the fact that the disability scales used in the three trials are not reliable and tailored for use in MMN patients and are unresponsive to change.</P>
<P>Three different disability scales were used: the modified Norris scale (<LINK REF="STD-Azulay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Azulay 1994</LINK>), the modified Rankin scale (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>), and a self-evaluation scale scored from 0 (normal) to 5 (impossible) for five motor activities of daily life, chosen for each patient together with the examiner at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>). The Norris scale which evaluates limb function was designed for ALS assessment and is a combined disability and impairment scale (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1974</LINK>). The combination of disability and impairment in one scale frustrates the clinical interpretation of changes on such a scale and should be avoided. Furthermore, this scale has not been evaluated for use in MMN patients. The modified Rankin score measures disability and this scale has been shown to be reliable and valid in assessing patients with neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 1999</LINK>). However, whether this also is true for MMN patients with predominantly upper limb and focal involvement has not been investigated. The disability scale used by Léger et al. seems to be more tailored for use in MMN patients. However, this scale has not been formally evaluated for reliability, validity, responsiveness and inter- and intra-rater variability in MMN patients.<BR/>In clinical phase III trials the primary outcome should be disability and not impairment as the primary question to be answered is whether a patient benefits from a particular treatment. From this point of view there is lack of evidence that MMN patients will benefit from IVIg treatment. However, since weakness is the only determinant of disability in patients with MMN, it is to be expected that in patients whose muscle strength improves after IVIg treatment, disability will improve as well. </P>
<P>Most side effects of IVIg are mild and transient and estimated to occur in 1 to 15% of infusions (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eijkhout-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkhout 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wittstock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittstock 2003</LINK>). Rashes, chills, fever, mild hypo- or hypertension, nausea, malaise, headache and mild arthralgias seem to be the most frequent. Occasionally a short-lasting aseptic meningitis may occur without or with only minimal long-term sequelae. The most worrisome albeit rare complications are that of a severe and potentially fatal anaphylactic shock, stroke, and temporary renal impairment, which is relatively common in those patients with pre-existing renal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 2003</LINK>). The exact incidence of these severe side effects is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2003</LINK>). In an ongoing postmarketing clinical pharmacovigilance study an adverse reaction rate of less than 0.5% for more than 26,000 patient infusions and less than 4% in 2,554 patients has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>). In this review, mild, transient side effects were reported in 71% of IVIg treated patients which is far more than has been reported in the 'non-randomised' literature (<LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1996</LINK>).

So far, 487 MMN patients of whom 383 were treated with IVIg, are described. An improvement in impairment (most often muscle strength) has been reported in 303 out 373 IVIg treated patients (81.2%); an improvement in disability has been reported in 91 out of 123 IVIg treated patients (74.0%). As one would expect on the basis of publication bias, IVIg has a beneficial effect in all cases if the total number of reported patients in a paper is lower or equal to seven. In case series with higher numbers of patients the response rate is often lower than 100%. The randomised placebo-controlled trials show that IVIg treatment has an effect on impairment in a comparable number of cases as in the non-randomised literature.</P>
<P>The prevalence of anti-GM1 antibodies in patients with MMN varies considerably between studies, ranging between 30 and 80% (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willison 2002</LINK>). These antibodies are not specific to MMN and can be found in various other immune-mediated neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Furthermore, it has been shown that antibody titres do not correlate with clinical severity over time (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 1998</LINK>). Elevated anti-GM1 antibodies have been suggested to be a reliable predictor of a favourable response after IVIg treatment (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg-V 2000a</LINK>). However, a considerable number of patients lack these antibodies but do respond favourably to IVIg treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Azulay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azulay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bouche-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouche 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg 1995a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most patients with MMN the effect of IVIg only lasts for a few weeks and maintenance treatment with periodic IVIg infusions for extended periods of time seems indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Azulay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azulay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00e9_ger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Léger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meucci-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meucci 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg-V 2002a</LINK>). The maintenance treatment regimes range from 0.4 g/kg once a week to 1 to 2 g/kg given over two or five days monthly or are guided by the response. If initial treatment with IVIg is effective, IVIg maintenance therapy appears to remain effective for a few years but in some patients only for a few months (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1994</LINK>). However, the effectiveness usually declines during prolonged treatment requiring increasing dose and/or higher frequency of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Terenghi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terenghi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Berg_x002d_V-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">van den Berg-V 2002a</LINK>). This long-term decline in effectiveness is probably due to ongoing axonal degeneration which is reflected in progressive reduction of CMAP amplitudes and decreased muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Terenghi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terenghi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 1998</LINK>). In a recent published retrospective study, treatment with higher than normal maintenance doses of IVIg promoted reinnervation, decreased the number of conduction blocks and prevented axonal degeneration in 10 MMN patients up to twelve years (<LINK REF="REF-Vucic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vucic 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of a lack of alternative therapies with an acceptable side effect profile, it seems warranted to try a full course of IVIg in a MMN patient. Patient response should be closely monitored to determine whether the daily life activities of the patient are importantly influenced by the improvement in muscle strength. </P>
<P>Cost-utility analyses of IVIg used in MMN patients have not been published. In CIDP a cost-utility study has been done showing that IVIg, compared with prednisolone, is likely to be cost-effective in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-McCrone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrone 2003</LINK>). However, it was also shown that this cost-effectiveness was greatly dependent on the price and the amount of IVIg administered. Furthermore, corticosteroids are not used in MMN. These factors make it uncertain whether the outcome of this study can be extrapolated to the MMN population.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials shows a non-significant trend towards improvement in disability after intravenous immunoglobulin compared with placebo. There was a significant improvement in muscle strength. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is needed to discover whether intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability and is cost-effective.</P>
