<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-04-30 12:54:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the past decades, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy followed by surgery has become standard treatment for advanced rectal cancer. Chemotherapy is often added, because it enhances the effect of radiotherapy. Another method to amplify radiotherapy is heating the tumor (hyperthermia). In larger tumours there are often regions with a low oxygen concentration. Low oxygen concentrations may hamper the effect of radiotherapy. Hyperthermia can overcome this problem and is able to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. This systematic review of the literature was done to study the additional value of hyperthermia if added to radiotherapy in advanced rectal cancer,</P>
<P>Six studies were found in which 520 patients were included. Of them 258 patients were treated with radiotherapy only and 262 with the combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Four of the six studies containing 424 patients reported overall survival rates (i.e. also patients who died from other causes than cancer were reported). Overall survival after 2 years was significantly better in the group treated with the combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy, but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 years). Five studies reported complete remission rates, i.e. a complete disappearance of the tumour. The chance to develop a complete remission was significantly higher in the combined treated patient group. Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity (that is in general any adverse effect that develops within 3 months during and after treatment). In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between both treatment groups. Late toxicity data (adverse effects that developed during the years following treatment) were not reported.</P>
<P>In conclusion hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. It is not possible to say if this effect is as strong as the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. More well conducted studies are needed to draw firm conclusions.</P>

<P>All identified studies were assessed by two independent reviewers. A weighted estimate of the treatment effect was computed for 2, 3, 4 and 5-year survival, for local tumour recurrence, severe acute and late toxicity and complete tumour response (CR). CR was defined either clinically by disappearance of all pretreatment signs of local tumour or pathologically by microscopically free margins. The risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) were used. Analyses were performed with the Reference Manager (RevMan).</P>

<P>Six RCTs published between 1990 and 2007 were identified. A total number of 520 patients was treated, 258 in the radiotherapy only arm (RT) and 262 in the radiotherapy-hyperthermia arm (RHT). <BR/>Four studies (424 patients) reported overall survival (OS) rates. After 2 years, OS was significantly better in the RHT group (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.33-3.17; p=.001), but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 year OS).<BR/>All but one studies reported CR rates. A significant higher CR rate was observed in the RHT group (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.22-6.45; p=.01).<BR/>Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-11 14:41:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For many years surgery has been the treatment of choice for patients with rectal cancer. The most important prognostic factors are T stage, N stage, the actual number of nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Gunderson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunderson 1974</LINK>) involved, and the distance from the anal verge (<LINK REF="REF-Rich-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 1983</LINK>). During the last decade local and regional recurrences have dropped from 25-50% (<LINK REF="REF-Pilipshen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilipshen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rich-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 1983</LINK>) to 5-12%, mainly due to improved operating techniques, nowadays by performing a total mesorectal excision (<LINK REF="REF-Cawthorn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cawthorn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heald-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heald 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>), thus taking into account the lateral spread of the tumour and lymph nodes. It has been realized, that the circumferential resection margin seems to play an important predictive role in the occurrence of a local recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-deHaas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">deHaas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marijnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marijnen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quirke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quirke 1986</LINK>). In addition to better operating techniques, further improvements in local control and survival have been made possible by the additional use of adjuvant radiotherapy. Randomized controlled trials have recently been able to show the superiority of preoperative chemo- radiation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stockholm-Rectal-Cancer-Study-Group-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockholm Rectal Cancer Study Group 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahl-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-P_x00e5_hlman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Påhlman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauer 2004</LINK>) compared to postoperative chemo-radiation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gastrointestinal-Tumor-Study-Group-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krook 1991</LINK>). This has led to the recently revised recommendations, now suggesting preoperative chemo-radiation therapy followed by a total mesorectal excision as the standard treatment of choice for the majority of all patients diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer.<BR/>Preoperative staging was not routinely used in the past and earlier staging techniques have also been unable to specifically differentiate between small and locally advanced rectal cancers (<LINK REF="REF-deLange-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">deLange 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulsmans-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulsmans 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnall 1994</LINK>). During the last few years however, significant progress has been made in the use of modern MRI and CT techniques to better predict the tumour stage and the circumferential resection margin (<LINK REF="REF-Beets_x002d_Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beets-Tan 2001</LINK>). This has enabled an upfront selection of locally advanced tumours (T3/ T4 and /or N2) with high relapse rates, thus facilitating a more tailored preoperative strategy. This has produced an increasing interest directed towards a more aggressive preoperative treatment in order to downsize or even eradicate the tumour. The use of preoperative radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy can significantly improve the likelihood of microscopically free resection margins and even result in pathologic complete remissions, which might potentially allow to omit surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Habr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauer 2004</LINK>).<BR/>In line with these preoperative treatment developments, the use of hyperthermia (HT) in combination with radiotherapy (RT) has come to the forefront, because hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy may reach equivalent results than concurrent chemo-radiation. This is because hyperthermia is known to especially improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in hypoxic tumours. With increasing tumour volumes the oxygenation status worsens, and as a result the percentage of tumour necrosis increases. This oxygenation status of a tumour, the tumour hypoxia grade, is known to represent an independent prognostic factor (<LINK REF="REF-Brizel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brizel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hockel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hockel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wouters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wouters 2002</LINK>) for local control. Techniques or hyperthermia vary widely. It can be given interstitially, external or intracavitary, the aim is to reach temperatures in the tumour of 41 or above*C.The potential benefit of combining HT and RT has been pointed out several times, mostly in cervical cancer, but its role in rectal cancer has not been defined yet.<BR/>Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to investigate the possible role of hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.</P>

<P>All titles and abstracts of reports identified by electronic searches or handsearching are assessed to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria by three independent reviewers (JvZ, JB, GL). In a consensus meeting (GVM, DDH, LL, JB, GL) discrepancies were discussed. Furthermore, if necessary the full journal papers were screened to identify study characteristics. Of the included studies two reviewers (DDH, JB) assessed the methodological quality against pre-determined criteria (see below), the treatment characteristics (radiotherapy, hyperthermia, chemotherapy) and the results of outcome measures (defined in section type of outcome measure). In addition, the following data were collected from the manuscript: identifiers (authors, title of publication, journal name and citation), tumour characteristics (recurrent, primary, inoperable, metastasis and maximum tumour diameter), baseline characteristics of study population (gender, age, WHO performance status at the time of randomisation, initial disease stage), treatment allocated and number of patients randomised. The results and discrepancies of the data extraction were discussed in different meetings (GVM, DDH, LL, JB). The quality of the hyperthermia treatment of the different studies were discussed in a meeting (JvZ, GVM, DDH, LL, JB). The quality of hyperthermia treatment was described by JvZ.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality was assessed according to the following criteria:</B>
<BR/>- Was the randomisation process adequate?<BR/>- Was there adequate allocation concealment?<BR/>- Were the analyses performed according to intention to treat?<BR/>- Were the groups similar at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators?<BR/>- Were eligibility criteria specified?<BR/>- Were losses to follow up fully accounted for ?<BR/>- Was the withdrawal/drop-out rate unlikely to cause bias?<BR/>- Were co-interventions which may have influenced the results controlled for?<BR/>These single quality criteria were summarized to a summary quality score for each identified study (ranging from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 8).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis </B>
<BR/>A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across studies was computed for the study outcomes. The risk ratio (RR) was used as the effect measure. The hazard ratio (HR), is used as effect measure for the survival analyses. Chi-square heterogeneity tests will be used to test for statistical heterogeneity among trials. As we anticipated that the trial results were heterogeneous, all analyses were performed using a random-effects model.</P>

<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> summarizes the process of inclusion of the studies for this review. Of the 188 studies that were selected by the performed search, we excluded 162 studies because they were not relevant for our review. These studies did not evaluate the interventions of interest (n=8) or did not contain data of colorectal patient characteristics (n=44). In addition, a total of 110 studies were also excluded due to their study characteristics: no randomised clinical trial (n=64), reviews (n=30) and phase 1-2 trials (n=16). Of the remaining 26 studies, 20 studies were excluded (see table characteristics excluded studies). Ten of these studies appeared to be no randomised (n=12) and two additional studies were reviews (n=2). 
<BR/>
The remaining 12 studies were randomised, controlled trials (phase 2 or 3) reporting radiotherapy together with a hyperthermia treatment in one arm and radiotherapy alone in the other arm. Six of these RCT were excluded from this review; for the following reasons; two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kouloulias-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kouloulias 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Savchenko-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Savchenko 1987</LINK>) did not report data on colorectal patients, two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Emami_x002c_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emami,1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hildebrandt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hildebrandt 2006</LINK>) did not report their outcome data separate for colorectal patients and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Furuta-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Furuta 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schulze-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schulze 2006</LINK>) did not report relevant outcome data.

<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>Six studies were identified (see table characteristics of included studies). Four were single centre (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakehi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kakehi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>) and the two others (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>) were multi centre trials. From these 6 studies, four were suitable for 2 and 3 year survival analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>). Four year survival was only reported by Berdov and van de Zee (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>). Five year OS data was only reported by Berdov (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>). Complete tumour responses were reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>) Kakehi reported only partial responses. Acute toxicity data are given by Berdov 1990, Trotter and Van der Zee. Late toxicity data were reported by van der Zee only.</P>
<P>Berdov 1990 (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>) randomised 115 primary T4N0MO rectal cancer patients to receive either preoperative radiotherapy or thermoradiotherapy. The radiotherapy given in both study arms consisted of 40 Gy in 10 fractions given 3 times a week; local hyperthermia was given by electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 915 MHz reaching temperatures of 42-43ºC lasting 60 minutes, 4 till 5 times. The hyperthermia was applied 10 minutes before radiotherapy from the third fraction onwards.<BR/>Pathologic complete tumour responses were obtained in 16.1% in the thermoradiotherapy group versus 1.7% in the radiotherapy alone group (p&lt;0.05). Acute toxicity data were the same in both groups (thermoradiotherapy 33.9%, radiotherapy 35.9%), however no grading of toxicity was given. The 2, 3 4 and year OS data were 48.1, 30.3 , 25.0 and 21.4%. in the thermoradiotherapy group and 16.9 ,15.0, 11.8 and 11.8% in the radiotherapy alone group (p&lt;0.05).</P>
<P>Berdov 1996 (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>) randomised 93 patients with locally advanced (T2-4,N0-X, M0-1) rectal cancer. 48 Patients got thermoradiotherapy and 45 patients radiotherapy alone. All patients got adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU). Total doses of 40 Gy in 10 fractions 3 times a week were given in the fist part of treatment, with hyperthermia from the 3rd to 7th fraction. After a break of 4 weeks hyperfractionated daily RT of 1 Gy and 1.5 Gy with 4h interval was applied till 30-40 Gy. So total doses of 70-80 Gy were given. Response rates are reported after TD 40 Gy and after TD 70-80 Gy. Complete tumour responses were reported in 8 (17%) and 15 (31%) patients respectively in the TRT group versus 0 and 3 patients (7%) in the radiotherapy alone arm. Partial response were seen in 36 (75%) and 33 (69%) patients after 40 and 70-80 Gy in the TRT arm and in 10 (22%) and 22 (49%) patients in the RT arm. 2 and 3 year-OS in the non-metastasised patients was 36 and 17 % in the TRT group versus 20 and 8 % in th RT alone group (p=0.072). Local recurrence free survival was better in the TRT group than in the RT alone group (p=0.041). No data on toxicity were given.</P>
<P>Kakehi (<LINK REF="STD-Kakehi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kakehi 1990</LINK>) reported on 14 patients randomised to receive either preoperative or thermoradiotherapy. Five patients got 40 Gy in 20 fractions of 2 Gy; nine 9 patients got the same radiotherapy with a total of 10 hyperthermia sessions twice weekly thereafter with intracavitary temperatures above 42°C lasting for 40-50 minutes.<BR/>Partial responses defined as more than 50% reduction of the initial tumour volume were reported in 100% of the thermoradiotherapy group versus 20% (1/5) in the control group. No data on OS nor acute and late toxicity are given.</P>
<P>Trotter (<LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>) reported on 73 patients; 9 of these had primary unresectable and 64 recurrent rectal cancer. 23 had metastasised at the time of randomisation. They were randomised to receive either preoperative radiotherapy or thermoradiotherapy. Outcome reported from the whole series.<BR/>The radiotherapy alone consisted of 50 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions over a period of 6 weeks. In the thermoradiotherapy arm radiation consisted of 36-40Gy in 1.5 Gy daily fractions given in a 5-6 weeks period. The hyperthermia was given at two or more days per week, 2 or 3 times lasting 10 minutes with a 30 minutes interval, directly before radiation . The number of hyperthermia treatments varied between 4 till 52 (median 26).<BR/>The median dose in the combined arm was 42.75 Gy in 1.5 Gy daily fractions. Hyperthermia was applied by 12 433 MHz applicators, each delivering up to 200 W.<BR/>Two patients on both arms had a pathological complete response. There was no significant difference in 2, (18% in the thermoradiotherapy arm and 27% in the radiotherapy alone arm) 3 and 4 year overall survival. Acute grade 3-4 toxicity was slightly higher in the thermoradiotherapy arm (15 patients) than in the radiotherapy alone arm (11 patients).</P>
<P>Van der Zee (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>) randomised 143 patients with primary or recurrent rectal cancer. The radiation dose was 46-50 Gy in 1.8-2.3 Gy daily fractions, followed if possible by a boost of 10-24 Gy at the tumour mass. The regional hyperthermia was prescribed once weekly, 1-4 hours after radiotherapy, lasting 60-90 minutes after reaching 42°C for a total of five treatments.<BR/>The complete response rate in the combined treatment arm was 20.8% while this was 15.5% in the radiotherapy alone arm (n.s.) The 2 years overall survival was 36% in the combined arm and 25 % in the radiotherapy alone arm (n.s.), and the 3 years overall survival showed no difference between the two treatment arms. Acute grade 3-4 toxicity did not differ between the two groups (2.2% and 5.9% respectively).</P>
<P>You (<LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>) randomised 82 patients with rectal cancer preoperatively. The radiotherapy alone group got got 30 Gy in 8 daily fractions of 3.75 Gy, twice a week or 40 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions given five times a week. The thermoradiotherapy group got the same radiation either 30 or 40 Gy with endocavitary hyperthermia using 915 MHz microwave applicators. The hyperthermia was applied 30 minutes after radiotherapy twice weekly, in total 6-8 times during 5 min. The temperature reached was 45-50°C at the tumour surface.<BR/>The pathological CR rate was 22.7% in the combined treatment arm versus 5.3% in the radiotherapy alone arm which was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05). Overall survival data are hard to report because nine patients (11%) had metastases at the time of randomisation and not all patients were operated after the given preoperative treatment. Acute toxicity was seen in 14 % of the combined treatment arm versus 8% in the radiotherapy alone arm. Since grade of acute toxicity data were unclear these data could not be further analysed.</P>

In four studies, the groups were similar at baseline for most important prognostic indicators (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>). In the study of van der Zee, baseline differences were reported for the mean size of the pelvic tumour, the haemoglobin level and the percentage of patients with non-resectable or metastatic disease favouring the radiation alone group while two patients in the radiation alone group got hyperthermia. Kaheki (<LINK REF="STD-Kakehi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kakehi 1990</LINK>) did not report on baseline characteristics at all. Two studies (Kaheki and You) did not report the eligibility criteria. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1990</LINK>) of the six studies the number of patients that underwent surgery may have influenced the results.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 14:12:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of combining hyperthermia and radiotherapy for rectal cancer has not been defined yet.<BR/>We therefore conducted a systematic review in order to investigate the possible benefit of added to hyperthermia in patients with rectal cancer.<BR/>We encountered several problems in determining the most adequate hyperthermia treatment to be used as the basic principle for the comparison of the different studies.<BR/>The first and general problem with hyperthermia is that it is not known which temperatures are good enough. In clinical studies showing a benefit of hyperthermia, the applied temperatures are in the range of average 40-41°C, duration per treatment is 40-60 minutes at such temperatures, and the number of treatments is four or more. So according to these criteria only Trotter et al. have used a clearly inadequate technique and an inefficient treatment schedule. The 915 MHz intra-cavitory system as used by Berdow (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>) and You (<LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>)can be adequate for heating tumours that are not deeper than 2 cm from the applicator's surface (or become so during the treatment series). With the apparatus used by van der Zee (BSD-2000 and Amsterdam AMC-4) (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>) adequate regional heating of the pelvic can be achieved.<BR/>The second problem is that in the above discussed articles there is not a clear indication of how and how often the temperature was measured. Berdow (<LINK REF="STD-Berdov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berdov 1996</LINK>) measured temperatures in 7 female patients with carcinoma of the lower part of the rectum extending temperature probes into the vagina. Two thermocouples were inserted into the rectal cancer with distances of 0.5 and 1 cm from the heating antenna. The obtained temperature distribution was used as the basis for optimising temperature regimens in all following patients.<BR/>Trotter (<LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1996</LINK>) monitored tumour temperature reached in only one patient on four separate occasions. Kakehi (<LINK REF="STD-Kakehi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kakehi 1990</LINK>) monitored tumour temperature by direct insertion of a thermo-sensor, a micro-thermocouple, whenever possible. They claimed accuracy of ± .2ºC. It is not mentioned how frequent this was executed. They measured temperatures by thermistors attached to the applicator. Only surface temperatures can be measured in this way. Van der Zee (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>) does not mention how temperature measurement was performed .<BR/>Overall, it is difficult to comment precisely on the quality of the given hyperthermic treatment.<BR/>Third problem is that the given preoperative radiotherapy schedules are very different from the nowadays often used schedules (50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions in five-six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Bujko-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bujko 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauer 2004</LINK>). Preoperative radiotherapy at biologically effective dose &gt; 30Gy reduces the risk of local recurrence and marginally the risk of death from rectal cancer but the rate of apparently curative resection was not improved (<LINK REF="REF-CCCG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCG 2001</LINK>). So there should definitely be a role for increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy alone.</P>
<P>Hyperthermia is believed to increase the radiosensitivity especially for hypoxic, nutrient deprived cells in low pH environment. The cytotoxic effects are increased, but this radiosensitizing effect is also seen in combined radiation and chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gerard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerard 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pietrzak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrzak 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauer 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Since we were afraid to combine potentially toxic treatments concomitantly there is a theoretical advantage of combining hyperthermia and radiation over combining chemotherapy and radiation. The given data on acute toxicity of thermo-radiation can be convincing, but hardly any data on long term toxicity are known. These are only reported by van de Zee (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Zee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van der Zee 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Sauer et al(<LINK REF="REF-Sauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauer 2004</LINK>) published on acute and long term toxicity of chemoradiation given either pre or postoperatively. Acute and late grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in 27% and 14 % respectively of preoperatively treated patients. Pietrzak (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrzak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrzak 2007</LINK>) compared preoperative 5 times 5 Gy versus preoperative chemoradiation. Acute radiation toxicity was higher in the chemoradiation group (18 versus 3 %, p&lt;0.0001) but there was no difference in severe late toxicity (10 versus 7% (p=0.36). Gerard (<LINK REF="REF-Gerard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerard 2006</LINK>) randomised 733 patients to compare preoperative radiotherapy with chemoradiation. Acute grade 3-4 toxicity was more frequent with chemoradiation ( 14.6% versus 2.7%), p&lt;0.05.</P>
<P>Complete response, defined as disappearance of clinical symptoms or as tumour free margins (R0 resections) in operated patients, seems to be better in the combined treatment with hyperthermia. Contradictingly, the local recurrence percentage is higher in the HT group. So the benefit of HT combined therapy seems to be a short one. Moreover, the beneficial effect of hyperthermia does translate in a higher 2-year overall survival rate. However, the 3-year, 4- year and 5-year rates were not significantly different between the treatment arms. Due to limited data, we were not able to draw firm conclusion about acute of late toxicity.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the overall quality of studies published is poor, prohibiting definitive conclusions regarding the beneficial effect of hyperthermia added to standard radiotherapy. However, this review conclude that adding hyperthermia to radiation in locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer, can lead to higher short term local/pelvic control rates and a short term survival benefit. Little is known about acute and long term morbidity.</P>

<P>To make a firm conclusion further studies are needed to compare chemoradiation versus thermoradiation versus chemoradiation plus hyperthermia in well selected and quality controlled randomised trails. We concluded that the given hyperthermia varied widely which makes comparison of the results very difficult. Also it should be stated that upfront selection of patients with locally advanced cancer by newly techniques (MRI, CT scanning of the abdomen) is mandatory.</P>
