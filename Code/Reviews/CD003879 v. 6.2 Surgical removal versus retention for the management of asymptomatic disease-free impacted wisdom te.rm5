<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review, produced through <A HREF="http://oralhealth.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Oral Health</A>, seeks to assess the effects of removal compared with conservative management of impacted wisdom teeth, in the absence of symptoms and without evidence of local disease, in adolescents and adults. This is an update of an existing review published in 2012.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 26 years. These are the last teeth to erupt, and they normally erupt into a position closely behind the last standing teeth (second molars). Space for these teeth to erupt can be limited. Wisdom teeth often fail to erupt or erupt only partially, which is often due to impaction of the wisdom teeth against the second molars (teeth directly in front of the wisdom teeth). In most cases, this occurs when second molars are blocking the path of eruption of third molar teeth and act as a physical barrier, preventing complete eruption. An impacted wisdom tooth is called asymptomatic and disease-free in the absence of signs and symptoms of disease affecting the wisdom tooth or nearby structures.</P>
<P>Impacted wisdom teeth can cause swelling and ulceration of the gums around the wisdom teeth, damage to the roots of second molars, decay in second molars, gum and bone disease around second molars and development of cysts or tumours. General agreement exists that removal of wisdom teeth is appropriate if signs or symptoms of disease related to the wisdom teeth are present. Less agreement exists about the appropriate management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature up to May 2016 and found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one prospective cohort study to include in this review. These studies involved 493 participants in total. The RCT conducted at a dental hospital in the UK included 77 adolescent male and female participants, and the cohort study conducted at a private dental clinic in the USA involved 416 men aged 24 to 84 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Available evidence is insufficient to show whether or not asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed.</P>
<P>One study at serious risk of bias provided very low quality evidence suggesting that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth is associated with increased risk of periodontitis (infection of the gums) affecting the adjacent second molar (teeth directly in front of the wisdom teeth) in the long term. In the same study, no evidence was found to suggest that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth increases the risk of caries affecting the adjacent second molar.</P>
<P>Another study, also at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the dental arch.</P>
<P>The included studies did not measure our primary outcome - health-related quality of life. Nor did they measure our secondary outcomes - costs, other adverse events associated with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) and adverse effects associated with their removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence provided by the two studies included in this review is of low to very low quality, so we cannot rely on these findings. High-quality research is urgently needed to support clinical practice in this area. In light of the lack of available evidence, patient values should be considered and clinical expertise used when treatment decisions are made with patients who have asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. If the decision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-09 12:46:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth is surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the absence of symptoms and with no evidence of local disease. Impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with pathological changes, such as pericoronitis, root resorption, gum and alveolar bone disease (periodontitis), caries and the development of cysts and tumours. When surgical removal is carried out in older people, the risk of postoperative complications, pain and discomfort is increased. Other reasons to justify prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted third molars have included preventing late lower incisor crowding, preventing damage to adjacent structures such as the second molar or the inferior alveolar nerve, in preparation for orthognathic surgery, in preparation for radiotherapy or during procedures to treat people with trauma to the affected area. Removal of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth is a common procedure, and researchers must determine whether evidence supports this practice. This review is an update of an existing review published in 2012.</P>

<P>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 May 2016) and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 May 2016).

<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We found only low to very low quality evidence of the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth for a limited number of secondary outcome measures.</P>
<P>One prospective cohort study, reporting data from a subgroup of 416 healthy male participants, aged 24 to 84 years, compared the effect of the absence (previous removal or agenesis) against the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on periodontitis and caries associated with the distal of the adjacent second molar during a follow-up period of three to over 25 years. Very low quality evidence suggests that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontitis affecting the adjacent second molar in the long term. In the same study, which is at serious risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference in caries risk associated with the presence or absence of impacted wisdom teeth.</P>
<P>One RCT with 164 randomised and 77 analysed adolescent participants compared the effect of extraction with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on dimensional changes in the dental arch after five years. Participants (55% female) had previously undergone orthodontic treatment and had 'crowded' wisdom teeth. No evidence from this study, which was at high risk of bias, was found to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has a clinically significant effect on dimensional changes in the dental arch.</P>
<P>The included studies did not measure our other secondary outcomes: costs, other adverse events associated with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) and adverse effects associated with their removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-25 14:48:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether or not asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed. Although asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontitis affecting adjacent second molars in the long term, the evidence is of very low quality. Well-designed RCTs investigating long-term and rare effects of retention and removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, in a representative group of individuals, are unlikely to be feasible. In their continuing absence, high quality, long-term prospective cohort studies may provide valuable evidence in the future. Given the lack of available evidence, patient values should be considered and clinical expertise used to guide shared decision making with patients who have asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. If the decision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals to prevent undesirable outcomes is advisable.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-29 14:51:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 26 years (<LINK REF="REF-Venta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 2001</LINK>). More than other teeth, wisdom teeth can fail to erupt or can erupt only partially, with a worldwide impaction prevalence of 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2015</LINK>). Impaction occurs when complete eruption into a normal functional position is prevented and completion of root growth is fully established. This can be due to lack of space (in the mouth), obstruction by another tooth or development in an abnormal position (<LINK REF="REF-Venta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venta 1999</LINK>). A tooth that is completely impacted can be entirely covered by soft tissue, covered partially by bone and soft tissue or completely covered by bone. Partial eruption occurs when the tooth is visible in the dental arch but has not erupted into a normal functional position (<LINK REF="REF-RCS-England-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCS England 1997</LINK>). Impacted wisdom teeth have been associated with pathological changes such as pericoronitis, root resorption, periodontal disease, caries and development of cysts or tumours. An impacted wisdom tooth is called 'trouble-free' if the patient does not experience signs or symptoms of associated pain or discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Song-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 1997</LINK>). Other terms used in the literature include 'disease-free' and 'asymptomatic' (<LINK REF="REF-Dodson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodson 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted third molars varies widely and is influenced by age, sex and ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1996</LINK>). Impaction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw is more common than in the upper jaw (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Celikoglu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celikoglu 2010</LINK>). Most of the difficulties that follow surgical removal, such as postoperative morbidity, pain, discomfort and restricted activity, are related to lower wisdom teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Bienstock-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bienstock 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>When an impacted wisdom tooth cause pathological changes or pain, the tooth is no longer trouble-free. General agreement indicates that a wisdom tooth should be removed if pathology or symptoms are present. However, the management of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Kandasamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandasamy 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-25 09:53:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth is defined as the surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the absence of symptoms and with no evidence of local disease. Many dentists and their patients believe that removal of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth is justified to avoid future complications associated with these teeth. When surgical removal is carried out on older patients, the risk of postoperative complications is increased (<LINK REF="REF-Brokaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brokaw 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chuang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercier-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercier 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tate-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tate 1994</LINK>). An impacted wisdom tooth almost never has a functional role in the mouth and might increase risks of caries, periodontal disease and external root resorption associated with the adjacent second molar (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oenning-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oenning 2015</LINK>). Another argument often given for the removal of asymptomatic wisdom teeth is to prevent late lower incisor crowding.</P>
<P>Removal of impacted wisdom teeth is a common surgical procedure with significant associated costs (<LINK REF="REF-Renton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renton 2012</LINK>). Short-term adverse effects of the removal of wisdom teeth include temporary nerve damage, alveolar osteitis (dry socket), infection, secondary haemorrhage, pain, swelling and trismus (restricted mouth opening). Long-term adverse effects of third molar surgery are uncommon but can include permanent nerve damage (in up to 1% of cases) and damage to adjacent teeth during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kandasamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandasamy 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Retention of impacted wisdom teeth is defined as monitoring the status of wisdom teeth. To avoid adverse effects and the cost of removal of wisdom teeth, some advocate retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>). This approach requires individuals to have regular dental reviews or 'checkups', so that the status of the wisdom teeth can be monitored.</P>

<P>In many countries, prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth, whether impacted or fully erupted, was long considered as 'appropriate care' (<LINK REF="REF-Brokaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brokaw 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tate-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tate 1994</LINK>). Removal of wisdom teeth that may remain disease-free indefinitely is costly (<LINK REF="REF-Renton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renton 2012</LINK>) and can produce an unnecessary burden on healthcare resources (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>).

However, concerns include the possibility that retained wisdom teeth will increase the risk of pathology to surrounding structures in the long term, and that their removal at an older age may cause more frequent and severe complications (<LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renton 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>We assessed the carry-over effect for all split-mouth studies. If a split-mouth design was deemed inappropriate for investigating the outcome or outcomes assessed in a particular study, we excluded the study. If we had included split-mouth studies, we intended to approximate a paired analysis, as recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In the case of an ideal study (i.e. one that reported means and SDs for both groups, and MDs and SDs/standard errors (SEs) between two groups), we intended to calculate intragroup correlation co-efficients (ICCs); if we identified more than one ideal study, we intended to calculate the mean ICC, which we would have adopted in calculating the MD and SD/SE for other, similar split-mouth studies. If no ideal study was identified, then we assumed that the ICC was 0.5.</P>
<P>For clustered data, in trials where the unit of analysis was the tooth, and the number of teeth included in the trial was not more than twice the number of participants, we treated the data as if the unit of analysis was the individual.

If we could not obtain the protocol,we compared outcomes listed in the methods section with those whose results were reported. If non-significant results were mentioned but were not reported adequately, we considered that bias was likely to occur in a meta-analysis, and we sought further information from the authors of study reports. Otherwise, we noted this meta-analysis as having high risk of bias. If information was insufficient to judge the risk of bias, we noted this meta-analysis as having unclear risk of bias. If any meta-analysis had included a sufficient number of trials (more than 10), we would have assessed publication bias according to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry, as described in Section 10.4 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

GRADE guidance states that RCTs are considered to present high quality evidence and are downgraded as necessary on the basis of overall risk of bias of included studies, directness of the evidence, consistency of the results, precision of the estimates, risk of publication bias and magnitude of effect.

<P>We have reported risk of bias separately for the RCT and the prospective cohort study. See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Harradine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harradine 1998</LINK>) had adequate sequence generation. Study authors did not explicitly describe the method of allocation concealment, and this gave rise to high risk of selection bias. It was impossible for participants and operators to be blinded to the intervention, but the outcome assessor was blinded. We assessed risk of performance and detection bias to be low. Fifty-three per cent of the original participants (N = 87) were lost to follow-up at five years. More participants were lost from the retention group (49/82 = 60%) than from the removal group (38/82 = 46%), and study authors were unable to contact these participants. study authors provided no data on the gender balance between groups of those who completed the study compared with those who did not. We assessed this trial to be at high risk of attrition bias, which could have affected overall results. We assessed risk of bias due to selective reporting as unclear. We could identify no other major potential sources of bias. We considered this RCT to be at high risk of bias overall.</P>
<P>We assessed the prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Nunn-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nunn 2013</LINK>) to be at serious risk of bias owing to confounding and missing data. Study authors adjusted analyses for baseline age, smoking status, education and baseline second molar measures but did not measure oral health status. These factors may contribute to the development of second molar pathology; therefore this study is at serious risk of bias owing to confounding. In the first Dental Longitudinal Study, beginning in 1969, 1231 volunteers were enrolled (<LINK REF="REF-Kapur-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapur 1972</LINK>). Eventually only 416 met the inclusion criteria and were analysed. Data regarding the excluded participants are missing. Participants with pathology associated with their wisdom teeth are likely to have had them removed before the study was initiated; therefore, this study is at serious risk of bias owing to missing data. We assessed this study to be at low risk of bias in measurement of interventions and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias due to selection of participants into the study, departures from intended interventions and selection of reported results as moderate. We considered this prospective cohort study overall to be at serious risk of bias for all assessed outcomes. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-26 13:41:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No eligible studies in this review reported the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth for the primary outcome measure: health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>Studies have provided only low or very low quality evidence of the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth for a limited number of secondary outcome measures. Very low quality evidence from one prospective cohort study suggests that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontitis associated with the adjacent second molar in the long term. The same study provided no evidence to suggest that the presence of impacted wisdom teeth changes the risk of caries affecting the adjacent second molar. Low quality evidence from a single randomised controlled trial (RCT) included in this review found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has a clinically significant effect on dimensional changes in the dental arch.</P>
<P>No included studies have reported other outcomes or adverse events associated with removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection) or retention (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-26 13:29:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Substantial differences are evident between participants in the two included studies, and these participants are not representative of the general population with asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. </P>
<P>The included RCT focused only on adolescent patients who had completed orthodontic treatment. Loss to follow-up was a major obstacle in obtaining data about the effects of extraction of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, as participants are likely to be recruited towards the end of their high school years and are difficult to follow up as they move to higher education, go travelling or change locations when seeking employment. </P>
<P>The prospective cohort study included only male participants aged 24 to 84 years from a single geographic area who were self selected volunteers. Participants enrolled in the study who returned for follow-up are likely to be more health aware than their age-matched peers in the community and to practise better health behaviours. This would suggest that participants in this study were more motivated than the overall population. Retained wisdom teeth in this group of participants were associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting the adjacent second molar. Risk of damage to the second molar might be even greater in populations with poor oral health. If wisdom teeth or adjacent second molars need to be removed at an older age owing to disease, the personal and financial costs may be greater than at a young age. However, included studies have provided no information on quality of life measures and costs.</P>
<P>Included studies have provided no information regarding other adverse effects of removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection) or retention (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.</P>
<P>We chose the primary outcome of health-related quality of life to capture the benefits and harms associated with removal and retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. We chose this outcome measure because of the difficulties of comparing various outcomes (e.g. rate of complications after surgical removal, incidence of pathological change in cases of retention, rate of complications due to delayed surgical removal) (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2000</LINK>). Unfortunately, the included studies did not assess this primary outcome. The Oral Health Impact Profile is a valid and reliable measure of oral health-related quality of life in general dental practice and is responsive to impacted third molar clinical change (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandes 2006</LINK>). It is suitable for measuring the effects of removal or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on oral health-related quality of life in future studies.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-29 15:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single RCT included in this review provided low quality evidence of the effects of surgical removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on dimensional changes in the dental arch at five years' follow-up. We considered this trial to be at high risk of bias overall owing to limitations of allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data sufficient to lower confidence in the estimate of effect. In addition, the small number of participants and the high rate of loss of participants to follow-up led to imprecision in the estimate of effect.</P>
<P>As RCTs investigating longer-term and rare effects of removal or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are unlikely to be feasible, we considered non-randomised studies (NRSs) for inclusion in this review update. A high quality prospective cohort study might be a more suitable design for evaluating the outcomes of retained wisdom teeth. However, NRSs are likely to be at higher risk of bias compared with RCTs. With the introduction of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for NRSs (ACROBAT-NRSI, <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2014</LINK>), it is possible to assess the risk of bias in NRSs more systematically. (The tool was updated in 2016 and is now called ROBINS-I).</P>
<P>We assessed the included prospective cohort study, <LINK REF="STD-Nunn-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nunn 2013</LINK>, to be at serious risk of bias because of confounding. Study authors adjusted the analyses for baseline age, smoking status, education and baseline second molar measures but did not measure oral health status. Oral health status may contribute to the development of pathology associated with wisdom teeth and adjacent second molars. A recent study that measured the frequency of dental checkups reported no effects of wisdom tooth removal on the incidence of pathology associated with the second molar (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2014</LINK>). However, this study provided only two years of follow-up and was not eligible for inclusion in this review. As pathology may develop in a wisdom tooth or in the adjacent second molar over the whole of a person&#8217;s lifetime, studies with long-term follow-up are needed.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence available from the two studies included in this review is of low to very low quality, so we cannot rely on these findings to support clinical practice.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-11 20:50:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the lack of evidence, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the management of impacted wisdom teeth have been available for 15 years. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1999</LINK>) published a CPG for the management of unerupted and impacted wisdom teeth in 1999, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>) in the UK published a CPG for removal of wisdom teeth in 2000. Both concluded that in light of the costs and risks associated with removal, no valid evidence supports the prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth. In 2000, the number of patients requiring surgical removal of wisdom teeth in secondary care dropped by 30% (<LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2012</LINK>). However, since 2003, an increase in the removal of wisdom teeth has been registered, with equal numbers of patients requiring wisdom tooth removal in 2000 and 2010. In addition, the mean age of patients requiring removal of wisdom teeth has increased from 25 years before the introduction of the NICE CPD to 32 years in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2012</LINK>). The review authors suggest that implementation of CPGs has not resulted in a reduction in the number of wisdom teeth removed but has increased the number of wisdom teeth requiring removal at an older age owing to caries (<LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renton 2012</LINK>). However, risk of bias is high in all domains in this study owing to the use of hospital coding systems. The prospective cohort study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Nunn-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nunn 2013</LINK>) found increased risk of distal caries for second molars adjacent to fully erupted wisdom teeth, but not for impacted wisdom teeth.</P>
<P>In the late 1990s, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons acknowledged the absence of evidence to guide clinical decision making for the management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, and allocated a significant amount of money for a multi-centre study (<LINK REF="REF-Kandasamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandasamy 2009</LINK>). More than 70 papers have been published as a result of this study, including a large cohort study that documents the incidence of adverse effects following more than 8000 third molar extractions in patients 25 years of age or older (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2005</LINK>). Large studies have documented the incidence of complications associated with retention of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth. Most of these studies did not focus on asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth but investigated the occurrence of pathology associated with &#8216;visible teeth&#8217;. This resulted in serious risk of selection bias in all of these studies; therefore we did not include them in this review. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons "leans more towards the removal of asymptomatic disease-free third molars on the basis they are associated with increased periodontal probing depths and are therefore a potential source of chronic inflammation" (<LINK REF="REF-Kandasamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandasamy 2009</LINK>). However, it should be questioned whether only pocket depths are indicative of periodontal pathology. A 4-mm pocket depth in the second molar may be influenced by the eruption status of the third molar, without inflammation or other pathology. The prospective cohort study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Nunn-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nunn 2013</LINK>) found increased risk of second molar periodontal pathology adjacent to impacted third molars when distal alveolar bone loss was assessed radiographically in addition to distal probing depths.</P>
<P>Disagreement regarding the removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2014</LINK>), and the key question remains: why should impacted wisdom teeth be removed in the absence of symptoms or pathological conditions? Unfortunately, reliable estimates of the onset of pathology related to retained impacted wisdom teeth are unavailable (<LINK REF="REF-Venta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venta 2004</LINK>), in large part because of the widespread practice of routine removal over past decades. Recently, cross-sectional studies performed in elderly individuals in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2010</LINK>) and Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Venta-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Venta 2015</LINK>) have reported that most wisdom teeth are removed over a lifetime, and that up to 80% of surviving wisdom teeth have associated pathology such as caries or periodontitis in patients over the age of 74 years. The incidence of severe pathology associated with wisdom teeth, such as cysts and tumours, is low (&lt; 2%). Evidence from these cross-sectional studies is very unreliable, and studies assessing the outcomes of retained wisdom teeth are rare because of problems associated with a complex long-term prospective study design (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Sanden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Sanden 2002</LINK>). Studies have shown that distally impacted lower wisdom teeth and partially erupted wisdom teeth are more likely to become symptomatic (<LINK REF="STD-Venta-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Venta 1993a</LINK>). Actuarial lifetime tables have shed some light on the natural history of asymptomatic impacted lower wisdom teeth, but longer follow-up periods are required (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandes 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The decision about whether to recommend removal or retention of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth may be influenced by cost (whether publicly funded, covered through insurance or borne by the patient) and by professional liability. Patient values and preferences should play a more prominent role in deciding whether asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed.</P>

<P>Insufficient evidence is available to support the surgical removal or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. Although some evidence suggests that retaining asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may increase the risk of periodontitis associated with adjacent second molars in the long term, this evidence is of very low quality. In light of the lack of available evidence, patient values should be considered and clinical expertise used to guide shared decision making with patients who have asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. If the decision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals to prevent undesirable outcomes is advisable.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-25 09:25:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-term, well-designed prospective studies comparing removal or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are urgently needed. Well-designed RCTs investigating the long-term and rare effects of retention and removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, in a representative group of individuals, are unlikely to be feasible. If randomisation is not possible, studies should register important baseline data such as age and general and oral health status, including the frequency of dental checkups, the DMFS/T (Decayed Missing Filled Surfaces/Teeth) index or frequency of oral hygiene. These confounding domains should be balanced at baseline or adjusted for with appropriate analyses. A crucial and easily comparable outcome is oral health-related quality of life. However, further development and validation of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are needed in the context of managing asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. The secondary outcomes described in this review are also of great importance for decision making in the management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth and should be measured in future studies. Because pathology may develop in a wisdom tooth or in the adjacent second molar over the whole of a patient&#8217;s lifetime, studies with long-term follow-up (at least five years) are needed. This is very challenging, as young participants are difficult to contact when they move to higher education, travel or change locations while seeking employment.</P>

<LI>Title - we added 'disease-free'.</LI>
<LI>Types of participants. In the original protocol, the intention was to include only studies on adult participants (over 17 years of age). However, review authors identified no suitable trials. It was therefore decided to expand the remit to include studies on adolescent participants. The change in the age of participants is not expected to have any clinical implications because little clinical difference has been noted between adolescents (14 to 17 years of age) and young adults (18 to 25 years of age).</LI>
<LI>Types of studies. Long-term outcomes of retention/removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are extremely unlikely to be studied in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, we considered non-randomised studies (NRSs) for inclusion in this review update, if outcomes were measured with follow-up of at least five years.</LI>
<LI>Types of interventions. Presence and absence of wisdom teeth were added to investigate the long-term outcomes of retention or removal of wisdom teeth. This enabled us to study the effects of absence or presence of wisdom teeth on adjacent structures such as the second molar.</LI>
<LI>Types of outcomes. More than 15 years after the initial protocol, many publications have addressed periodontitis as a possible undesirable effect of retention of wisdom teeth. Furthermore, attention to medication/radiotherapy-related osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with surgical extractions is increasing. Therefore, we added these secondary outcomes to the methods. We expanded other outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Because we considered NRSs for inclusion in the review update, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) for the risk of bias assessment of NRSs (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2014</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>As we were including NRSs, we executed the search without an RCT study design filter, and the results of the full search are reported in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</LI>

<P>Analyses were adjusted for baseline age, smoking status, education and baseline second molar measures. However, oral health status such as oral hygiene and frequency of dental checkups was not measured. These factors may contribute to the development of second molar pathology. However, "participants enrolled in the study returning for follow-ups are likely to be more health aware than their age-matched peers in the community and practice better health behaviors". This would suggest more motivated participants in this study compared with the overall population. Therefore the predicted direction of bias due to oral health status confounding favours retention (presence), and it is likely that the effect estimate would be even higher if was adjusted</P>

<P>Only male volunteers were included. However, gender is not expected to contribute to the development of second molar pathology. Some participants lost third molars before the start of follow-up &#8211; in the target randomised trial for this study, participants would be followed from the time the third molars were removed. As third molars were removed before the start of follow-up, a potentially important amount of follow-up time is missing</P>
