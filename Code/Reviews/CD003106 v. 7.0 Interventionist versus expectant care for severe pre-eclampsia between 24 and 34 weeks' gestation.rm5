<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:50:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women who develop pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) before 34 weeks of pregnancy (early onset) are at risk of severe complications, and even death. These involve the woman's liver, kidneys, clotting system and cause neurological disturbances such as headache, visual disturbances, and exaggerated tendon reflexes. If the placenta is involved, this can cause growth restriction or reduced amniotic fluid, placing the baby at risk. The only known cure for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the baby. Being born too early can in itself have problems for the baby, even with the administration of corticosteroids 24 to 48 hours beforehand to help mature the lungs. Some hospitals follow a policy of early delivery within 24 to 48 hours, interventionist management, whilst others prefer to delay delivery until it is no longer possible to safely stabilise the woman's condition, expectant management.</P>
<P>This review included four trials that randomly assigned women to a policy of interventionist management or expectant management when presenting with severe pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy. A total of 425 women were included in these four trials. Babies born to women allocated to an interventionist approach were more likely to experience adverse effects such as intraventricular haemorrhage and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. They were also more likely to require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and ventilation, have a longer stay in the neonatal unit and weigh less at birth than those babies born to women allocated to an expectant management approach. Women in the interventionist group were also more likely to require caesarean section for delivery. Delaying delivery may therefore be more beneficial for the baby. There are insufficient data, however, for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on most outcomes for the mother and hence the maternal safety of an expectant approach.</P>
<P>This evidence is based on data from only four small trials. Further large trials with long-term follow-up of the children are needed to confirm or refute whether expectant care is better than early delivery for women who suffer from severe pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-10 09:26:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="David Churchill">
<P>Severe pre-eclampsia can cause significant mortality and morbidity for both mother and child, particularly when it occurs remote from term, between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. The only known cure for this disease is delivery. Some obstetricians advocate early delivery to ensure that the development of serious maternal complications, such as eclampsia (fits) and kidney failure are prevented. Others prefer a more expectant approach delaying delivery in an attempt to reduce the mortality and morbidity for the child associated with being born too early.</P>

<P>Four trials, with a total of 425 women are included in this review. Trials were at low risk of bias for methods of randomisation and allocation concealment; high risk for blinding; unclear risk for incomplete outcome data and other bias; and low risk for selective reporting. There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on most outcomes for the mother. For the baby, there is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects on stillbirth or death after delivery (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.71; four studies; 425 women). Babies whose mothers had been allocated to the interventionist group had more intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.14; one study; 262 women), more hyaline membrane disease (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.81; two studies; 133 women), require more ventilation (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.02; two studies; 300 women) and were more likely to have a lower gestation at birth in days (average mean difference (MD) -9.91, 95% CI -16.37 to -3.45; four studies; 425 women), more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.58) and have a longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (average MD 11.14 days, 95% CI 1.57 to 20.72 days; two studies; 125 women) than those allocated an expectant policy. Nevertheless, babies allocated to the interventionist policy were less likely to be small-for-gestational age (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65; two studies; 125 women). Women who had been allocated to the interventionist group were more likely to have a caesarean section (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; four studies; 425 women) than those allocated an expectant policy. There were no statistically significant differences between the two strategies for any other outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:50:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that is usually associated with raised blood pressure and proteinuria, but can also involve the woman's liver, kidneys, clotting system, or brain. If the placenta is involved this may lead to growth restriction or premature birth. Pre-eclampsia is a relatively common complication of pregnancy, and can occur at any time during the second half of pregnancy or in the first few weeks after delivery. Prediction models for adverse maternal outcome have been developed and validated in recent times (<LINK REF="REF-von-Dadelszen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Dadelszen 2011</LINK>), but there is still a paucity of data to guide the clinician on the timing of delivery to ensure safety of both the mother and the baby in the long term. Pre-eclampsia is described in more detail in the generic protocol on interventions for treatment of pre-eclampsia and its consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2009</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:50:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more, and/or a diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or more. To be diagnosed with pre-eclampsia the hypertension has to arise de novo after 20 weeks of pregnancy in combination with proteinuria defined as greater than 300 mg of total protein in a 24-hour urine collection (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1988</LINK>). Recently, proteinuria has been assessed using a spot urine measuring the protein to creatinine ratio. A protein: creatinine ratio of 30 mg/mmol correlates with a 24-hour protein excretion of greater than 300 mg in 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2012</LINK>). This method of estimating the amount of protein being excreted has several advantages over the 24-hour urine collection and has been endorsed in a Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Pre-eclampsia study group consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2003</LINK>). However, pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder and the diagnosis of hypertension and proteinuria is considered to be too restrictive for clinical practice. Clinicians are all too aware that the disease can present in several ways and it is necessary to be vigilant when assessing women with symptoms and signs that are strongly associated with the disease. This has led to a widening of the definition for clinical purposes, to include the following: de novo hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation and new onset of one of the following: a) proteinuria as defined above; b) renal insufficiency (creatinine <U>&gt;</U> 0.09 mmol/L, or oliguria; c) liver disease (raised transaminases and/or severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain); d) neurological problems, convulsions (eclampsia), hyper-reflexia with clonus (involuntary muscular contractions), severe headaches, persistent visual disturbances (scotoma); e) haematological disturbances: thrombocytopenia (reduced numbers of platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemolysis; or f) fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no widely accepted definition of severe pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2009</LINK>). Nevertheless, the features described above in combination with the early onset of the disease between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation, would be considered by most clinicians to represent severe pre-eclampsia. We therefore did not further define nor categorise "severity".</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:01:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Within clinical practice, some units advocate early delivery, which has been referred to as 'aggressive management' (<LINK REF="REF-Sibai-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 1984</LINK>), but in this review the term 'interventionist' is preferred. This means delivery by either induction of labour or caesarean section after corticosteroids have been given to improve fetal lung maturation, which in practice is after 24 to 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 1996</LINK>). Others prefer to give corticosteroids, stabilise the woman's condition and then, if possible, aim to delay delivery. This is usually known as 'expectant management' (<LINK REF="REF-Derham-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derham 1989</LINK>). The greatest dilemma in when to deliver is balancing the risks to mother and baby when the pregnancy is somewhere between 24 to 34 weeks. Early delivery resulting in a very premature baby could lead to more neonatal complications such as respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty in breathing and oxygenation), intraventricular haemorrhage (bleeding into the cavities of the brain) and necrotising enterocolitis (bleeding into the wall of the bowel due to a lack of oxygen). Conversely, delaying delivery in an attempt to allow fetal maturation could place the mother in jeopardy and at risk of multisystem organ failure as outlined above. It also prolongs the time that a fetus is in a potentially hostile in utero environment. This in turn will continue to adversely affect the growth of the fetus and may result in an intrauterine death, from severe hypoxia or an acute event such as an abruption. Although the precise cut offs for gestational age will vary with different settings, before 24 weeks the child has little chance of survival. After 34 weeks the prognosis improves with nearly 100 per cent survival. Between 24 and 34 weeks mortality decreases with increasing gestational age, but especially below 28 weeks there is also considerable risk of survival with severe disability. A structured review of observational studies found that expectant care for severe pre-eclampsia was associated with a prolongation of the pregnancy by between one and two weeks with better outcomes for babies and low risks for the mother. There were fewer neonatal deaths and complications of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-19 16:25:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This difficult clinical dilemma occurs relatively frequently in large units, and currently decisions are based mainly upon personal experience rather than good evidence. There is a great need for reliable data to help inform this decision-making.</P>
<P>Other aspects of care for women with severe pre-eclampsia are dealt with in other reviews. These include drugs for lowering very high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>), prophylactic anticonvulsants (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010</LINK>) and plasma volume expansion (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1999b</LINK>). Prevention of pre-eclampsia is covered by reviews of calcium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>), antiplatelets (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2007</LINK>), salt intake (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2005</LINK>) and magnesium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2001</LINK>).</P>

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an averaged treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

They were either randomised to the interventionist group, which involved immediate delivery by caesarean section or induction, or to the expectant management group, who were managed with hospitalisation and intensive maternal and fetal monitoring.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:54:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Timing the delivery of a very premature infant in the presence of severe pre-eclampsia is a difficult clinical decision. When the mother's life is in danger there is no doubt that delivery is the only correct course of action. This situation is rare. More usually, the risks of maternal morbidity or intrauterine fetal demise, if the pregnancy is continued, have to be constantly balanced against the hazards of prematurity to the fetus if delivered. Most obstetricians would probably be cautious and expedite delivery in favour of the outcome for the mother and being able to guarantee a live baby at delivery. What is not clear is to what level this (if at all), adversely affects the baby.</P>
<P>Only the GRIT study pre-specified fetal assessment parameters as entry criteria into the study. The other studies used fetal assessment to trigger delivery if there was evidence of significant compromise. It is therefore not possible to compare the trials for the condition of the fetuses on trial entry. However it is unlikely that there would have been any clinical differences where this was not formally assessed at trial entry. If there were signs of imminent fetal demise then the women would not have been randomised into the trials. But there is the potential for unseen bias and future trials must include a formal assessment of fetal wellbeing on trial entry.</P>
<P>Currently there are insufficient data to justify any of our prespecified subgroup analyses. These will be included in future updates of this review, when larger trials become available.</P>
<P>It is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this review. However, the evidence is promising that short-term morbidity for the baby may be reduced by a policy of expectant care. This is perhaps surprising given that expectant management increases the length of time a fetus is within the hostile environment, with the potential to adversely affect fetal growth. In fact this is often stated as a reason for intervention. The results of this review suggest otherwise. While the babies in the expectant management group were smaller, their short-term outcomes were better. Before this policy can be recommended in clinical practice, further evidence is required to demonstrate that there is truly a short-term benefit for the baby and that it continues in the longer term. Reassurance is also needed to demonstrate that there is no increase in mortality for the child, or in morbidity for the mother.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:54:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of either management approach on stillbirth or death after delivery. However, there is some evidence from this review to suggest that a policy of delaying delivery reduces the morbidity experienced in the neonatal period of life. Fewer babies had intraventricular haemorrhages, hyaline membrane disease and reduced levels of ventilation in those allocated to expectant management. Babies in this group were also less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and when admitted stayed there for shorter periods of time. There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effect a policy of expectant care had on the mothers health. None of the studies included had sufficient sample size to demonstrate differences in maternal outcome.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-20 10:09:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from this review to recommend a particular management policy for this area of obstetric care. The numbers of participants in the trials is too small to be able to demonstrate differences in most significant (primary) outcomes and where differences are found there is a considerable level heterogeneity or the contribution is from only one trial. The same is true for the analysis of the secondary outcome measures.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:54:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three of the trials included in the review were judged to be at unclear risk of both performance and detection bias. It is not possible to blind personnel and participants to interventions and most outcomes are objective outcomes, and are unlikely to be affected by blinding e.g. death, eclampsia. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mesbah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mesbah 2003</LINK>), was in addition judged to be at risk of attrition bias. The <LINK REF="STD-GRIT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">GRIT 2003</LINK> trial was not originally designed to examine severe pre-eclampsia. It looked at interventionist versus expectant management for babies with growth restriction. A by-product of this study, was that a subset of women also had severe pre-eclampsia and it is these women who have been included in the review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These data are insufficient to reach any firm conclusions about the comparative effects of these alternative strategies for the care of women with severe early onset pre-eclampsia. Nevertheless, the apparent increase in some measures of neonatal morbidity associated with interventionist care suggests that early delivery would need to be justified by a realistic expectation of harm to the mother if the pregnancy was continued.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-02-16 15:29:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">Methods used to assess trials included in previous versions of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 11:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Odendaal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Odendaal 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1994</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two review authors assessed potentially eligible trials for their suitability for inclusion in the review. Decisions regarding inclusion were made separately and results compared. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion. Data were extracted by two authors using an agreed format, and again discrepancies resolved through discussion. If agreement could not be reached that item was excluded until further information was available from the trialists. Data were entered by one author, and double checked by the other.</P>
<P>Validity of each included trial was assessed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Trials were assessed with a grade allocated to each trial on the basis of allocation concealment: A (adequate), B (unclear), or C (clearly inadequate). Where the method of allocation concealment was unclear, attempts were made to contact authors to provide further details. Quasi-randomised designs, such as alternate allocation and use of record numbers, were excluded.</P>
<P>Blinding and completeness of follow-up were assessed for each outcome using the following criteria:</P>
<P>For completeness of follow-up:<BR/>A. less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>B. 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>C. 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded.</P>
<P>Excluded: if not possible to present the data by intention to treat or if more than 20% of participants were excluded.</P>
<P>For blinding of assessment of outcome:<BR/>A. double blind;<BR/>B. single blind;<BR/>C. no blinding or blinding not mentioned.</P>
<P>Excluded: no blinding and the outcome very subjective.</P>
<P>Statistical analyses were carried out using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>) with results presented as summary relative risk, risk difference and number needed to treat. Tests of heterogeneity between trials were applied to assess the significance of any differences between trials and possible causes of any heterogeneity were explored.</P>
<P>Wherever possible, subgroup analyses for the main outcomes were performed by gestation at trial entry (24 to 28 weeks and 29 to 34 weeks), severity of pre-eclampsia (HELLP syndrome or imminent eclampsia and neither of these).</P>
