<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of opioids on pain and function among people with chronic low-back pain (CLBP).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Opioids are pain relievers that act on the central nervous system. People with low-back pain (LBP) use these drugs to relieve pain. We examined whether the use of opioids for at least four weeks was better or worse than other treatments of CLBP.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials, both published and unpublished, up to October 2012. We included fifteen trials which included 5540 participants and compared opioids against a placebo (fake medication) or other drugs that have been used for LBP. Most people included in the trials were aged 40 to 50 years and all reported at least moderate pain across the low-back area. The trials included a slightly higher proportion of women. Most of the trials followed the patients during three months and were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. 젨</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In general, people that received opioids reported more pain relief and had less difficulty performing their daily activities in the short-term than those who received a placebo. However, there is little data about the benefits of opioids based on objective measures of physical functioning. We have no information from randomized controlled trials supporting the efficacy and safety of opioids used for more than four months. Furthermore, the current literature does not support that opioids are more effective than other groups of analgesics for LBP such as anti-inflammatories or antidepressants.</P>
<P>This review partially supports the effectiveness of several opioids for CLBP relief and function in the short-term. However, the effectiveness of prescribing of these medications for long-term use is unknown and should take into consideration the potential for serious adverse effects, complications, and increased risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and deaths.</P>
<P>As expected, side effects are more common with opioids but non-life-threatening with short-term use. Insufficient data prevented making conclusions about the side-effect profile of opioids versus other type of analgesics (for example, antidepressants or anti-inflammatories).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence in this review ranged between "very low" and "moderate". The review results should be interpreted with caution and may not be appropriate in all clinical settings. High quality randomized trials are needed to address the long-term (months to years) risks and benefits of opioid use in CLBP, their relative effectiveness compared with other treatments, and to better understand which people may benefit most from this type of intervention.</P>

<P>The use of opioids in the long-term management of chronic low-back pain (CLBP) has increased dramatically. Despite this trend, the benefits and risks of these medications remain unclear. This review is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-06 11:25:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We electronically searched the Cochrane Back Review Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL, CINAHL and PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from January 2006 to October 2012. We checked the reference lists of these trials and other relevant systematic reviews for potential trials for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-06 11:25:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the use of opioids (as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies) in adults with CLBP that were at least four weeks in duration. We included trials that compared non-injectable opioids to placebo or other treatments. We excluded trials that compared different opioids only.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-06 11:25:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data onto a pre-designed form. We pooled results using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.2. We reported on pain and function outcomes using standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used absolute risk difference (RD) with 95% CI to report adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-20 10:28:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 trials (5540 participants). Tramadol was examined in five trials (1378 participants); it was found to be better than placebo for pain (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.44; <I>low quality evidence</I>) and function (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Transdermal buprenorphine (two trials, 653 participants) may make little difference for pain (SMD -2.47, 95%CI -2.69 to -2.25; <I>very low quality evidence</I>), but no difference compared to placebo for function (SMD -0.14, 95%CI -0.53 to 0.25; <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Strong opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol), examined in six trials (1887 participants), were better than placebo for pain (SMD -0.43, 95%CI -0.52 to -0.33; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>) and function (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.15; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). One trial (1583 participants) demonstrated that tramadol may make little difference compared to celecoxib (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; <I>very low quality evidence</I>) for pain relief. Two trials (272 participants) found no difference between opioids and antidepressants for either pain (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.45; <I>very low quality evidence</I>), or function (SMD -0.11, 95% -0.63 to 0.42; <I>very low quality evidence</I>). The included trials in this review had high drop-out rates, were of short duration, and had limited interpretability of functional improvement. They did not report any serious adverse effects, risks (addiction or overdose), or complications (sleep apnea, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, hypogonadism). In general, the effect sizes were medium for pain and small for function.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-20 12:32:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence (<I>very low to moderate quality</I>) for short-term efficacy (for both pain and function) of opioids to treat CLBP compared to placebo. The very few trials that compared opioids to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antidepressants did not show any differences regarding pain and function. The initiation of a trial of opioids for long-term management should be done with extreme caution, especially after a comprehensive assessment of potential risks. There are no placebo-RCTs supporting the effectiveness and safety of long-term opioid therapy for treatment of CLBP.</P>

<P>Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of pain, disability, social and financial cost throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Volinn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volinn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Approximately 80% of people will experience at least one episode of acute back pain during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Cassidy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassidy 1998</LINK>). Almost one quarter of North Americans are estimated to have experienced an episode of LBP within the previous three months (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 2006</LINK>). Although an early review concluded that 80% to 90% of people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) improve by 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1995</LINK>), a proportion continue to report symptoms over several months and even years. In one study, one-third of people with CLBP continued to be symptomatic after 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1999</LINK>). More recent reviews suggest that the prevalence of LBP is around 23% (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Moreover, a substantial proportion of people with back pain will have recurrences even after the resolution of initial symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 1996</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CLBP and functionality</HEADING>
<P>LBP is the main cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>) and the prevalence of CLBP-related disability is estimated at 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Individuals with CLBP not only experience personal distress, but also present with significant sleep disorders and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2012</LINK>). According to an early study (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1987</LINK>), fewer than 50% of individuals with CLBP who missed work for more than 12 weeks actually returned to work. An absence of two years from employment was associated with almost no chance of returning to work.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic options</HEADING>
<P>The vast majority of CLBP treatments are directed towards symptomatic and functional improvement rather than cure. Patients may be offered a variety of treatment regimens as either monotherapy or a combination of therapies. Treatments may include medications and physical modalities (for example, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), massage therapy, work hardening), rehabilitation, or injection therapy (such as, epidurals, facet joint blocks, and trigger point injections) that are directed specifically at potential anatomic causes for CLBP. A proportion of individuals with CLBP will undergo surgery to alleviate their symptoms. Despite general acceptance of lumbar discectomy, with or without decompression, and lumbar fusion (with or without instrumentation), the actual success rates for symptomatic and functional improvement have been variable, with surgical 'failure' rates estimated between 10% and 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Fritsch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritsch 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, the results are similar with surgery or pharmacological therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Peul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peul 2007</LINK>). These individuals often return to the pool of patients with CLBP, and they often experience poor outcomes regardless of future treatment. Medications play an important role in the management of CLBP and generally fall into four broad categories: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and analgesics including opioids.</P>
<P>Opioids are generally classified as either weak or strong. These terms refer to relative efficacy rather than potency; weak opioids exhibit a ceiling to their analgesic effect, limited principally by increased adverse reactions. The use of opioids remains a controversial issue in the management of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK>), and CLBP in particular (<LINK REF="REF-Turk-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 2011</LINK>). The American College of Physicians &amp; The American Pain Society consensus guidelines for the treatment of LBP recommend opioids for the short-term management of severe and disabling LBP that has had no response with anti-inflammatories or acetaminophen. Notably, this guideline was published in 2007 and includes only a few trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2007</LINK>). In contrast, the American Geriatrics Society Guidelines have suggested that given the problems of NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, opioids should be considered first line treatment for moderate-to-severe pain in older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrell 2009</LINK>). However, recent evidence links the abuse of opioids to negative social consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Bohnert-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohnert 2011</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Controversies with use of opioids</HEADING>
<P>Although many clinicians believe that opioids offer a valuable tool in the management of CNCP, there is still a large group of practitioners who remain hesitant, or even opposed to, the use of these medications. A survey of Canadian physicians exploring attitudes towards opioid use for chronic pain confirmed that 35% of general practitioners and 23% of palliative care physicians would never use opioids for the management of severe CNCP (<LINK REF="REF-Morley_x002d_Foster-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley-Foster 2003</LINK>). A recent study of opioid prescribing stratified across the United States by region and by medical specialty found that 41.5% of respondents prescribed long-term opioids in fewer than 20% of their CNCP patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013</LINK>). Clinicians reluctant to prescribe opioids to treat people with CNCP believe that side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013</LINK>), somnolence resulting in poor function, the risk of abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 2004</LINK>), and general ineffectiveness of opioids may outweigh any potential benefit. Several trials have demonstrated that rather than underlying pathology, characteristics such as age, depression, personality disorder, and substance abuse, distinguished patients with CLBP who were on opioids from those who were receiving non-opioid treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Turk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breckenridge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breckenridge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edlund-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edlund 2007</LINK>). These trials continue to contribute to the confusion and uncertainty regarding the indications and actual benefits of opioids in CLBP. A recent survey among Canadian primary care physicians revealed that the most common fears for opioid prescription were abuse, overdose, and early prescription renewals (<LINK REF="REF-Wenghofer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenghofer 2011</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-21 10:08:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence suggests that opioids are effective for the treatment of CNCP in the short-term (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK>), irrespective of somatic or neuropathic etiology. The diverse mechanisms of action of opioids across the central and peripheral nervous system can be the reason for unpredictable responses to these medications. More importantly, they can lead to the potential development of adverse effects, including development of addictive behaviour.</P>

If data were not available in a format that was appropriate for data extraction, we contacted the authors of the trial for further clarification.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 14:38:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the similarities in populations, methodology, interventions and outcomes, we pooled data from trials comparing opioids to placebo (using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan)</LINK>). We performed meta-analyses (both fixed-effect and random-effects methods) on the outcomes of pain, function, and side effects. If we noted a significant statistical discrepancy between methods, we reported the more conservative result. We reported the results of pain and function from the pooled data as standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We reported side effects using absolute risk differences (RD) with a 95% CI.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and by the updated Cochrane Back Review Group method guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=29261772796236546462100422223404&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Furlan-2009">Furlan 2009</A>). Following GRADE guidelines, we categorized the quality of evidence as follows:</P>
<P> High: further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect.</P>
<P> Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect.</P>
<P> Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
<P> Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P>
<P>We graded the evidence available on specific domains as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Study design</HEADING>
<P>In this review we only included randomized, controlled, double-blinded trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Three authors (LC, AD and AF) independently evaluated the risk of bias of the selected articles, based on criteria described in the Cochrane Back Review Group's updated methods guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). We scored each criterion as "low risk", "high risk", or "unclear". We have presented the description of this evaluation in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. We examined all trials for five types of bias:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, group similarities at baseline)</LI>
<LI>Performance (blinding of participants, blinding of healthcare providers, co-interventions, and compliance with intervention)</LI>
<LI>Attrition (dropouts and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis)</LI>
<LI>Measurement (blinding of the outcome assessors and timing of outcome assessment)</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias (selective reporting)</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the overall risk of bias for each trial in the GRADE synthesis. When all trials were judged as "low risk of bias" for all five categories, we did not downgrade the evidence. We downgraded the evidence by one point when less than three categories were judged "high or unclear". We downgraded the evidence by 2 points when four or more categories were judged "high or unclear".</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Inconsistency</HEADING>
<P>Inconsistency refers to an unexplained heterogeneity of results. Widely differing estimates of the treatment effect (such as, heterogeneity or variability in results) across trials suggest true differences in underlying treatment effect. Inconsistency may arise from differences in: populations (for example, drugs may have larger relative effects in sicker populations), interventions (for example, larger effects with higher drug doses), or outcomes (for example, diminishing treatment effect with time). This item does not apply when there is only one trial. We downgraded the quality of evidence by one point when the heterogeneity or variability in results was large (for example: I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 80%). We downgraded by two points when the heterogeneity or variability in results was large and there was inconsistency arising from populations, interventions, or outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Indirectness</HEADING>
<P>We assessed whether the question being addressed in this systematic review was different from the available evidence regarding the population, intervention, comparator, or an outcome. We downgraded the quality of evidence by one point when there was indirectness in only one area; and by two levels when there was indirectness in two or more areas.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Imprecision</HEADING>
<P>Results are imprecise when trials include relatively few patients and few events and thus have wide CIs around the estimate of the effect.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we considered imprecision for either of the following two reasons:</P>
<P>(1) There was only one trial. When there was more than one trial, the total number of events was &lt; 300 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value) (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>(2) 95% CI around the pooled or best estimate of effect included both (1) no effect and (2) appreciable benefit or appreciable harm. The threshold for "appreciable benefit" or "appreciable harm" is a relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk increase (RRI) &gt; 25%. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one point when there was imprecision due to (1) or (2); or by two levels when there was imprecision due to (1) and (2).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we considered imprecision for either of the following two reasons:</P>
<P>(1) There was only one trial. When there was more than one trial, the total population size was &lt; 400 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value; using the usual &#945; and &#946;, and an effect size of 0.2 SD, representing a small effect).</P>
<P>(2) 95% CI included no effect and the upper or lower CI crosses an effect size (standardized mean difference) of 0.5 in either direction. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one point when there was imprecision due to (1) or (2); or by two points when there was imprecision due to (1) and (2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias is a systematic underestimate or an overestimate of the underlying beneficial or harmful effect due to the selective publication of trials. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one point when the funnel plot suggested publication bias.</P>

<P>The five trials were similar in their reported demographics including age (mean age ranged between 47.1 (<LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2000</LINK>) and 58.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Uberall-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Uberall 2012</LINK>)); sex (female = 64.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Peloso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peloso 2004</LINK>); female = 63.2% (<LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 2003</LINK>); female = 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2000</LINK>); female = 62% (<LINK REF="STD-Uberall-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Uberall 2012</LINK>); female: 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Vorsanger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vorsanger 2008</LINK>)) and ethnicity (all involved a large number of Caucasian participants (&gt; 85% of the randomized population)). Two trials included patients with previous low-back surgery if it was performed more than five years previously, but only if it was associated with complete pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peloso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peloso 2004</LINK>).

Patient history prior to enrolment, including factors such as number of patients actively employed, status of compensation or the average duration of pain before entry into the trial, was not stated.</P>
<P>In two RCTs, tramadol was combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) (<LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peloso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peloso 2004</LINK>).

<P>We included seven RCTs in this category: <LINK REF="STD-Buynak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buynak 2010</LINK> used tapentadol; two RCTs used morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>); two RCTs evaluated oxymorphone (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2007</LINK>); one RCT assessed hydromorphone (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2010</LINK>); and one RCT focused on oxycodone (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK>). Notably, three of the seven included RCTs were not designed with the primary objective of demonstrating the effectiveness of the opioid for the treatment of people with CLBP. <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK> aimed to explore an opioid alternative (oxycodone combined with low-dose naltrexone) to avoid physical dependence after long-term treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> explored the effectiveness of morphine in chronic radicular LBP. <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK> focused on the potential development of opioid tolerance versus opioid-induced hyperalgesia.</P>
<P>In the included trials, the mean age of participants ranged between 45 years (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>) and 53 years (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>).

History of failed back surgery pain or LBP that could have some benefit with spine surgery were also exclusion criteria. All RCTs excluded patients with radicular symptoms or neurological abnormalities in the lower extremities, except for <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>, which focused on patients with sciatica. All RCTs allowed physiotherapy or physical exercise if participants started at least two weeks prior to the trial start. Only <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> described the work or compensation status of the participants.</P>
<P>The mean dose of opioids was 78 mg morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>); 62 mg morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>); 100 to 250 mg tapentadol (40 to 100 morphine equivalent) (<LINK REF="STD-Buynak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buynak 2010</LINK>); 80.9 mg oxymorphone (243morphine equivalent) (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>); 39.2 mg oxymorphone (117.6 morphine equivalent) (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2007</LINK>); 37.8 mg hydromorphone (189 morphine equivalent) (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2010</LINK>), and 39 mg of oxycodone (58.5 morphine equivalent) (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK>). The included trials that evaluated strong opioids for LBP did not allow participants to use concurrent analgesics (including antidepressants and anticonvulsants). All strong opioid trials used pain scores as a primary outcome. Additionally, one trial used quantitative sensory testing (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>). Trial authors measured functional status using SF-36 (<LINK REF="STD-Buynak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buynak 2010</LINK>), RMDQ (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>), ODI (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>); but two oxymorphone trials did not report functional scores (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK> reported two trials with identical methodology (randomized, double-blinded and parallel) that compared the effectiveness of tramadol (50 mg four times a day) versus celecoxib (200 mg twice a day) for treatment of CLBP. 798 participants (mean age 47.5; female 56.4%) received tramadol versus 785 participants (mean age 48; female 58.7%) treated with celecoxib. The rate of participants that completed the six weeks of follow-up was significantly higher in the celecoxib group (86% versus 71.8%). 62% of the participants were Caucasian. This is the only trial that used the rate of participants that had at least 30% improvement in pain ratings from baseline to week 6. The trial authors excluded patients with low back surgery within six months prior to study entry or those taking any kind of analgesic treatment.</P>
<P>Five of the studies that we already described had a second active arm: <LINK REF="STD-Buynak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buynak 2010</LINK> compared tapentadol to sustained-release (SR) oxycodone. <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK> used oxycodone and included two additional arms of a tablet combining oxycodone and naltrexone; we did not use any of the data from the combination arms in the review. <LINK REF="STD-Vorsanger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vorsanger 2008</LINK> analyzed the dose response of tramadol and had two tramadol treatment arms; we included the data using the higher dose. <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> (crossover design) included one period of nortriptyline.

<P>Ten studies described one or more of 14 adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). People treated with opioids had a statistically significant higher incidence of nausea (10%, 95% CI 7% to 14%), dizziness (8%, 95% CI 5% to 11%), constipation (7%, 95% CI 4% to 11%), vomiting (7%, 95% CI 4% to 9%), somnolence (6%, 95% CI 3% to 9%) and dry mouth (6%, 95% CI 2% to 10%) than people treated with placebo. People who received opioids had a &lt; 5% higher incidence of headaches, pruritis, fatigue, anorexia, increased sweating and hot flushes compared to placebo. People treated with either opioids or placebo showed no differences regarding the number of people with upper respiratory tract infection (-2%, 95% CI -8% to 3%) or sinusitis (2%, 95% CI -3% to 6%).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-20 23:29:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 RCTs in this review that assessed the use of opioids for longer than four weeks in the management of CLBP. Overall, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate regarding use of opioids compared to placebo for pain and functional outcomes. The magnitude of the effect sizes were small to medium. All trials suffered from attrition bias with a large number of drop-outs. Many trials employed an enriched enrolment design which is known to under-report adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2011</LINK>). The duration of the included RCTs was longer than four weeks but shorter than 15 weeks. Also, there was poor generalizability to populations at high risk for complications. We identified very few active-controlled (non placebo-controlled) trials. We identified an insufficient number of trials that examined use of tramadol compared to NSAIDS (such as celecoxib) or compared use of opioids with use of antidepressants to treat people with CLBP.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1) Strict inclusion criteria and duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>In the included trials, CLBP was well-defined. However, these trials imposed limitations by excluding patients who presented with pain outside this area (even those with radicular symptoms), had previous unsuccessful lumbar surgery or a history of substance abuse. Given the heterogeneous nature of the CLBP population, narrowly defined criteria prevent extrapolation of results to a more diverse group commonly seen in clinical settings. Importantly, exclusion of failed back surgery syndrome is also significant since it may occur in 10% to 40% of lumbar spine operations and contributes to CLBP (<LINK REF="REF-Oaklander-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oaklander 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review excluded trials of opioid use in CLBP that were shorter than four weeks. Only two trials followed the participants for more than three months (15 weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Buynak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buynak 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2011</LINK>). While these trials lasted substantially longer than most involving opioids and CLBP, we consider these articles to have a 'short-term' time frame. This limited treatment duration, when in reality patients are often treated for years, leaves important unanswered questions including long-term efficacy, safety, tolerance and pain sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 2003</LINK>). Only one study focused on the potential development of opioid tolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2012</LINK>), but the participants were followed for only one month. The high drop-out rate in the included studies demonstrates the huge challenge of developing double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies for long-term follow-up. We recommend that future studies should compare opioids to other analgesics with the goal of obtaining long-term data on relative effectiveness and safety. These studies should also enroll patients commonly presenting with CLBP, including those with prior spine surgery and at variable risk for opioid misuse or abuse (for example, explicitly identifying risk using valid questionnaires).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2) Poorly-defined study population</HEADING>
<P>In the included RCTs that compared opioids with placebo, the study authors did not report sufficient information regarding the history of study populations. Although study authors documented demographic data well, many studies neglected to report other parameters affecting outcomes, such as duration of pain prior to enrolment, employment or compensation status or poor response to previous treatment, including opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1999</LINK>). Thus we were unable to compare intervention and placebo arms based on potentially relevant factors other than age, sex and race. Finally, all studies permitted physiotherapy under certain circumstances, but none of the trials reported the number of patients who may have received concurrent treatment or the types of therapy these patients obtained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3) Limited interpretation of functional improvement</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies used validated questionnaires to assess functional outcomes. As noted by our results, the pooled SMD favoured in a moderate grade the use of tramadol or strong opioids for improvement of the functional outcomes. Further information is required for any recommendation for transdermal buprenorphine.</P>
<P>An additional limitation regarding functional outcomes is the difficulty associated with the interpretation of these data in meaningful economic or social activities, such as return-to-work or improvement in ADLs. This issue is not specific to these trials, but highlights a problem present in the pain literature when attempting to interpret improvement registered in research-based tools alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">4) High drop-out rates and ITT analysis</HEADING>
<P>Most studies had significant drop-out rates (&gt; 20%). Although the reasons were clearly documented, the implications on final outcomes could be significant. Experimental mortality (loss of patients during the trial) with greater loss in the control arm could enhance the effect seen in favour of treatment. In addition, substantial drop-outs reduce the power of the study, compromising the ability to detect a significant difference. Overall, interpretation of the study outcomes with any level of confidence is questionable, given the significant number of drop-outs.</P>
<P>Several studies stated that efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population. However, some of them failed to perform a proper ITT. The method of handling absent data for patients lost to follow-up was documented through the use of LOCF. This method has been criticized given the potential overestimation of the effect (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">5) Comparison to other reviews on opioids in CNCP and CLBP</HEADING>
<P>Two recently published systematic reviews have addressed the issue of opioids in the pharmacological management of CNCP (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2011</LINK>) and CLBP (<LINK REF="REF-Kuijpers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuijpers 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2011</LINK> concluded that opioids were more effective than placebo for improving both pain and function in the management of CNCP. The results were significant for both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Subgroup analyses revealed that only strong opioids (oxycodone and morphine) were statistically more effective in reducing pain but not function when compared to naproxen and nortriptyline. <LINK REF="REF-Kuijpers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuijpers 2011</LINK> evaluated opioids, antidepressants and NSAIDs for CLBP; however, they excluded patients with sciatica. Several studies that we included in our review were not considered in <LINK REF="REF-Kuijpers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuijpers 2011</LINK> due to timing of publication. Their conclusion regarding the effectiveness of opioids does not differ from our conclusion.</P>
<P>Our review confirms the effectiveness of tramadol, buprenorphine and strong opioids in the management of CLBP in the short-term. Other systematic reviews on opioids in people with CNCP have included people with multiple pathologies. This factor and the predominance of short-term studies could limit any meaningful interpretation when considering opioids for the long-term management of CLBP.</P>
<P>The results of our review differ from another published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK>). The review (<LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK>) included 15 studies in the literature assessing the efficacy of opioids in CLBP. Nine of the studies considered comparisons among different opioids, while another six compared opioids with placebo or other analgesics. Meta-analysis of this latter group was completed with four of the six studies. The review authors found that opioids were ineffective in the management of CLBP when compared to the pooled sample of placebo and other analgesics.</P>
<P>The existence of discordant reviews has been previously described in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2001</LINK>). The only common clinical query between our review and that of <LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK> related to the efficacy of opioids in CLBP. Notably, the two reviews used different outcomes to define the efficacy of opioids. Our review considered pain and function as outcome measures. Also, there were differences between inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our review restricted original articles to opioid treatment that was longer than one month in duration to provide more meaningful clinical interpretation in the management of CLBP. We excluded comparisons among opioids to avoid issues with head-to-head trials or equivalency determinations. We also considered only articles published in peer-review journals. Taking these criteria into account, we excluded nine trials (all opioid comparators) found in <LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK> from our review. From the six trials comparing the efficacy of opioids to placebo or another analgesic, we excluded five from our review for the following reasons: two trials were published in abstract form (Tennant 1993; Richards 2002), two trials had a treatment duration of less than 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Kuntz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuntz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muller-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Muller 1998</LINK>) and one trial had a lack of randomization when comparing opioids to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Hale-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2005</LINK>; <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The three trials (all involving tramadol) we used to derive our meta-analyses were absent from the <LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK> review. Although not specifically stated in their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the review authors may have excluded tramadol as an opioid, given its atypical status. Finally, <LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK> combined studies involving placebo and other comparators to determine efficacy. In this case, conceptual homogeneity may not have existed due to differences in patient response to an active control compared with placebo. Statistical pooling of these studies may lead to questionable results.</P>
<P>Many people experience recurring episodes of LBP or never fully recover from their initial episode (<LINK REF="REF-Abenhaim-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abenhaim 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 1996</LINK>). With direct and indirect costs estimated to exceed $100 billion annually in the United States alone, LBP continues to inflict a huge economic toll on society (<LINK REF="REF-Hashemi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hashemi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2006</LINK>). Opioids have become a popular tool to help manage patients with CLBP. The prevalence of opioid prescribing in CLBP varies by treatment setting but has been found to be as low as 3% or as high as 66% (<LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK>). Moreover, the same review (<LINK REF="REF-Martell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2007</LINK>) identified prescription of opioids to be more common to patients with impaired functional status. Despite significant concerns surrounding the use of opioids, there is still little evidence in the literature for their efficacy and effectiveness in long-term treatment of CLBP. Although few systematic reviews suggest that opioids are effective in the management of CNCP in general, the extrapolation of this evidence to CLBP is cautioned. Further, the few original studies that do exist focusing on opioids for the management of CLBP are of limited value in clinical practice given their lack of long-term follow-up and description of long-term safety profile. As the pendulum has swung from an 'opiophobic' to an 'opiophilic' society, physicians should question whether the current trend is based on evidence or simply the outcries of well-intentioned patient advocates and aggressive marketing efforts by the pharmaceutical industry (<LINK REF="REF-Chinellato-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinellato 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is evidence (multiple high quality RCTs) that the use of tramadol (a weak atypical opioid) or strong opioids results in improved pain and moderate changes in function in the short-term in people with CLBP when compared with placebo. However, the general applicability of this treatment to the clinical setting is questionable. Several factors, including the strict inclusion criteria of the original studies, high drop-out rates, and the poor description of the study population regarding duration of pain, concurrent treatments, work status, and compensation, limit the reported results. Notably, a number of important outcomes that capture patient function were absent (such as return-to-work). Finally, there is strong evidence that nausea is more common in patients with CLBP being treated with opioids when compared to placebo.</P>

<P>CLBP is a prevalent condition with significant socioeconomic implications in the Western world. Given the escalating use of opioids in CNCP (a subset of which is CLBP) more quality research is needed to understand i) the long term benefits and risks of opioid therapy including the different subgroups of CLBP (for example, failed back surgery syndrome and CLBP with radicular symptoms); ii) opioid effectiveness relative to other conventional physical and medical treatments; iii) characteristics of patients who are most likely to respond to long-term opioid therapy; and iv) the predictors of opioid side effects, abuse and misuse in this population.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomized sequence</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots or minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random).</P>
<P>There is a high risk of selection bia<I>s</I> if the investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process such as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by judgement of the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment (selection bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (for example, a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (for example, if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of participants</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants during the study</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of performance bias if blinding of participants was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>

<UL>
<LI>for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient was the outcome assessor (for example, pain, disability): there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (for example, co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>)</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if drop-outs are very large, imputation using even "acceptable" methods may still suggest a high risk of bias) (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). The percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias (these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by literature) (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting (reporting bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</P>
<P>There is a high risk of reporting bias<I> </I>if<I> </I>not all of the study's pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (for example, subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Group similarity at baseline<SUP> </SUP>(selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Bias due to dissimilarity at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators.</P>
<P>There is low risk of bia<I>s</I> if groups are similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s), and important prognostic factors (examples in the field of back and neck pain are duration and severity of complaints, vocational status, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms) (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Co-interventions<SUP> </SUP>(performance bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bias because co-interventions were different across groups</HEADING>
<P>There is low risk of bias if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Compliance<SUP> </SUP>(performance bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups</HEADING>
<P>There is low risk of bias if compliance with the interventions was acceptable, based on the reported intensity/dosage, duration, number and frequency for both the index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (for example surgery), this item is irrelevant (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ITT analysis</HEADING>
<P>There is low risk of bias if all randomized patients were reported or analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bias because important outcomes were not measured at the same time across groups</HEADING>
