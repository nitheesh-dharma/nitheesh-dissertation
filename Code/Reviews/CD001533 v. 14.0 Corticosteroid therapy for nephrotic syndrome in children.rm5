<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:23:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. When it is untreated, children can often die from infections. Most children, with nephrotic syndrome, respond to corticosteroid drugs (prednisone, prednisolone) reducing the risk of serious infection. However they usually have repeat episodes, which are often triggered by viral infections. Corticosteroid drugs can have serious side effects.</P>
<P>We looked at evidence from 34 studies enrolling 3033 children. Fourteen of 21 studies, in children with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome, evaluated prednisone for two or three months compared with longer durations. Thirteen studies evaluated different corticosteroid regimens in children with frequently relapsing disease (FRNS). Studies were of variable methodological quality with only about half of the studies at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>Among studies of long versus shorter duration of prednisone, older studies at high or unclear risk of bias tended to over-estimate the effect of longer course therapy compared with new studies at low risk of bias. Studies at low risk of bias found no significant differences in the risk of relapse or the development of FRNS between prednisone given for three to six months compared with two or three months. Therefore there is no benefit of increasing the duration of prednisone beyond two or three months in the initial episode of SSNS.</P>
<P>Based on four studies in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, prednisone given for five to seven days at the onset of a viral infection reduces the risk of relapse.</P>
<P>This review updates information previously published in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2007. The addition of three new studies evaluating different durations of prednisone in the first episode of nephrotic syndrome has changed the conclusions expressed in previous versions of this review</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:18:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In nephrotic syndrome protein leaks from the blood to the urine through the glomeruli resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the mortality rate to around 3%. However corticosteroids have well recognised potentially serious adverse effects such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2003, 2005 and 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:46:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS, and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:46:57 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 26 February 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:54:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (three months to 18 years) in their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-17 15:05:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:22:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Ten new studies were identified so a total of 34 studies (3033 total participants) were included in the 2015 review update. The risk of bias attributes were frequently poorly performed. Low risk of bias was reported in 18 studies for sequence generation, 16 studies for allocation concealment, seven for performance and detection bias, 15 for incomplete reporting and 16 for selective reporting. Three months or more of prednisone significantly reduced the risk of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) (6 studies, 582 children: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00) and of relapse by 12 to 24 months (8 studies, 741 children: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) compared with two months. Five or six months of prednisone significantly reduced the risk of relapse (7 studies, 763 children: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85) but not FRNS (5 studies, 591 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.22) compared with three months. However there was significant heterogeneity in the analyses. Subgroup analysis stratified by risk of bias for allocation concealment showed that the risk for FRNS did not differ significantly between two or three months of prednisone and three to six months among studies at low risk of bias but was significantly reduced in extended duration studies compared with two or three months in studies at high risk or unclear risk of bias. There were no significant differences in the risk of adverse effects between extended duration and two or three months of prednisone. Four studies found that in children with FRNS, daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment significantly reduced the rate of relapse.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-17 15:57:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In this 2015 update the addition of three well-designed studies has changed the conclusion of this review. Studies of long versus shorter duration of corticosteroids have heterogeneous treatment effects, with the older high risk of bias studies tending to over-estimate the effect of longer course therapy, compared with more recently published low risk of bias studies. Among studies at low risk of bias, there was no significant difference in the risk for FRNS between prednisone given for two or three months and longer durations or total dose of therapy indicating that there is no benefit of increasing the duration of prednisone beyond two or three months in the initial episode of SSNS.</P>
<P>The risk of relapse in children with FRNS is reduced by the administration of daily prednisone at onset of an upper respiratory tract or viral infection. Three additional studies have increased the evidence supporting this conclusion. This management strategy may be considered for children with FRNS. A paucity of data on prednisone use in relapsing nephrotic syndrome remains. In particular there are no data from RCTs evaluating the efficacy and safety of prolonged courses of low dose alternate-day prednisone although this management strategy is recommended in current guidelines.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:23:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a well-recognised chronic illness in childhood. The characteristic features, including oedema, proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia, result from alterations of the perm-selectivity barrier of the glomerular capillary wall. The reported incidence is 2 to 7/100,000 children, with a prevalence of 16/100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 2003</LINK>). Recent prospective studies revealed an incidence of 1.15 to 2.1/100,000 children/year (<LINK REF="REF-El-Bakkali-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Bakkali 2011</LINK>).The incidence of nephrotic syndrome is higher in Asian (<LINK REF="REF-McKinney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinney 2001</LINK>), African-American (<LINK REF="REF-Srivastava-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srivastava 1999</LINK>) and Arab children (<LINK REF="REF-Elzouki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elzouki 1984</LINK>). Most children have minimal change disease, in which changes on light microscopy are minor or absent, and respond to corticosteroid agents. Despite the overall incidence of childhood nephrotic syndrome remaining relatively stable over the last three decades, the histological pattern appears to be changing with an increase in the incidence of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), even after adjustment for biopsy practices (<LINK REF="REF-Bonilla_x002d_Felix-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonilla-Felix 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulati 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Srivastava-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srivastava 1999</LINK>). The histological variant and response to immunosuppressive treatment may be related to ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 2003</LINK>). Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) is less common in African and African-American children, and in South Africa 7.2% of 236 African children had SSNS compared with 62% of 286 Indian children (<LINK REF="REF-Bhimma-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhimma 1997</LINK>). The pathogenesis of SSNS remains unknown but appears to be related to abnormalities in T-cell and B-cell regulation. About 80% of children who respond to corticosteroids experience a relapsing course with recurrent episodes of oedema and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarshish-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarshish 1997</LINK>). The complications of nephrotic syndrome are related to effects of the disease itself, and adverse effects related to corticosteroid therapy and corticosteroid sparing agents. Children with nephrotic syndrome, which is resistant to therapy, are at increased risk of bacterial infection, characteristically resulting in peritonitis, cellulitis or septicaemia, of thromboembolic phenomena and of protein calorie malnutrition. Before antibiotics became available, two thirds of children with nephrotic syndrome died (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1971</LINK>).The survivors remitted spontaneously after several months. Mortality rates fell to 35% with the introduction of sulphonamides and penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1971</LINK>) and fell further with the use of corticosteroid medications.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 16:04:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Corticosteroids have been used to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome since 1950 when large doses of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisone given for two to three weeks were found to induce diuresis with loss of oedema and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1971</LINK>). Corticosteroid usage has reduced the mortality rate in childhood nephrotic syndrome to around 3%, with infection remaining the most important cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-ISKDC-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISKDC 1984</LINK>). Of children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome, approximately 80% will achieve remission with corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>). Because of this dramatic before-after evidence, oral corticosteroids are the first-line treatment of a child presenting with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and no randomised controlled prospective studies of corticosteroids compared to placebo were carried out. The achievement of remission with corticosteroid therapy determines long term prognosis for kidney function irrespective of kidney histology (<LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 2009</LINK>). However corticosteroids have known adverse effects. Major complications related to prolonged corticosteroid use in nephrotic syndrome include growth impairment, particularly with steroid therapy administered daily (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 1988</LINK>), cataracts (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2001</LINK>) and excessive weight gain or obesity (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00fc_th-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rüth 2005</LINK>).Two recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mishra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2010</LINK>) highlight the impact of psychological and behavioural abnormalities related to corticosteroid therapy. Anxiety, depression, emotional lability, aggressive behaviour and attention problems had already developed with completion of 12 weeks of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mishra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishra 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2010</LINK> demonstrated family background, particularly maternal distress, reduced quality of life and psychosocial adjustment. Adverse effects are particularly prevalent in those children who relapse frequently and thus require multiple courses of corticosteroids.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:57:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of corticosteroids in SSNS are not fully understood (<LINK REF="REF-Mehls-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehls 2011</LINK>). It is widely believed the main effect is through the regulation of nuclear gene expression via the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor, which activates genes for anti-inflammatory cytokines and suppresses genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines. Glucocorticoids are lipid soluble and can easily pass through cell membranes. This process takes several hours. More recently research had identified corticosteroid effects, which are independent of nuclear gene transcription and occur earlier. At high glucocorticoid doses, suppression of T-cell function occurs. Corticosteroids also act directly to stabilise the podocyte cytoskeleton.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:00:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The original treatment schedules for childhood nephrotic syndrome were developed in an ad hoc manner. The International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) was established in 1966 and determined by consensus a regimen of daily corticosteroids for four weeks followed by corticosteroids given on three consecutive days out of seven for four weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1971</LINK>). Since then many physicians have used regimens involving periods of daily followed by alternate-day or intermittent therapy and several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated different durations and total corticosteroid therapy doses in an effort to delineate the optimal doses and durations of corticosteroid therapy that are most beneficial and least harmful. These have been evaluated in previous versions of this systematic review. However despite these data there remains no consensus on the most appropriate corticosteroid regimen to achieve and maintain remission with the least adverse effects. Therefore the 2015 update of this review has been undertaken to identify further RCTs, which compare different corticosteroid regimens in the initial episode of SSNS and in relapsing disease.</P>

<P>The initial review was undertaken by four authors. The titles and abstracts were screened by two authors who discarded studies that were not relevant (i.e. studies of lipid lowering agents) although studies and reviews that could have included relevant data or information on studies were retained initially. Three authors independently assessed abstracts, and if necessary the full text, to determine which studies satisfied the characteristics required for inclusion. The 2003, 2005 and 2007 updates were undertaken by three authors (EH, NW, JC).</P>
<P>This 2015 update was undertaken by four authors (DH, EH, NW, JC). Potentially relevant studies were initially determined by two authors from titles and abstracts. Full text articles of potentially eligible articles were reviewed for eligibility by two authors.</P>

<P>Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed by two authors using standardised data extraction forms. Studies in languages other than English were translated before data extraction. Where more than one report of a study was identified, data were extracted from all reports.

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (relapse or no relapse, side effects) the risk ratio (RR) for individual studies were calculated and summary statistics estimated using the random effects model and results compared to those obtained using a fixed effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (cumulative steroid therapy, relapse rate), these data were analysed as the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. The time to relapse was not included since many children did not experience relapse so the data would be biased.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-17 16:05:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We added 10 studies to this 2015 update to bring the total number of included studies to 34 enrolling 3033 children. Analysis of data from three studies has led to the new conclusion that in studies at low risk of bias, there is no significant difference in the risk for FRNS between two and three months of prednisone and more than three months of prednisone in the initial episode of SSNS. Data from three other studies increased the evidence base to support administering prednisone or increasing the dose during URTI to reduce the risk of relapse in children with FRNS.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prednisone in the first episode of SSNS</HEADING>
<P>Our initial review in 2000 demonstrated that prednisone administered for three months or more significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 12 to 24 months and of FRNS compared with two months in the initial episode of SSNS. Increasing the duration of prednisone up to seven months increased the benefit obtained. It was unclear whether the increase in benefit was related to increased duration or increased dose though indirect analyses suggested that duration was more important than dose. However it was also noted that some included studies in the analyses were at unclear or high risk of bias. In the 2003 and 2005 updates, additional studies were identified which reported that six months of prednisone significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with three months. In clinical practice, paediatric nephrologists tended to use increasing durations of prednisone in the initial episode of nephrotic syndrome though considerable variation existed between physicians reflecting in part the poor quality of the evidence from randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-MacHardy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacHardy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>This 2015 update included three large, well designed studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teeninga-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Teeninga 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoshikawa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshikawa 2014</LINK>) comparing different durations of prednisone. In <LINK REF="STD-Teeninga-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Teeninga 2013</LINK> children received the same total dose of prednisone administered over three or six months, however children included in <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yoshikawa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshikawa 2014</LINK> received a higher total dose of prednisone in the six months treatment group compared with the shorter treatment group. Inclusion of these studies in meta-analyses showed that the risk of relapse by 12 to 24 months and of FRNS continued to favour extended duration of prednisone except for the analysis of FRNS in the comparison of five to six months with three months of prednisone. However there was considerable heterogeneity between studies with I<SUP>2</SUP> results varying between 36% and 83%. Subgroup analysis stratified for the risk of bias domains showed that studies at low risk of bias for allocation concealment, attrition bias and performance/detection bias found no significant differences in the risk of relapse by 12 to 24 months or FRNS between two to three months of prednisone and three to seven months. Studies at high risk of bias on the other hand showed significant benefits of increasing treatment duration. Therefore studies of long versus shorter duration corticosteroids have heterogeneous treatment effects, with the older high risk of bias studies tending to over-estimate the effect of longer course therapy, compared with more recently published low risk of bias studies. Among studies at low risk of bias, there was no significant difference in the risk for FRNS between prednisone given for two to three months and longer durations or total dose of therapy indicating that there is no benefit of increasing the duration of prednisone beyond two to three months in the initial episode of SSNS. A study comparing two months with four months of prednisone is currently underway in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-PREDNOS-Study-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PREDNOS Study 2013</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prednisone in relapsing SSNS</HEADING>
<P>Daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone therapy reduced the rate of relapse. Three additional larger studies of improved methodological quality have increased the power of this analysis so that this management may be considered for children with frequently relapsing SSNS, who are already receiving alternate-day prednisone. Preliminary data from a fourth study suggests that daily prednisone during URTI reduces the risk of relapse in children not receiving prednisone. A further study addressing this question is currently underway in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-PREDNOS-2-Study-2014" TYPE="STUDY">PREDNOS 2 Study 2014</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:29:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>This review includes studies evaluating corticosteroid therapy and nephrotic syndrome, with the majority of studies focusing on therapy for the initial presentation of nephrotic syndrome. Three additional well designed studies involving 562 children has led to the change in conclusions for this review so that the optimum duration of prednisone is suggested to be two or three months of prednisone in the initial episode of SSNS rather than longer durations as argued in previous versions of this review.</P>
<P>There remain few data on the treatment of relapsing nephrotic syndrome with prednisone. In particular there are no studies addressing the use of long term alternate-day corticosteroid therapy to maintain remission in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome although this management is widely recommended in guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of medications were either not reported or there was limited reporting in studies. Among 16 studies evaluating increased duration or dose in the initial episode of SSNS, hypertension, ophthalmological disorders and Cushing's syndrome were reported in 12, 11 and eight studies respectively. Prednisone therapy is known to be associated with significant behavioural and psychological adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Mishra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2010</LINK>). However only seven of these studies reported this outcome and no studies reported data on quality of life for the child or their family. Adverse effects of medications were reported in more detail in the three well designed studies published in 2013 and 2014 (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teeninga-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Teeninga 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoshikawa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshikawa 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies included the major ethnic groups, but there are few separable data for African-American or African children. These groups of children, who are known to have a higher incidence of initial and late steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2011</LINK>), may show different responses in studies of increased dose or duration of prednisone.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-17 16:06:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Of the 34 studies included, only 18 (53%) and 16 studies (47%) revealed adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment respectively. In part this may be due to suboptimal reporting of these parameters in earlier studies. However some studies published recently failed to provide adequate information on these parameters. Blinding of participants, investigators and outcome assessors was only reported in seven (21%) studies. Studies without blinding were considered at high risk of bias because knowledge of treatment groups could influence both patient management and reporting of remission and relapse by urinalyses. Both attrition bias (incomplete reporting of outcome data) and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting) were at low risk of bias in fewer than 50% of studies. Studies with inadequate allocation concealment can exaggerate the efficacy of the experimental treatment by 30% to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and meta-analyses of low quality studies may overestimate the benefit of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Addition of recently published well designed studies resulted in significant heterogeneity in the primary efficacy outcomes (relapse, FRNS) in studies assessing the duration of prednisone for the initial episode of SSNS. Subgroup analyses of these studies demonstrated that older studies at higher risk of bias overestimated the benefit of increased duration of prednisone while newer studies at low risk of bias found no significant benefit of prolonging prednisone beyond two to three months in the initial episode of nephrotic syndrome resulting in changed conclusions for this review.</P>
<P>In summary of finding tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) for comparisons of two months with three months or more, and of three months with five or six months in the first episode of SSNS, the overall quality of studies was considered low for efficacy outcomes because of a high risk of bias in some studies and heterogeneity between studies. When studies with the outcome of FRNS were separated into subgroups according to risk of bias for allocation concealment, the quality of the evidence was considered high for studies at low risk of allocation concealment and moderate for studies at high or uncertain risk of bias of allocation concealment. The quality of studies for the adverse effects was considered moderate or low because of inclusion of some poor quality studies and few included studies.</P>
<P>Only 15/34 studies were included in the summary of findings tables and all compared treatment regimens in the first episode of nephrotic syndrome. The remaining studies were single studies or data could not be included in the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>A detailed search using the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register was completed in February 2015. The Renal Register contains conference abstracts as well as published studies and there is no language restriction. This minimised the risk that eligible studies were omitted, although more recently published eligible studies and eligible studies in some congress proceedings not searched could have been missed. There were 10 (29%) included studies that were only available in abstract form with limited information on study methods and outcomes. Failure to include these studies could result in overestimation of treatment effect since it is known that negative studies are less likely to be published or may be published later than positive studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2007</LINK>). Alternately, some authors have argued that inclusion of these studies could result in overestimation of treatment effect through selective outcome reporting and incomplete reporting of the number of patients completing follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many studies were small and had incomplete information on study methods and results and further results particularly of older studies could not be obtained despite contacting authors. Of the 34 included studies 19 were published in 2000 or earlier - before the CONSORT checklist first published in 1996 would be likely to influence study methodology and reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>This was an extensive review; each step was completed independently by at least two authors thus minimising risks of errors in determining study eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias assessment and data synthesis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:01:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Prolongation of prednisolone therapy beyond two to three months in the initial episode of SSNS does not reduce the risk of relapse in studies at low risk of bias whether the same total dose of prednisone is used for short and long durations or whether the total dose of prednisone is increased with longer durations of treatment. The results of a further well designed study evaluating different durations and therefore total doses of prednisone are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-PREDNOS-Study-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PREDNOS Study 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Daily prednisone therapy during an upper respiratory infection or other infection reduces the risk of relapse compared with continuing alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone.</P>
<P>During daily therapy, prednisone is as effective when administered as a single daily dose compared with divided doses.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-11 15:30:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We now know that administering prednisone over six months rather than two or three months does not reduce the risk of relapse or of developing frequently relapsing disease. However all studies evaluating the duration of prednisolone have used similar daily and alternate daily doses of prednisolone based on the empirical regimens established by ISDKC and Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Pädiatrische Nephrologie in the 1970s and 1980s so we still do not know whether the same results could be obtained with lower total doses of prednisolone.</P>
<P>Adverse events including hypertension, ophthalmological disorders and behavioural or psychological effects are poorly reported. Recently published studies have provided additional information on adverse effects. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-PREDNOS-Study-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PREDNOS Study 2013</LINK> comparing eight weeks with 16 weeks of prednisone will include a detailed assessment of the behavioural effects of prednisone.</P>
<P>Further RCTs are required to evaluate different durations of alternate-day prednisone regimens in children with frequently relapsing SSNS as prolonged alternate-day prednisone is recommended in current guidelines although there are no RCT data to support this recommendation.</P>
<P>Four RCTs from emerging countries have shown that daily prednisone administered during an intercurrent infection reduces the risk of relapse. A further well designed RCT is currently assessing this intervention in European children, where the pattern of intercurrent infections may be different (<LINK REF="STD-PREDNOS-2-Study-2014" TYPE="STUDY">PREDNOS 2 Study 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some evidence that children with SSNS suffer post-prednisone adrenal insufficiency and that this state may predispose to relapse. The efficacy of cortisol substitution in such children should be examined in a further RCT.</P>
<P>Further studies of deflazacort in comparison with prednisone with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up periods are required in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome to confirm its efficacy. Studies including the use of ACTH in comparison with prednisone may also be of benefit.</P>
