<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-01 21:29:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The successful end-point of IVF treatment is for a woman to give birth to a live infant. This outcome is based on various factors including adequate number of retrieved eggs, which are obtained using various treatment protocols. Failure to recruit adequate follicles, from which the eggs are retrieved, is called a 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols targeted at these women have been proposed, aiming to increase their ovarian response. This review of ten randomised controlled trials suggests there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any one particular intervention in the management of women who are poor responders. More research is needed with good quality trials looking at relevant outcomes such as live birth rates rather than treatment-associated outcomes such as positive pregnancy rates or number of eggs. Research is also recommended in adverse outcomes and costs of these treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-02 12:35:29 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-12-02 13:43:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>At birth of a girl both ovaries contain approximately one to two million primordial follicles, of which only about 300,000 are available for ovulation at puberty. Thereafter there is a steady follicular loss, at a rate of about 1000 per month, and this accelerates beyond 35 years of age. Under normal conditions, in a lifetime only 400 to 500 follicles reach the mature pre-ovulatory stage to form a dominant follicle. It is this dominant follicle that releases the mature egg in every ovulatory cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Faddy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faddy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palter 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although all follicles have equal potential to reach full maturation, only follicles at a more advanced stage of development during the rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) will gain gonadotrophin (GT) dependence. The FSH concentration above which the follicles develop GT dependence is called the FSH threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1978</LINK>). During exogenous administration of FSH the ovary responds normally only if the FSH levels rise above this threshold. In addition to the FSH dose there are many other factors that affect the response by the ovary: a woman's age; weight; antral follicle count; serum factors such as inhibin B, anti-Mullerian hormone and growth factors; or the presence of other endocrinological conditions such as hyperprolactinaemia (high levels of circulating prolactin hormone), polycystic ovarian syndrome and adrenal hyperandrogaenemia (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-06-29 00:35:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are various proposed treatment protocols targeted at this particular cohort of women, who are having IVF treatment after a poor response in a previous treatment cycle, which aim at increasing ovarian response to COH. These protocols can be grouped as follows:<BR/>(1) pituitary down regulation (use of GnRH agonist or antagonist protocols);<BR/>(2) modifying COH (use of GT, clomiphene);<BR/>(3) adjuvant therapy such use of oral contraceptive pill (OCP), steroids, progestins, L-arginine.</P>
<P>The success of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment depends on adequate follicle recruitment. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is gonadotrophin (GT) induced stimulation of the ovaries for purposes of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, which specifically aims at inducing ongoing multiple follicle development rather than a single dominant follicle in ovulatory women (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 1997</LINK>). Protocols for COH are based on this principle. The FSH threshold varies in individual women and has no known reliable predictive factors (<LINK REF="REF-Bancsi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancsi 2002</LINK>). Hence, ovarian response to COH may differ leading to an optimal response or a sub-optimal response, which may be 'poor response' or 'ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome'. If a woman is suspected to be a likely poor responder the dose of GT administered is commonly increased.</P>
<P>
<I>Definition of poor response </I>
<BR/>The definition of poor response to COH in IVF treatment varies widely (<LINK REF="REF-Surrey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surrey 2000</LINK>) based on one or a combination of some of the following factors: variable numbers of mature follicles observed on ultrasound (ranging from less than two to less than five), maximal oestradiol levels during COH (range 100 to 660 pg/mL), number of mature oocytes retrieved (less than three to less than six), minimal cumulative dose or days of GT stimulation required in a prior cycle; in combination with factors known to be associated with poor response, such as age (more than 40 years), early follicular phase FSH levels (range 6.5 to 15 mIU/mL) and failed GnRHa stimulation test.<BR/>All fertility units providing IVF treatment perform ultrasound follicular scanning for women having COH. Hence, the definition using the number of follicles would appear most acceptable.The incidence of poor response to assisted reproductive techniques (ART) is estimated to be 9 to 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fasouliotis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasouliotis 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-02 12:35:29 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>All interventions are aimed at increasing ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during IVF or ICSI treatment</P>
<P>(A) Pituitary down regulation (use of GnRH agonist or antagonist protocols);</P>
<P>A major reason for the variable response to gonadotrophin therapy is interference due to the actions of endogenous gonadotrophins (premature LH surge). The strategy behind using GnRH agonist/antagonist is to suppress pituitary gonadotrophin secretion and then to stimulate the follicular growth with gonadotrophins, thus facilitating cycle control. A long protocol of Gonadotrophin- releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to prevent premature LH surges has been the standard treatment for ovarian stimulation in assisted reproduction. In the long protocols (with GnRHa started either in the mid-luteal phase or in the early follicular phase of the preceding cycle) gonadotrophin administration is delayed until pituitary desensitisation has been achieved, which usually takes two to three weeks. The antagonists have an immediate suppressive effect on the pituitary in contrast to the agonists that have an initial "flare-up" effect on FSH and LH secretion before suppression occurs.<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>(B) Modifying COH (use of GT, clomiphene);</P>
<P>The techniques of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in assisted reproduction are based on a preliminary phase of ovarian induction to produce multiple follicles and the collection of the eggs for fertilisation in-vitro. There are several types of gonadotrophins available for this purpose. The first generation of gonadotrophins, used in the 1970's, was human menopausal gonadotrophin, produced from the urine of menopausal women (hMG, a combination of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in a 1:1 ratio). Since the 1980's, a variety of urinary gonadotrophins have been produced, such as purified FSH (FSH-P) which contains less than one international unit (IU) of LH per 75 IU of FSH. The third generation of urinary gonadotrophins was highly purified FSH (FSH-HP) with less than 0.1 IU of LH per 75 IU of FSH. The fourth generation of gonadotrophins is produced using recombinant DNA technology (recombinant FSH, rFSH) and is highly pure (99.9%) and free from LH activity which is now commonly used.</P>
<P>Clomiphene (or clomiphene) is an anti-oestrogen and competes for receptor binding sites with endogenous oestrogens. By blocking receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, clomiphene interferes with the feedback mechanism of endogenous oestrogen on the pituitary and hypothalamus and an increase in FSH and LH secretion by the pituitary results. The clomiphene-induced elevation of gonadotrophins stimulates the production of ovarian follicles (folliculogenesis) and ovulation. CC is usually administered daily at a dosage of 50 to 150 mg orally for a maximum of five days beginning during the early follicular phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) injections are used to trigger ovulation (by simulating an LH surge) when there are developed follicles.</P>
<P>(C) Adjuvant therapy such use of oral contraceptive pill (OCP), steroids, progestins, L-arginine.</P>
<P>Various adjuvant treatments are being used during ovarian stimulation for IVF in order to improve pregnancy rates. Adjuvant use of COCP (<LINK REF="REF-Smulders-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smulders 2006</LINK>) and steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandian-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandian 2009</LINK>) are already addressed in separate Cochrane reviews and will not be included in this review .</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-02 12:22:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>
<I>Clinical significance of the problem</I>
<BR/>Women who respond poorly to ovulation induction in the context of ART (poor responders) present a challenging and frustrating problem. Despite the differences in definition, poor responders often have their treatment cycle cancelled because of presumed poor outcome in terms of clinical pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lashen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lashen 1999</LINK>). This can cause emotional distress for the couple as well as increase the financial burden on the service provider, couple or both. The cost of treatment may vary depending on the different interventions used for pituitary down regulation and the drugs used for COH in subsequent cycles for women who have had a poor response in a previous treatment cycle. Often, in women with recurrent poor response, use of donated eggs is the only option. This has far reaching consequences on the couple who have to undergo extensive counselling and then await a suitable donor.</P>
<P>There is little understanding about the best protocol to be used in the management of the individual poor responder. This review will attempt to provide clinicians with clearer data about the effectiveness and safety of any existing protocols for COH of poor responders in IVF and also identify areas in which further evaluation is necessary.<BR/>

<P>Study participants that were considered to be 'poor responders' to COH in IVF treatment, in all age groups. For this review we have defined a poor responder as a woman having COH for IVF who fails to produce an adequate number of mature ovarian follicles (generally less than three follicles measuring more than or equal to 17 mm in diameter) as a consequence of which a sub optimal number of oocytes (less than three oocytes) are retrieved. Since the definition varies widely, studies where the authors clearly defined a poor response to COH in a previous treatment cycle (long protocol only since this is the standard protocol currently used) were accepted. Where this was unclear, we wrote to the authors for further clarification. Any studies without a clearly identifiable definition, despite correspondence, were excluded from the review.</P>

<P>The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) to assess: sequence generation;</P>
<P>allocation concealment; blinding of participants, providers and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and</P>
<P>other potential sources of bias. Two authors (ZP, SB) assessed these six domains,any disagreements were resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third author (MH).The conclusions are presented in the Risk of Bias table and incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>
<P>Where identified studies failed to report the primary outcomes of live birth, but reported interim outcomes such as pregnancy rates, informal assessment was undertaken as to whether those reporting the primary outcomes have typical values of the interim outcomes.</P>
<P>Even when included trials in a comparison group were statistically homogeneous, there were possible considerable differences in clinical features (clinical heterogeneity). These differences were taken into account when analysing and interpreting the pooled results. Clinical heterogeneity in subfertility (such as variation in entry criteria, subtle differences in the treatment used and which are important from a clinical aspect) cannot be avoided because most centres use their own protocols, which can vary in different aspects. When trials met the inclusion criteria and had performed the same intervention we considered it appropriate to pool their results.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-10-02 12:24:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. live birth rates), the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study were used to calculate Peto odds ratios.</P>
<P>For continuous data (e.g. dose of gonadotrophins), mean differences between treatment groups were calculated if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes.</P>
<P>The primary and some secondary outcome measures for this review used dichotomous data. Results for each study were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using Peto and Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect methods. Continuous data were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model or random effects model as appropriate according to the overall heterogeneity .</P>
<P>Where outcome data were reported as a percentage of the total number of participants, this was included in the analyses by multiplying the percentage number with the total number of participants (n) in that group and dividing by 100.</P>
<P>When continuous data were reported as mean with the standard error (SE) of the mean rather than standard deviation (SD), the SD was calculated using the formula SD = SE x square root of n (<LINK REF="STD-Jinno-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jinno 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pregnancy outcomes and number of retrieved oocytes are considered positive consequences of treatment, therefore, a higher proportion of women achieving pregnancy or having higher numbers of oocytes is considered a benefit. The use of GT and adverse effect outcomes are negative consequences so that higher numbers are considered to be detrimental.

Where the title or abstract identified a study as possibly for inclusion, or if there was any doubt about exclusion of a study, the full article was obtained for further evaluation. Of the remaining 15 studies identified as possibly for inclusion, three studies were eligible for inclusion in addition to the nine studies included in the original review.

</P>
<P>Three new comparison groups were added for this review update, while one comparison group from the original review had to be excluded as the study did not report per woman data. Therefore eight comparison groups were included for this update of which only one comparison group had up to three trials to combine to perform a meta-analysis . Of the eight comparison groups, three compared the trial intervention with treatment using the long protocol and three compared the trial intervention with modified long protocol. Of the other two, one compared low dose GnRHa flare up versus spontaneous natural cycle IVF and the other compared multiple dose GnRH antagonist versus mini-dose long agonist protocol.</P>
<P>
<B>(A) Protocols for pituitary down regulation </B>
<BR/>Six trials were analysed in four comparison groups to compare various protocols for down regulation. For purposes of this review, a long protocol is the conventional long protocol where down regulation is achieved by GnRHa, continued along with gonadotrophin (GT) until hCG administration. The protocols were as follows.</P>
<P>(1) Cessation of GnRHa on adequate down regulation (stop protocol) versus long protocol ( <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>). This group had one trial for analysis.</P>
<P>(2) GnRH antagonist versus long protocol had only one trial for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>(3) GnRH antagonist versus GnRHa flare-up protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2006</LINK>). The three trials had certain differences in their interventions: (a) <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK> included participants who had a poor response to a previous long protocol with a single dose GnRHa depot preparation, rather than a daily administered GnRHa preparation as in <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2006</LINK>. We combined the three trials for meta-analyses, as a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Albuquerque-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albuquerque 2005</LINK>) concluded that there was no difference in the clinical pregnancy rates for depot or daily GnRHa administration; (b) different starting doses of exogenous FSH; and (c) different criteria for administration of hCG in the GnRH antagonist groups in the three studies. However, as <LINK REF="REF-Albuquerque-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albuquerque 2005</LINK> concluded that the dose of GT administered was significantly higher in the GnRHa depot group and so we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK> when we analysed data for total dose of GT used in the two arms.</P>
<P>(4) Multiple dose GnRH antagonist versus mini-dose long agonist protocol had only one trial for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>(B) Protocols for modifying ovarian stimulation </B>
</P>
<P>Four trials, for four comparison groups, were analysed to compare protocols for COH. Each comparison had only one trial for analysis. Some utilised human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) or FSH alone, whereas others used both in combination. However, there was only one trial per intervention. The protocols were as follows.<BR/>(1) GnRHa flare-up protocol versus GnRHa long protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>(2) Low dose GnRHa flare-up protocol versus spontaneous or natural cycle IVF (<LINK REF="STD-Morgia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgia 2004</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>, 70 women were included to be able to detect a true effect of the non-stop protocol for a power of 80% at 5% level of significance. In <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>, the sample-size calculation was based on an expected reduction of 25% in the total FSH dose. With P value of 0.05 and 90% power, 22 women per group were needed to detect a significant difference. The sample size was estimated on the basis of the expected number of oocytes retrieved in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>). The reported mean number of oocytes retrieved in poor responders using a multi-dose GnRH antagonist protocol was taken as 5.89 (SD 3.02). Assuming an increment of two oocytes per retrieval as being clinically significant, 48 women in each arm were required to provide 90% power at the 5% significance level.</P>

</P>
<P>(1) <I>Cessation of GnRHa on adequate down regulation (stop protocol) versus long protocol.</I> This protocol was represented by one trial ( <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>), with 70 women in the trial.There was no evidence of a significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate per woman (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.74) between both groups.</P>
<P>When analysed using the fixed-effect model, the trial reported a higher total number of retrieved oocytes in the stop protocol treatment group (MD 2.50, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.88); women in the long protocol treatment group used a higher dose of exogenous GT (75 IU ampoules) (MD 11.40, 95% CI 9.94 to 12.86). Similar results were obtained when the random-effects model was used for analysis of both outcomes. There was no evidence of any difference in the cancellation rate between the two groups (OR 0.46 95% CI 0.04 to 5.29).</P>
<P>Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy rates were not reported.</P>
<P>
<I>(2) GnRH antagonist versus long protocol</I>. This protocol was represented by a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK>) with 30 women in each arm.<BR/>There was no statistically significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate per woman (OR 2.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 15.73). The ongoing pregnancy rate, although not statistically significant, was higher in the antagonist group compared to the long protocol treatment group (OR 10.36, 95% 0.53 to 201.45; P = 0.12).<BR/>There were higher numbers of retrieved oocytes in the GnRH antagonist treatment group (MD 1.30, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.27). GnRH agonist users in the long protocol treatment group used a higher dose of GT in ampoules (MD 23.30, 95% CI 20.42 to 26.18) and IU (MD 1747, 95% CI 1531.50 to 1963.42).<BR/>There was no difference in the cancellation rate (OR 4.46, 95% CI 0.47 to 42.51) or miscarriage rate (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.33). This trial did not report on ectopic pregnancy rate.</P>

The results from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2006</LINK> ) showed a significantly higher use of exogenous GT used in IU in the antagonist treatment group with the fixed-effect method (pooled MD 1575.00, 95% CI 852.87 to 2297.13 ); when re-analysed using the random-effect method there was no significant difference (pooled MD 11.21, 95% CI -6.88 to 29.31) in the dose of GT used in ampoules in the two groups. The results of the sensitivity analysis performed by excluding <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK> from the above analysis showed no significant difference in the use of exogenous GT in the two groups both by fixed effect method (2.50 (-1.57 to 6.57) P= 0.23) and the random effects model (2.50 (-1.57 to 6.57) P= 0.23).<BR/>There was no evidence of any difference in the cancellation rates (pooled OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.87) between the two groups.<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK> reported miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates. The miscarriage rates were not significantly different (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03 to 7.99) in the two groups. The OR for ectopic pregnancy was not estimable as there were no ectopic pregnancies in either intervention arm.</P>
<P>
<I>(4) Multiple dose GnRH antagonist versus mini-dose long GnRH agonist.</I> One trial was included in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>). There were 48 participants randomised to each group. Intention to treat analysis was not performed therefore 44 women in multiple dose GnRh antagonist group and 45 women in the mini-dose GnRH agonist group were analysed. The total dose of FSH used was significantly higher in the mini-dose long GnRH agonist group than in the multiple dose GnRH antagonist group (Pooled MD -1404.90, 95% CI -1785.95 to -1024.0). There was no statistically significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate per woman (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.42), and cancellation rate (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 6.65) between the two groups. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the number of oocytes retrieved (OR -0.03, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.78).

<P>Where meta-analyses were possible (comparison 4 only, GnRH antagonist versus GnRH flare -up protocol), the data were pooled .

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK> - The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly higher in the stop protocol compared to the conventional GnRHa long protocol (MD 2.50, 95% CI 2.12 to .88) and the total dose of GT in IU used was significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the stop protocol (comparison 1).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK> - The number of oocytes retrieved was significantly more in the GnRH antagonist group compared to the conventional GnRHa long protocol (comparison 2) ( MD1.30 , 05% CI 0.33 to 2.27). The total dose of GT used in IU and ampoules were significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the GnRH antagonist group (MD 1747.50, 95% CI 1531.58 to 1963.42 and MD 23.30, 95% CI 20.42 to 26.18) respectively.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK> - Women who received the long agonist protocol required higher amount of FSH in IU compared to women who received the multiple dose GnRH antagonist regimen (MD -1404.98, 95% CI -1785.95 to -1204.0, P&lt;0.00001) (comparison 6) . From the information gathered from such trials it is not always possible to evaluate the standard errors of the effect sizes and this introduces a large degree of imprecision in the results. It is difficult to conclude effectively on these results but it is an area that needs further research</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2007</LINK> - The total amount of recombinant FSH required in IU in the modified long protocol group was also higher in comparison to the women in the flare-up protocol group (MD -1192, 95% CI -1474.13 to -909.87, P&lt;0.00001). The number of oocyte retrieved in the flare up group was less compared to the modified long protocol group (MD -2.94, 95% CI -3.97 to -1.91) (comparison 7).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2008</LINK> - The number of oocytes retrieved (MD -3.54, 95%CI -4.54 to -2.54, P&lt;0.00001) was significantly higher in the modified long protocol group compared to the long protocol group (comparison 8). The total amount of recombinant FSH required in the modified long protocol group was also higher in comparison to the women in the long protocol group (MD -1127.0, 95% CI -1383.32 to -870.68, P&lt;0.00001). We wrote to the author who provided the mean +/- SD for the above outcomes, but the 95% confidence intervals were wide and therefore we could not assume that the data was normally distributed.</P>
<P>It was interesting to see that the numbers of retrieved oocytes were significantly lower in the long protocol treatment group, but conversely the cancellation rate was also lower, when compared to GnRHa flare-up protocols (comparison 3). There was no evidence of any difference in the cancellation rate between the conventional GnRHa long protocol versus stop or GnRH antagonist protocols (comparisons 1 and 2), although the latter two (stop and GnRH antagonist protocols ) had a significantly higher number of oocytes at retrieval. Of particular interest was the higher number of retrieved oocytes with lower doses of GT in the antagonist group when compared to the long protocol; with no difference in the pregnancy rates, cancellation rates or miscarriage rates (comparison 2). In this case it may be important to do a cost-benefit analysis of use of antagonist over the routine use of agonist for pituitary down regulation.</P>
<P>For all the comparison groups represented by single trials alone, although there is a statistically significant difference in many of the secondary outcomes it is difficult to be analytical about these as all the trials share similar weaknesses, as discussed above.</P>
<P>Thus, there is no clear evidence to support any particular intervention for controlled ovarian stimulation for poor responders in IVF. It is difficult to comment on how the clinical heterogeneity in the trials has affected the statistical significance of the analyses. More robust evidence is essential on a larger scale, with good quality randomised controlled trials and relevant outcomes, to ensure any clinically relevant conclusion. Until we achieve this clarity of evidence regarding the use of different interventions to overcome the problem of poor response in women having controlled ovarian stimulation, it is not possible to recommend any intervention to replace the currently used conventional long protocol.</P>

<BR/>There are inadequate randomised controlled trials of high quality which compare interventions with each other in the context of poor responders to ovarian stimulation. Most studies are of inadequate design and methodology. Some of the excluded trials compared more than one intervention in their treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Akman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirol-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Demirol 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2005</LINK>). Other trials pre-treated all participants with other interventions, such as the combined oral contraceptive pill (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunaydin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gunaydin 2007</LINK>). One trial did not compare similar groups for the intervention arms, and was hence excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Khalaf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khalaf 2002</LINK>). Most trials did not report per woman data (<LINK REF="STD-Jinno-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jinno 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were only ten trials suitable for inclusion in this review. However, as the majority of comparisons were represented by single trials we were unable to do a meta-analysis and hence could not draw any firm conclusions. This was compounded by insufficient information on some outcomes. Only one trial reported LBR per woman (<LINK REF="STD-Morgia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgia 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Method of randomisation was unclear in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK>). All studies had small sample sizes. While three had performed a power calculation the end-points were different, where two considered the number of retrieved oocytes (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>) and the other the dose reduction in exogenous GT requirements (<LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>).

<P>
<I>Definition of poor responders</I>
<BR/>The definition for poor responders used for this review was poor response (as defined by the authors) in a previous treatment cycle with a long protocol alone. There is a wide inconsistency in the definition of poor responders and consequently a few trials were excluded from this review. Even so, some trials compared intervention for rescue in the current treatment cycle (for those with a sub-optimal response defined by low estradiol levels or poor follicular response in the current treatment cycle) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Placido-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Placido 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Placido 2004</LINK>) and others included those with high early follicular phase FSH along with previous poor responders (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunaydin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gunaydin 2007</LINK>). One trial defined poor responders in the current treatment cycle by age alone (more than 40 years of age) (<LINK REF="STD-Sbracia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sbracia 2005</LINK>). One trial defined poor responders as those with a low antral follicle count at start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Klinkert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkert 2005</LINK>). The number of oocytes recovered in previous cycles known to have poor response also varied between studies. Studies defined poor responders as those women who had up to five oocytes retrieved (<LINK REF="STD-Reyftmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Reyftmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2007</LINK>a;<LINK REF="STD-Aletebi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aletebi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2008</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Lainas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lainas 2008</LINK>) and up to six follicles developed of varying diameters (<LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2006</LINK>). There is also some degree of confusion about what constitutes a poor response, which has been confused with unsuccessful IVF (which may be affected by various other involved factors) (<LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK>). Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rombauts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rombauts 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raga 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Akman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Akman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reyftmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Reyftmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lainas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lainas 2008</LINK>) could not be included in this review as they included participants who had a poor response in a previous treatment cycle but with different types of protocols (not a long protocol alone), which introduces bias as it assumes that all the protocols have the same efficacy. In one trial participants defined as poor responders also included those with occult ovarian failure (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Heterogeniety</I>
</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity between the trials could have been introduced by differences between the studies in terms of route of GnRHa administration (nasal or parenteral); differences between preparations of GnRHa, HMG and FSH; differences in the incremental dosage of GT; priming with OCP or estrogen,;reason of infertility; number of previous treatment cycles; IVF/ICSI treatment and criteria for hCG administration. However, within the trials, most baseline characteristics appeared balanced over the treatment groups. There is clinical heterogeneity in the trials whereby some trials have used HMG or rFSH or uFSH alone whereas others have used HMG and FSH in combination in the same cycle. However, there appears to be inadequate evidence about the advantages of HMG or FSH over each other for ovarian stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Wely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wely 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diversity in the definition of the outcomes was also identified as a problem. Clinical pregnancy was defined as positive pregnancy test, two consecutive serum beta hCG rises with ultrasound evidence of gestational sac (<LINK REF="STD-Morgia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgia 2004</LINK>) or ultrasound evidence of presence of an intrauterine gestational sac alone ( <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2007</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2008</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>). One study defined ongoing pregnancy as fetal heart beat seen on ultrasound between 10 to12 weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>). Some trials did not define clinical pregnancy at all (<LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>). Similarly, some trials only reported the number of mature (<LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>) or metaphase II oocytes and not the total number of oocytes. When reporting GT dose, some trials reported this in IU and others in ampoules, some have not mentioned the dose per ampoule in IU. Hence, dose of GT in IU could not be calculated for all studies. Whilst extracting data on cancellation rates;we found that some trials did not mention criteria for cancellation (<LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmusi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmusi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tazegul-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tazegul 2008</LINK>), others defined cancelled cycles as due to inadequate follicular response ( <LINK REF="STD-Marci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2005</LINK>) but did not define their criteria. Apart from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2008</LINK>) where cycles were cancelled when three or fewer growing follicles were found on day seven of controlled ovarian stimulation, none of the other included trials defined criteria for cycle cancellation.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in addition to the possible clinical heterogeneity there was also considerable statistical heterogeneity. When the stop protocol was compared with the long protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Velasco 2000</LINK>) significant statistical heterogeneity was identified and hence analysis was performed using the fixed-effect and the random-effect model. Where the P value suggested a significant result in the number of retrieved oocytes and dose of GT used on the fixed-effect model, this was no longer significant on applying the random-effects model. This was also the case with the dose of GT when comparing GnRH antagonist versus the GnRHa flare-up treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Marci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marci 2003</LINK>). Because of the limited number of trials in these instances, subgroup analyses could not be performed. Hence, these results are to be approached with caution.</P>
<P>
<I>Lack of appropriate outcome data</I>
<BR/>The primary outcome in this review was live birth rate (LBR) per woman. Of the ten trials, only one reported LBR per woman (<LINK REF="STD-Morgia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgia 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where meta-analysis was possible (only with comparison 4, GnRH antagonist versus GnRH flare-up protocol)), there was no difference in the clinical pregnancy rates. However, the lack of sufficient numbers of trials and possible clinical and statistical heterogeneity suggests that this evidence is insufficient to effectively make conclusions on the value of these interventions on pregnancy rates. In the other seven comparison groups with only one included trial, we were unable to provide any robust conclusions.</P>
<P>The other secondary outcomes considered for this review were number of oocytes retrieved per cycle and dose of exogenous GT used per cycle for ovarian stimulation. Where more than one trial reported these outcomes, a meta-analysis was performed. The other comparison groups with statistically significant results were represented by one trial alone. These results are difficult to interpret because of lack of adequate trials and very wide confidence intervals. The same reasons make it difficult to interpret any clinical significance of any particular treatment. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2006</LINK>) reported the total number of oocytes and dose of GT as median with 95% confidence intervals. We wrote to the authors but could not confirm the skewing of the data; we could not assume data to be normally distributed. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucuk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kucuk 2008</LINK>) reported the number of oocytes retrieved and total dose of recombinant FSH required as mean only. We wrote to the author who provided the mean +/- SD for the above outcomes, but the 95% confidence intervals were wide and therefore we could not assume that the data was normally distributed. Thus, from the information gathered from such trials it was not always possible to evaluate the standard errors of the effect sizes and this introduces a large degree of imprecision in the results.</P>
<P>Other secondary outcomes were possible adverse effects: cancellation rate for poor response, miscarriage rate and rate of ectopic pregnancy. For miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates there was only one trial per comparison group and hence we could not perform a meta-analysis. Data for adverse events was lacking in all the comparison groups.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to identify the use of any one particular intervention to improve treatment outcomes in poor responders in IVF. The results of this review should be balanced by a careful consideration of the small number of trials, small number of participants and the heterogeneity between the trials. Given the cost of the treatments and the lack of good evidence, it would seem reasonable to say that these interventions be used only within the context of clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A multicentre, well-designed, double blinded, randomised controlled trial in poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in the context of IVF, where the participants are clearly defined to have poor response in at least one previous conventional protocol and where poor response is defined strictly by the number of follicles recruited or number of oocytes retrieved, is warranted. We need an internationally accepted universal definition for poor responders which should be used in future trials. Other important components in designing such trials should be strict consideration of power calculations (based on clinically relevant outcomes such as live birth rate per couple and cancellation rates) and intention-to-treat analyses. It is also crucial to keep bias to a minimum by restricting the interventions to only one intervention in each arm of the trial to be randomised and compared, allowing the remaining participant characteristics and management to be as similar as ethically possible. Most of the drugs involved are expensive and it would be of great benefit to include an economic evaluation followed by a cost-effectiveness study for these interventions. </P>
