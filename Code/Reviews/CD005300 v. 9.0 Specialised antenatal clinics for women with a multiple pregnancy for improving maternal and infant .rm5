<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-17 15:59:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Women carrying more than one baby (multiple pregnancy) are at increased risk of complications which can affect the health of both mother and babies. We asked if 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with multiple pregnancies would improve outcomes for these women and their babies compared with attending standard antenatal clinics.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Babies of multiple pregnancies are more likely to be born too early (preterm birth) and to thus have problems with immature organs e.g. lungs. These babies are also less likely to survive. Women carrying more than one baby are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure, diabetes and bleeding. So it is important to see if specialised clinics during pregnancy can improve outcomes for these babies and mothers. These specialised clinics might include seeing the same midwife throughout pregnancy, having more antenatal appointments and additional information.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found one small study involving 162 women and their babies (searched date 31 May 2015). The quality of the study was very low to moderate for our outcomes. The study was too small to provide answers to our question as we were most interested in the chance of the babies being born too early, their health and whether they survived. We did find that mothers with multiple pregnancies were more likely to have a caesarean birth if they attended specialised multiple pregnancy clinics.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>There is insufficient good quality evidence to support the use of specialised clinics for women with multiple pregnancies. There is an urgent need for more good quality studies to answer this important question.</P>

<P>Findings were based on the results of a single study with some design limitations.</P>
<P>Data were available from one study involving 162 women with a multiple pregnancy. For the only reported primary outcome, perinatal mortality, we are uncertain whether specialised antenatal clinics makes any difference compared to standard care (risk ratio (RR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.03; 324 infants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Women receiving specialised antenatal care were significantly more likely to birth by caesarean section (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.81; 162 women, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Data were not reported in the study on the following primary outcomes: small-for-gestational age, very preterm birth or maternal death. There were no differences identified between specialised antenatal care and standard care for other secondary outcomes examined: postnatal depression (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.20; 133 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), breastfeeding (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.68; 123 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), stillbirth (RR 0.68; 0.12 to 4.04) or neonatal death (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.19 to 22.39) (324 infants).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-05 10:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-03 14:50:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a worldwide variation in the incidence of multiple pregnancies, ranging from 6.7 per 1000 births in Japan, to 40 per 1000 births in Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2010</LINK>). The incidence of monozygous twins is relatively constant at 3.5 per 1000 births, while the incidence of dizygous twins and higher-order multiple pregnancies varies with maternal age, parity, ethnicity and use of assisted reproductive techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1988</LINK>). Monozygous twins arise from fertilisation of one egg, while dizygous twins arise from fertilisation of two eggs. Women and infants of a multiple pregnancy are at increased risk of complications when compared with women and infants of a singleton pregnancy, but there is little information obtained from randomised controlled trials to provide reliable information about the optimal care of women with a multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-05 10:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Specialised clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy have been advocated, with non-randomised cohort data suggesting improved perinatal outcomes with the provision of intensive antenatal education, continuity of caregiver and individualised care (<LINK REF="REF-Ellings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellings 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gardner and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1990</LINK>) conducted a retrospective case note review of 62 women with a multiple pregnancy, where the antenatal care was considered to be 'adequate' (37 women) or 'inappropriate' (25 women). However, it was unclear exactly what constituted 'adequate' or 'inadequate' antenatal care. Women who received 'appropriate' antenatal care had a lower risk of perinatal mortality (68/1000 births versus 160/1000 births), and higher mean birthweight (2546 g versus 2007 g). The authors concluded that 'intensive' antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy was effective in promoting fetal growth and improving perinatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ellings and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ellings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellings 1993</LINK>) conducted a prospective cohort study in which 89 women with a twin pregnancy were followed in a specialised twin clinic and were compared with 51 women who did not attend the specialised clinic. The allocation of women to each clinic setting was not described. Care in the specialised twin clinic involved evaluation of maternal symptoms and cervical status by a single midwife, maternal education about the risk of preterm birth, individualised modification of maternal activity levels and the opportunity for non-attendance at clinic to be monitored and the women followed up. No differences were reported in the occurrence of antenatal complications. Infants of women who attended the specialised clinic were less likely to be of very low birthweight (defined as birthweight less than 1500 g), or require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and had a lower risk of perinatal death. The authors concluded that the intensive preterm birth prevention education, individualisation of antenatal care and frequent assessment by a single caregiver was effective in reducing very early preterm birth and its sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Ellings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellings 1993</LINK>). In a subsequent review, Newman and Ellings advocated the provision of antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy by "experienced and dedicated staff that can anticipate and manage the various and complex problems presented by the multi-fetal gestation" (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ruiz and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 2001</LINK>) conducted a retrospective cohort study where 30 women with a multiple pregnancy who received 'specialised' care were compared with 41 historical controls who received 'standard' care. The women in the 'specialised' care group had their care provided by a single midwife, including weekly antenatal visits, home visits and 24-hour availability for telephone support. The outcomes assessed included gestational age at birth, birthweight, length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and costs associated with hospitalisation. For those women who received 'specialised' care, there were no infants born before 30 weeks' gestation, the infants were of greater birthweight (mean 249 g, standard deviation (SD) 77 g), and had shorter neonatal intensive care unit stay (mean length of stay: seven days versus 17 days). The authors concluded that 'specialised' care for women with a twin pregnancy was associated with improved neonatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-03 14:57:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regular antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy is accepted practice, and while most women have an increase in the number of antenatal visits, there is no consensus as to what frequency schedule constitutes optimal care. Elevated blood pressure, hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are all increased in women with a multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Catov-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catov 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2000</LINK>), and increased antenatal visits should facilitate its early detection and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Santema-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santema 1995</LINK>). Women with a multiple pregnancy are reported to be at increased risk of gestational diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>). While there are some reports that suggest women with a multiple pregnancy are at increased risk of bleeding during pregnancy from placenta praevia or placental abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Ananth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ananth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salihu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salihu 2005</LINK>), frequent antenatal visits will not predict or prevent their occurrence. One of the greatest risks for infants of a multiple pregnancy is preterm birth. Birth before 37 weeks' gestation accounts for almost 45% of all twin births, compared with 5.6% in singleton pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDorman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDorman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1983</LINK>). For women with a multiple pregnancy, there is an increased risk of death of one or both of the babies, both in utero before birth (a stillbirth) and after birth when compared with women with a singleton pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Keith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keith 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rydhstroem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydhstroem 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline commissioned by the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health (NICE) relating to antenatal care of women with a multiple pregnancy highlights that current evidence is based on observational studies with potential for bias. Furthermore, the information available related to maternal morbidity, and both perinatal mortality and morbidity was assessed as of low to very low quality. While the RCOG recommendations advocate provision of clinical care by a multidisciplinary team with experience and knowledge relevant to twin pregnancies, further research as to the role of specialised antenatal care is required, including evaluation of the potential benefits and harms that may arise (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>While these reports suggest a potential improvement in neonatal outcomes associated with specialised care for women with a twin pregnancy, they are limited by their non-randomised nature, with inherent potential for bias. Furthermore, there is limited reporting of clinically meaningful outcomes for both women and infants. The value of specialised antenatal care for women with a single pregnancy when compared with 'standard' antenatal care is the subject of a different Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Whitworth-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitworth 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes.</P>

<LI>Caesarean birth</LI>
<LI>Postnatal depression at six months</LI>

<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>No cluster-randomised trials were identified for this version of the review. If such trials are identified in the future we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple pregnancies</HEADING>
<P>In our main comparison for neonatal outcomes, we used the number of babies as the denominator, whereas for maternal outcomes we used the number of women as the denominator.</P>
<P>This review focuses on multiple pregnancies and outcomes for babies from the same pregnancy (twins or higher multiples) are not independent. For some outcomes (e.g. preterm birth) outcomes for babies from the same pregnancy are likely to be the same, or very highly correlated. For other outcomes there will be a lower correlation (e.g. fetal death or infant anomaly). For breastfeeding outcomes, outcomes for twins or higher multiples are likely to be highly correlated although women may use different feeding methods for their babies depending on infant birthweight, behaviour or other considerations. To take account of the non-independence of outcomes for babies from multiple pregnancies we carried out a sensitivity analysis for infant outcomes where we treated each pregnancy as a cluster, and analysed data using methods described above for cluster-randomised trials. ICCs for individual outcomes were not reported for the trial included in the review, and we have not been able to identify published ICCs for twin pregnancy outcomes. We therefore estimated ICCs for the small number of outcomes reported for infants using a conservative ICC (assuming high correlation between outcomes for twins from the same pregnancy; e.g. if one twin was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, we assumed there would be an increased chance that the second twin from the same pregnancy would also be admitted compared with a baby from a different pregnancy). The effect of adjustment for correlation was to widen the 95% confidence intervals for outcomes for infants.</P>

<P>For the included study, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.

<P>In this version of the review only one study contributed data. In future updates if data from several studies are pooled, we will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I is greater than 30% and either a Tau is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.

<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-10-05 10:09:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We did not pool data, but if we do so in future updates we will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examine the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>We had prespecified two outcomes relating to maternal satisfaction with care: women not satisfied with care and women's preferences for care. These outcomes were not reported however, the numbers of women reporting in postal questionnaires that they were "very satisfied" with their antenatal care and with their overall care were reported. There was a trend towards women in the specialised care group being more likely to report being very satisfied with their antenatal care although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.67; 133 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There was no clear evidence that women receiving specialised antenatal care were more likely to be more satisfied with their overall care (including intrapartum care) (RR 1.28; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.79; 141 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit was not reported although the number admitted to special care was; the criteria for admission to special care was not defined. It appeared that infants of mothers receiving specialised care were more likely to be admitted to special care although data were not adjusted for any correlation between outcomes for twins from the same pregnancy (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.00, 324 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>For infant outcomes (perinatal death, stillbirth, neonatal death and admission to special care), we planned to carry out sensitivity analysis adjusting the data to take account of possible correlation between outcomes for twins from the same pregnancy. Using adjusted data (assuming an intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) of 0.5, and dividing event rates and sample sizes by 1.5 to take account of design effect), there was no evidence of a significant difference between groups for perinatal death or admission to special care (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) (due to very low event rates we were not able to adjust the data for stillbirth and neonatal death).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-03 15:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified one randomised controlled trial assessing the benefits and harms of 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy compared with 'standard' antenatal care, involving 162 women and 324 infants. While women in the specialised antenatal clinic were more like to have a caesarean birth, there was limited reporting of the other primary and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes prespecified in the review.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-02 12:35:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available literature is confined to one randomised trial, with limited reporting of primary and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-05 10:10:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The review is confined to one randomised trial, with limited reporting of primary and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes.</P>
<P>The included randomised trial provided limited information relating to maternal and infant health outcomes. Blinding for this type of intervention is generally not feasible and this may be a source of bias and no adjustment was made for possible correlation between outcomes for twins from the same pregnancy; the study was otherwise methodologically sound.</P>
<P>In this 2015 update, we have assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: perinatal death, caesarean birth, postnatal depression, breastfeeding six months' postpartum, small-for-gestational age and very preterm birth, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The evidence was assessed as being of moderate quality for caesarean section and very low for the other outcomes (perinatal death, postnatal depression, breastfeeding six months' postpartum). Two outcomes could not be assessed because they were not reported in the trial (small-for-gestational age and very preterm birth). For most important outcomes the evidence was not available, or was graded very low quality due to imprecise estimates, the small sample size of the single study providing data and low numbers of events for some outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-08-12 12:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to minimise bias during the review process by having two people assess the eligibility of studies, assess risk of bias and extract data with a third person involved to check or review each area. We attempted to be as inclusive as possible in our search.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-25 03:46:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While there are reports that suggest a potential improvement in neonatal outcomes associated with 'specialised' care for women with a twin pregnancy, they are limited by their non-randomised nature, with inherent potential for bias. Furthermore, there is limited reporting of clinically meaningful outcomes for both women and infants.</P>
<P>The value of 'specialised' multiple pregnancy clinics in improving health outcomes for women and their infants requires further evaluation by randomised controlled trials, with reporting of relevant maternal and infant health outcomes.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (17 January 2011).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>monthly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness search of a further 37 journals.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the 'Search strategies for identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are given a code (or codes) depending on the topic. The codes are linked to review topics. The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using these codes rather than keywords.</P>
<P>In addition, we searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2005, Issue 4) and PubMed (January 1966 to January 2006). Terms used in the database searches were "multiple pregnancy", "twin pregnancy", "antenatal care", "prenatal care".</P>
<P>We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>
