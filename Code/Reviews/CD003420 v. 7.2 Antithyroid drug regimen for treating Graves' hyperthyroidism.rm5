<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In this update we updated our search to April 2009. Three new randomised control trials were added to the review. These studies looked at different interventions from previous studies in the review and were assessed individually. One study looked at the addition of azathioprine to methimazole and this resulted in fewer relapses at follow up. The safety of adding a potentially toxic immunosuppressive agent will need to be assessed before this can have any clinical practice implications. Another study considered the use of a topical preparation of methimazole and hydrocortisone in a Han Chinese population. A pharmaceutical preparation of this ointment is not available outside China and the improved results in this group will need to be confirmed in different populations. The third addition is the first study comparing the effect on relapse rates from using propylthiouracil or methimazole. The results were comparable once the baseline differences in antibody status were considered and the numbers were too small to show any differential effect on side effects.</P>

<P>The four additional trials influenced the results of the two subgroups reported below. Twelve trials examined the effect of Block-Replace versus Titration regimen. The relapse rates were similar in both groups at 51% in the Block-Replace group and 54% in the Titration group (Peto OR = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-1.08). The number of participants reporting rashes was significantly higher in the Block-Replace group (10%, 63/616) as compared to the Titration group (5%, 31/622) (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.20-5.75). The number of participants withdrawing due to side effects was also significantly higher in the Block-Replace group.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 15:36:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>People who have Graves' hyperthyroidism have thyroid glands which are releasing too much thyroid hormone. This can cause goitres (swelling in the neck around the thyroid gland), sweating, bowel or menstrual problems, and other, especially eye symptoms (ophthalmopathy). Treatments include anti-thyroid drugs, surgery or radiation to reduce thyroid tissue. There are several choices to be made when considering the drug treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism including the choice of drug, dose, duration of therapy, addition of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) and when to discontinue therapy. The antithyroid drugs which were used in the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comprised carbimazole, propylthiouracil and methimazole. </P>
<P>Twenty-six RCTs involving 3388 participants were identified. The majority of participants in all the studies were female (83% in the studies reporting sex distribution). The mean age was 40 years. The duration of follow up was between two to five years in eleven trials. In high dose ('block-replace') versus low dose ('titration') studies the duration of therapy was six months in two studies, 18 months in four studies and 12 months in the remaining trials.</P>
<P>The main outcome was the relapse rate of hyperthyroidism over one year after completion of drug treatment and this was the primary outcome in all the studies assessed. There were no deaths reported in any of the studies. None of the studies detailed incidence of hypothyroidism, changes in weight during the course of therapy, health-related quality of life, ophthalmopathy progression or economic outcomes. The evidence (based on four studies) suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the low dose regimen is 12 to 18 months. The low dose regimen had fewer adverse effects than the high dose regimen and was no less effective in trials (based on 12 trials) of equal duration. Continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Studies using immunosuppressive agents need further validation of safety and efficacy in controlled trials among different populations.</P>
<P>Data regarding side effects and number of participants withdrawn from therapy due to side effects were available in seven studies. The number of participants reporting rashes was significantly higher in the high versus low dose group (10% versus 6%). The number of participants withdrawing due to side effects were also significantly higher in the high versus low dose group (16% versus 9%). </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-09 15:47:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Twenty-six randomised trials involving 3388 participants were included. Overall the quality of trials, as reported, was poor. None of the studies investigated incidence of hypothyroidism, changes in weight, health-related quality of life, ophthalmopathy progression or economic outcomes. Four trials examined the effect of duration of therapy on relapse rates, and when using the titration regimen 12 months was superior to six months, but there was no benefit in extending treatment beyond 18 months. Twelve trials examined the effect of block-replace versus titration block-regimens. The relapse rates were similar in both groups at 51% in the block-replace group and 54% in the titration block-group (OR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to1.08) though adverse effects (rashes (10% versus 6%) and withdrawing due to side effects (16% versus 9%)) were significantly higher in the block-replace group. Three studies considered the addition of thyroxine with continued low dose antithyroid therapy after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies and the difference between the two groups was not significant (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21). Four studies considered the addition of thyroxine alone after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was no significant difference in the relapse rates between the groups after 12 months follow-up (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.67). Two studies considered the addition of immunosuppressive agents. The results which were in favour of the interventions would need to be validated in other populations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:49:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 12:03:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (thyroxine,T4; triiodothyronine, T3). This is associated with a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin, which is secreted by the pituitary gland and regulates secretion of the thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland) level as too much thyroid hormone will reduce the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Hyperthyroidism is common and affects approximately 2% of women and 0.2% of men. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease (<LINK REF="REF-Franklyn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklyn 1994</LINK>). Graves' disease results from an interaction between genetic background (heredity), environmental factors and the immune system. For reasons that are not fully understood, the immune system produces an antibody (for example thyroid stimulating hormone (or thyrotropin) receptor antibody) that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. This is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 40 years, but can occur at any age in either sex. When Graves' disease occurs, the thyroid gland enlarges (called a goitre) and makes more and more thyroid hormone, resulting in symptoms such as weight loss, heat intolerance, irritability, anxiety, palpitations and tremors. Some people also develop eye problems (called Graves' ophthalmopathy), such as dry, irritated, prominent or red eyes, and double vision. Thickening of the skin of the lower legs is noted by some patients (pretibial myxoedema). Thyroid scanning (scintigraphy) with one of the radioisotopes of iodine or technetium-99m pertechnetate is an additional test which may be done, and, in Graves' hyperthyroidism there is a diffuse increase in the thyroid gland uptake.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:34:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The large published literature on the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism reflects the persisting controversies regarding best management of this common condition. There are three recognised treatment options for hyperthyroidism: antithyroid drugs, surgery and radioiodine. The use of radioiodine as a first-line therapy for hyperthyroidism is growing. It is well tolerated, with the only common long-term complication being the risk of developing radioiodine-induced hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland). Surgery, either subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy, has limited but specific roles to play in the treatment of hyperthyroidism: this approach is rarely used in patients with Graves' disease unless patients have declined radioiodine treatment or there is a large goitre causing symptoms of compression in the neck.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Up to 15% of people who take an antithyroid drug have minor side effects including itching, rash, hives, joint pain and swelling, fever, altered taste sensation, nausea, and vomiting. The major side effects like agranulocytosis (fall in white cell blood count), liver damage and vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) are fortunately very rare. Other medications which have antithyroid activity include lithium and perchlorate but their use is limited in the primary drug treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism due to their toxicity. Non-specific Immunosuppressive drug treatments have also been tried for the treatment of Graves' disease.</P>
<P>All three treatments for Graves' disease have their advantages and disadvantages. Absolute contraindications for each treatment are few.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:34:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Methimazole, carbimazole, and propylthiouracil are the mainstays of antithyroid-drug therapy. These drugs block the synthesis of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2005</LINK>). They may also help control the disease by indirectly affecting the immune system. Propylthiouracil also inhibits the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. Methimazole is the active metabolite of carbimazole, and since the conversion of carbimazole to methimazole in the body is virtually complete, their effects and equivalent doses are thought to be comparable. Antithyroid drug therapy can be given either by the block-replace regimen (where a higher dose of antithyroid drug is used to block hormone production with a replacement dose of thyroxine) or by a titration block-regimen (where the antithyroid drug dose is reduced by titrating treatment against serum thyroxine concentrations). </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:49:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Several randomised controlled trials of antithyroid therapies have been reviewed by Leech (<LINK REF="REF-Leech-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leech 1998</LINK>). This non-systematic review highlighted the controversies in the management of Graves' disease. The review discussed four prospective randomised controlled trials comparing relapse rates in block-replace and titration block-regimes (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonds-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonds 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jorde 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rittmaster-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rittmaster 1998</LINK>) and two prospective randomised controlled trials looking at the duration of antithyroid therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Allannic-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allannic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weetman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weetman 1994</LINK>). The preferred regimen and duration of therapy remain unresolved with various centres treating from between six to 24 months with either the block-replace or the titration block-regimen chosen on variable criteria. There have been no previous systematic reviews performed in this area.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-29 12:35:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>To assess the effects of antithyroid drug regimen and duration in the therapy of Graves' hyperthyroidism. We compared antithyroid drug use with the block-replace and the titration block-regime and also looked at studies comparing duration of therapy using either of these regimes. In addition we planned to review any studies directly comparing antithyroid drugs.</P>

<P>Two authors out of a panel of four assessed each trial independently. Possible disagreement were resolved by consensus, or with consultation of a third party in case of disagreement. Interrater agreement for key bias indicators (e.g. allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data) were calculated using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). In cases of disagreement, the rest of the group was consulted and a judgement was made based on consensus.</P>
<P>Methodological quality was independently assessed by two authors out of a panel of four (PA (assessed all trials), using a subject-specific modification of the generic evaluation tool used previously by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group. A sensitivity analysis was carried out based on the quality assessment. The assessment protocol scored each item between 0 and 2 as described below. In addition, risk of pre-allocation disclosure of assignment was rated A (adequate), B (unclear), C (inadequate) or D (not used). The following aspects of internal and external validity were reported and assessed:</P>
<P>a. Was the assigned treatment adequately concealed prior to allocation?<BR/>2 = method did not allow disclosure of assignment (A)<BR/>1 = chance of disclosure of assignment or states random but no description (B)<BR/>0 = quasi-randomised (C)</P>
<P>b. Were the outcomes of patients who withdrew included in the analysis (intention-to-treat)?<BR/>2 = intention-to-treat analysis based on all cases randomised possible or carried out<BR/>1 = states number and reasons for withdrawal but intention-to-treat analysis not possible, e.g. because outcomes were not measured<BR/>0 = not mentioned or not possible</P>
<P>c. Were the outcome assessors blinded to treatment status?<BR/>2 = action taken to blind assessors, or outcomes such that bias was unlikely<BR/>1 = chance of unblinding of assessors<BR/>0 = not mentioned</P>
<P>d. Were the treatment and control group comparable at entry?<BR/>2 = good comparability of groups, or confounding adjusted for in analysis<BR/>1 = confounding possible, mentioned but not adjusted for<BR/>0 = large potential for confounding, or not discussed</P>
<P>e. Were care programmes, other than the trial options, identical?<BR/>2 = care programmes identical<BR/>1 = differences in care programmes but unlikely to influence study outcomes<BR/>0 = not mentioned or differences in care programmes likely to influence study outcomes</P>
<P>f. Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly defined?<BR/>2 = clearly defined<BR/>1 = inadequately defined<BR/>0 = not defined</P>

There were 150 and 160 losses to follow up in the block-replace and titration block-groups respectively and when analysis was carried out assuming relapsed hyperthyroidism in all drop-outs there was again no significant difference between the two groups, with relapse rates of 63% (408/649) in the block-replace group and 68% (412/609) in the titration block-group (Peto OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.04).</P>
<P>On combining the data of these 11 studies as well as <LINK REF="STD-Tuncel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncel 2000</LINK> (with unknown dose and duration of therapy), the combined results were not associated with any significant difference between the groups. The relapse rates were similar in both groups at 51% (322/636) in the block-replace group and 54% (332/614) in the titration block-group (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08) when the losses to follow up are not considered. There were 234 and 223 losses to follow-up in the block-replace and titration block-groups respectively and when analysis was carried out assuming relapsed hyperthyroidism in all drop-outs there was a significant difference between the two groups, with relapse rates of 63% (549/870) in the block-replace group and 68% (566/837) in the titration block-group (Peto OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Two of the studies had very large losses to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Benker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benker 1998</LINK> with 44% (222 out of 509 participants) and <LINK REF="STD-McIver-B-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McIver B 1996</LINK> with 79% (81 out of 102)).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects and drug withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Data regarding side effects and number of participants withdrawn from therapy due to side effects were available in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmonds-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonds 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grebe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grebe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jorde 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclere-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leclere 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nedrebo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nedrebo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1996</LINK>). The number of participants reporting rashes was significantly higher in the block-replace group (9.8%, 61 participants out of 619) as compared to the titration block-group (5.8%, 36 participants out of 619) (Peto OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.69). This statistically significant difference was achieved even though the large study by <LINK REF="STD-Benker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benker 1998</LINK> contributing over half of these participants did not show a significant difference in the incidence of drug rashes between the two groups (7%, 18 participants out of 258 in the high dose group and 6%, 15 participants out of 251 in the low dose group reporting a drug rash). The block-replace group also had more participants with agranulocytosis (nine participants versus three) compared with the titration block-group but this effect was not statistically significant. There was one report of agranulocytosis by <LINK REF="STD-Rittmaster-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rittmaster 1998</LINK>, but the treatment group was not mentioned. The number of participants withdrawing due to side effects were also significantly higher in the block-replace group (16%, 58/353 participants in the block-replace group compared to 9%, 30/344 in the titration block-group; Peto OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.18).These differences are likely to be influenced by the fact that many of the patients may have experienced the side effects while they were on higher drug doses during the early phase of their titration block-regimen. It is notable that the study by <LINK REF="STD-Grebe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grebe 1998</LINK> using the 100 mg dose of carbimazole had seven out of 17 participants in the block replace withdrawing due to side effects including two cases of agranulocytosis and five participants with rashes.</P>

When a random-effects model was used the differences between the two groups were no longer significant (OR 0.58, 95% CII 0.05 to 6.21). A sensitivity analysis with the exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK> study also yielded no significant difference in the relapse rate between the thyroxine treated group (52%, 31 out of 59) versus the treatment group (42%, 28 out of 66) (Peto OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.14).</P>

Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Peixoto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peixoto 2006</LINK>) looked at relapse rates at one year follow up. This study compared the remission and relapse rates in Graves' disease and looked at the side effect profiles. Patients were randomised to either propylthiouracil (PTU) 200 to 300 mg twice daily or methimazole (MMI) 40 to 60 mg once daily and the doses were titrated down to a maintenance dose. The duration of therapy was 12 months and relapse rates were assessed one year after treatment withdrawal. In the PTU group the relapse rate was 29% (6/21) while this was 60% (15/25) in the MMI group (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.92). However, there were large difference in the TSH receptor antibody titres and the relapses rates were similar when this was adjusted for in the analysis. There were no major differences in the side effects and the numbers are too small to make any comment on this. The authors conclude that there were no significant differences in relation to relapse rates, side effect profiles or compliance rates between the two drugs.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:14:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several choices to be made when considering the drug treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism including the choice of drug, dose, duration of therapy, addition of thyroxine and factors to consider when discontinuing therapy. This review sought to examine the evidence available for these questions from the randomised controlled trials conducted in this field. The results of the review need to be interpreted with some caution as several of the trials had large losses to follow up. All the trials sought to follow up patients for over one year and the duration of follow up was between two to five years in seven trials. In the block-replace versus titration regimens, there was a total loss of follow up of 27%.</P>
<P>The antithyroid drugs which were used in these randomised controlled trials included carbimazole, propylthiouracil and methimazole. Carbimazole was used by 1395 participants in 14 trials and methimazole was used by 967 participants in seven trials. Propylthiouracil was used in at least 250 participants in two trials. There were no suitable randomised trials using lithium or perchlorate. No definitive comment can be made on the efficacy or side effect profile of the individual drugs. However, it does appear that carbimazole has a slightly more favourable side effect profile. Among the studies that reported rash, 7% (49/722) participants on carbimazole reported rashes, while there were reports of rashes in 12% (82/714) of participants on methimazole. This has to be interpreted with caution as there were no direct drug comparison studies and the numbers were extracted from several studies. Five cases of agranulocytosis occurred in participants on methimazole and seven cases in participants on carbimazole though it is noted that two of the cases among those on carbimazole were on exceptionally high doses of 100 mg per day.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Duration of therapy</HEADING>
<P>There is some evidence though not statistically significant that a 12 to 18 month duration of therapy is favoured to a shorter duration of therapy. This is stronger with use of the titration regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Allannic-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allannic 1990</LINK>) than for the block-replace regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Weetman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weetman 1994</LINK>). The 18 month titration regimen was significantly better than the 6 month regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Allannic-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allannic 1990</LINK>). Twelve months therapy was no less effective than 24 months titration regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Mayor-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Mayor 1992</LINK>). Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Mayor-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Mayor 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maugendre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maugendre 1999</LINK>) using longer duration of therapy did not show any clear evidence of benefit in extending therapy beyond 18 months though the confidence intervals were wide. In a single quasi-randomised study the six month block-replace regimen was no less effective than the 12 month therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Weetman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weetman 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cho-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 1992</LINK> has suggested that normalisation of TSH and TBII may be a useful marker in determining the length of therapy but this single trial was too small to assess this reliably.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Block-replace therapy versus titration therapy</HEADING>
<P>Longer term follow up data showed no clear evidence to suggest that the block-replace therapy reduced relapse rates when compared to the standard titration regimen. There appeared to be a difference when studies with only up to 24 month follow up were considered; suggesting that the relapses occurred later in the block-replace group. On combining the data from the shorter as well as longer-term studies, the relapse rates were similar in both groups at 51% (322/636) in the block-replace group and 54% (332/614) in the titration group when the losses to follow up were not considered. The results were sensitive to the way drop-outs were handled and when analysis was carried out assuming relapsed hyperthyroidism in all drop-outs there was a significant difference between the two groups, with relapse rates of 63% (549/870) in the block-replace group and 68% (566/837) in the titration group. This result will need to be interpreted with caution due to the large number of dropouts (27%; 457/1707) and also take into consideration the higher incidence of side effects in the block-replace regimen.</P>
<P>None of the studies showed significant differences in the rates of ophthalmopathy progression or looked at any quality of life indicators. There was in fact a significantly higher rate of drug withdrawal due to side effects, a significantly higher incidence of rashes and more episodes of agranulocytosis (no statistically significant difference) in the block-replace group. The use of higher doses (carbimazole 100 mg such as used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Grebe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grebe 1998</LINK>), led to high rates of side effects, including a 12% (2/17) incidence of agranulocytosis which is a potentially life threatening complication. The largest multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Benker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benker 1998</LINK>) did not use the titration regime but rather maintained the low dose group at methimazole 10 mg per day from the beginning.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Thyroxine supplementation after antithyroid drug therapy</HEADING>
<P>The evidence in favour of thyroxine supplementation after antithyroid drug therapy comes primarily from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK>). The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pfeilschifter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pfeilschifter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raber-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Raber 2000</LINK>) using combined antithyroid drugs with thyroxine, with the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pfeilschifter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pfeilschifter 1997</LINK>, continuing thyroxine after completion of antithyroid drugs did not show any clear difference in relapse rates. A sensitivity analysis, excluding the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK>, was not associated with a significant difference in the relapse rates following the addition of thyroxine. The discrepant result in the <LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK> study has been widely discussed considering various possibilities including the iodine intake in Japan and different immunological or genetic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Toft-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toft 1997</LINK>). However, there is no wholly satisfactory explanation about this, though it is noted that the trials which have subsequently tried to reproduce the results have all used varying protocols and none of the studies have used the original protocol used by <LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK> of antithyroid drugs for 18 months followed by thyroxine for 36 months. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Glinoer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Glinoer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoermann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hoermann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mastorakos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mastorakos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nedrebo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nedrebo 2002</LINK>) using thyroxine or placebo after completion of antithyroid drug therapy also failed to show a difference in relapse rates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Immunosuppressive therapies</HEADING>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials looked at immunosuppressive therapies. One Polish study (<LINK REF="STD-Huszno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huszno 2004</LINK>) looked at the addition of azathioprine to methimazole. The relapse rates were 8% (3/36) in the azathioprine group compared to 54% (15/28) in the methimazole group (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32). The safety and efficacy would need confirmation in further studies in different populations before the addition of a potentially toxic immunosuppressive agent is considered for the therapy of Graves' hyperthyroidism. One study in the Han Chinese population (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2008</LINK>) looked at using a compound antithyroid ointment (CATO) containing 12 mg of methimazole and 0.6 g of hydrocortisone and compared this with methimazole alone. The relapse rates at two years were 16%(12/72) in the CATO group and 42% (29/69) in the methimazole group (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60). This would also need confirmation in different populations before the results can be generalisable. There is no topical preparation of methimazole which has undergone pharmaceutical preparation or testing outside China. There has been more recent interest in possible immunotherapy for Graves' disease. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which causes B cell depletion in the circulation as well as the thyroid has been studied in a few phase 2 clinical trials. This shows some promise in Graves' ophthalmopathy and some benefit in hyperthyroidism but needs further evaluation and confirmation in clinical trials.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-23 17:36:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence (based on four studies) suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the titration block-regimen is 12 to 18 months. The six month block-replace regimen was found to be as effective as the 12 month treatment in one quasi-randomised study. </P>
<P>The titration block-(low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the block-replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective in trials (based on 12 trials) of equal duration. </P>
<P>Continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism.</P>

<P>The results should be generalisable as the studies included participants from 16 countries (bearing in mind the limitations noted due to the large participant loss to follow up). The results obtained from trials in different countries were broadly consistent. The notable exception is the study from Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Hashizume-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hashizume 1991</LINK>) and it is uncertain if there are other genetic or immunological factors which could have influenced this. Another exception would be a study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2008</LINK>) of compound antithyroid ointment which is unavailable outside China and conducted solely in the Han Chinese population.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-11-09 15:11:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The major limitation of the review is the large number of participants lost to follow up in the studies. In the block-replace versus titration regimens, there was a total loss of follow up of 27%. The reasons for the large loss to follow up are unclear and this may include: patients feeling relatively well a few weeks after commencement of therapy and attainment of euthyroidism; relatively young age group of patients likely to have work and other commitments such that once euthyroidism is attained, they fail to comply with therapy and have a variable lag period before a relapse occurs; there may be other motives leading to poor compliance with therapy including maintenance of weight loss in young to middle aged women.</P>

<P>The evidence suggests that the duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the titration regimen should be between 12 to 18 months. The six month block-replace regimen was found to be as effective as the 12 month treatment in one quasi-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Weetman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weetman 1994</LINK>).<BR/>The titration regimen appeared to have fewer side effects than the block-replace regimen and there was no clear evidence to suggest this was less effective. The incidence of drug rashes and drug withdrawal due to side effects were significantly higher in the block-replace regimen.<BR/>There does not appear to be any benefit of continued thyroxine replacement following antithyroid drug therapy with regard to relapse rates of hyperthyroidism though the remarkable results of one study suggesting benefit remain unexplained.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-09 15:13:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Large, well designed, adequately powered trials of block-replace therapy versus titration therapy with monitoring of ophthalmopathy changes are needed to see if the regimens are different in this regard. Attempts should be made to reduce the number of participants lost to follow up. A common reason for considering block-replace in many centres is to avoid transient periods of hypothyroidism while titrating the antithyroid drug dose. A large well designed study designed to look for quality of life issues and possible effects of transient undetected episodes of hypothyroidism during the initial period of the titration regimen in comparison with the block-replace regimen would help clarify this aspect of management.</P>
<P>Direct comparisons of the three commonly used drugs should be considered as there seems to be some suggestion that carbimazole may have a more favourable safety profile.</P>
