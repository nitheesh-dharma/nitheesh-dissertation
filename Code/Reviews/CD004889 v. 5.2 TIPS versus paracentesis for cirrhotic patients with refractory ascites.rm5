<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Patients with refractory ascites may temporarily benefit from transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Refractory ascites causes substantial morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Randomised trials have compared transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts with paracentesis. Mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or infection did not differ significantly between the two intervention groups. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts effectively decreased the risk of ascites fluid re-accumulation, but was associated with an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Refractory ascites (ie, ascites that cannot be mobilized despite sodium restriction and diuretic treatment) occurs in 10 per cent of patients with cirrhosis. It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality with a one-year survival rate of less than 50 per cent. Few therapeutic options currently exist for the management of refractory ascites.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts (TIPS) versus paracentesis for the treatment of refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(January 2006), the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 4, 2005), <I>MEDLINE</I> (1950 to January 2006), <I>EMBASE</I> (1980 to January 2006), <I>CINAHL </I>(1982 to August 2004), and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> (1945 to January 2006). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised clinical trials comparing TIPS and paracentesis with or without volume expanders for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials by the generation of the allocation section, allocation concealment, and follow-up. Two authors independently extracted data from each trial. We contacted trial authors for additional information. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five randomised clinical trials, including 330 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The majority of trials had adequate allocation concealment, but only one employed blinded outcome assessment. Mortality at 30-days (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 10.06, P = 1.0) and 24-months (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.56, P = 0.5) did not differ significantly between TIPS and paracentesis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts significantly reduced the re-accumulation of ascites at 3-months (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18, P &lt; 0.01) and 12-months (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28, P &lt; 0.01). Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.6, P &lt; 0.01), but gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and acute renal failure did not differ significantly between the two groups. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The meta-analysis supports that TIPS was more effective at removing ascites as compared with paracentesis without a significant difference in mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and acute renal failure. However, TIPS patients develop hepatic encephalopathy significantly more often.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:10:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Ascites refers to the pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity and develops as a result of elevated portal-vein pressure in 35% to 50% of patients with cirrhosis within 10 years of diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1995</LINK>). Ascites can adversely impact quality of life by causing disabling symptoms such as fatigue, malnutrition, bacterial infections, and dyspnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Arroyo-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroyo 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Such-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Such 1998</LINK>). It also has an effect on mortality with a mean survival of two years after the onset of ascites (<LINK REF="REF-Arroyo-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroyo 1996b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initial treatment of ascites consists of dietary sodium restriction and administration of oral diuretics. However, approximately 10% of affected patients develop refractory ascites (<LINK REF="REF-Arroyo-1996c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroyo 1996c</LINK>), which is defined as an inability to effectively mobilize the fluid despite compliance with the aforementioned treatment regimen or an inability to tolerate aggressive diuresis due to the development of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Llach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llach 1988</LINK>). The development of refractory ascites has a particularly poor prognosis with an associated one-year mortality rate of 50% to 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salerno-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gines-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gines 1996a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few therapeutic options exist for patients who develop refractory ascites, including direct removal of fluid via large-volume paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), and ultimately liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Arroyo-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroyo 1996b</LINK>). Paracentesis is a relatively simple and safe procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Runyon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runyon 1999</LINK>), and it can be performed in the outpatient setting, providing many patients with immediate relief (<LINK REF="REF-Arroyo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroyo 1994</LINK>). However, it does not treat the underlying etiology of ascites development, and thus, does not prevent recurrence. TIPS involves the shunting of portal blood flow past the liver into the systemic circulation, which decompresses the portal system and removes the impetus for ascites formation (<LINK REF="REF-Colapinto-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colapinto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferral-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferral 1993</LINK>). TIPS has gained popularity because of the ease of insertion without requiring general surgery and the relative effectiveness of the procedure. Complications associated with TIPS include stent occlusion, encephalopathy, infections, and renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Gines-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gines 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schiffman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffman 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>). Liver transplantation is another treatment option for patients with refractory ascites. However, with the introduction of the Mathematical End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score, ascites is not often used to estimate severity of liver disease, and patients may have prolonged waiting times for liver transplantation despite suffering from refractory ascites (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review by us (<LINK REF="REF-Saab-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saab 2004</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>In the present study, we sought to compare the overall mortality rate, treatment efficacy, and complications of TIPS versus paracentesis. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:10:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Searches were conducted in duplicate, and data extraction was performed independently by two authors (SS and JMN) and confirmed by consensus.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Application of inclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>Initially, all identified trials were entered in a trials register. Two authors (SS and JMN) independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified studies. When a difference of opinion existed on whether to include a particular study or on the data extracted, the third author (BAR) was consulted to reach consensus. When data on specified outcomes or individual patients were absent, the authors were contacted and asked to supply further details where possible.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>The two authors (SS and JMN) extracted the following prespecified characteristics for all included trials independently:</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>Age, sex, etiology of the underlying liver disease, severity of the liver disease according the Child-Pugh criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Pugh-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugh 1973</LINK>), presence or absence of hepatic encephalopathy, and the degree of renal dysfunction as determined by serum creatinine were recorded.</P>
<P>Patients with refractory ascites due only to cirrhosis and portal hypertension were included. The diagnosis of liver disease could be made via a combination of biochemical and clinical data. The definition of refractory ascites in the individual trial was assessed by the following criteria, at least one of which needed to be met: (1) intensive diuretic therapy for at least one week; (2) mean loss of weight less than 200 g/day during the last four days of diuretic treatment and urinary sodium excretion lower than 2 g/day; (3) dietary sodium restriction to 2 g/day; (4) spironolactone 400 mg/day plus furosemide 160 mg/day; (5) recurrence of grade 2 to 3 ascites within four weeks of initial mobilization or within three days after paracentesis; (6) significant adverse effects associated with attempted diuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Gines-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gines 1996a</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Interventions</I>
</B>
<BR/>In the TIPS group, the type and number of shunts, shunt diameter, any co-administered anticoagulation, success of shunt placement, and reduction in portal pressure were registered. The alternative treatment was paracentesis, for which the number of paracenteses performed, the ascitic volume removed, and volume expander (use, type, and dose) were registered. Medical management (sodium restriction and diuretic use) and co-interventions were allowed if used in both arms of the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcome measures</I>
</B>
<BR/>The mortality rate, efficacy as measured by re-accumulation of ascites, and occurrence of complications were recorded. The associated complications that were included in the analysis were: hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infection/septicaemia. The definition of ascites improvement could be subjective or objective, or both through evaluation of abdominal distention, edema, body weight, or ultrasound, or not defined.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>
</B>The methodological quality, defined as the confidence that the design and report will restrict bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>), was evaluated independently by the authors. According to empirical evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) we assessed the methodological quality by the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up.</P>

<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method, ie, all randomised patients were included, and patients that did not meet the outcome measure were considered failures. We used the statistical package RevMan 4.2.8 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. A random-effects model was employed due to the anticipated variability between trials in terms of patient populations, interventions, and concomitant interventions (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses were performed on clinically important outcomes and to determine the cause of heterogeneity, if it existed (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Levels of clinical significance were set at P &lt; 0.05, and significant heterogeneity was set at P &lt; 0.10.</P>

</B>Among the 96 references that were identified, we excluded 28 duplicates and 41 irrelevant references by reading the abstracts. Of the remaining 27 references, we excluded 19 for the following reasons: the studies were not randomised (n = 7), TIPS was not compared to medical therapy (n = 8), surgical therapy as opposed to TIPS was compared (n = 2), or the criteria for refractory ascites were not met (n = 2). Of the remaining eight references, three were abstracts of preliminary data of two of the randomised clinical trials used in this study.</P>

<B>Trial characteristics</B>
<BR/>The five included randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>) were published as peer-reviewed, original articles (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). They included a total of 330 patients, of whom 162 underwent TIPS and 168 underwent paracentesis. The group undergoing medical therapy was treated with diuretics, dietary sodium restriction, and large-volume paracentesis as indicated. The TIPS arm was prescribed diuretics and sodium intake restriction, and underwent an initial paracentesis before the TIPS procedure with repeat paracentesis as needed. Paracentesis with infusion of 8 g of albumin per litre of ascitic fluid removed was performed in four of the randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). One trial did not report the amount of albumin used with paracentesis (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of people in each trial ranged from 25 to 109 (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). Men composed 69% of the patients. The cause of underlying disease was described in all of the patients, and 65% had alcoholic cirrhosis. The mean Child-Pugh score ranged from 8.7 to 9.3. The mean success rate of TIPS placement was 84% (range 45% to 97%). Portal pressure gradient was reduced from 20 ± 1 mmHg to 13 ± 1 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>), from 19.1 ± 0.8 mmHg to 8.7 ± 0.4 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>), 24 ± 6 mmHg to 10 ± 4 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>), 19.8 ± 4.8 mmHg to 8.3 ± 3.6 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>), and 22.5 ± 1.1 mmHg to 8.7 ± 0.6 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). In the paracentesis group from each study, a single large volume paracentesis was performed to completely remove ascites at the start of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). In three of the trials, there was no record of the volumes of initial ascitic fluid removed (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). Gines et al noted that the initial paracentesis had a mean volume of 7.4 L (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>), and Sanyal et al noted that the mean volume removed from the two months prior was 17 L for the TIPS group and 19 L for patients undergoing paracentesis (<LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recurrent ascites was defined clinically in all trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). The development of moderate or tense ascites and the need for large volume paracenteses was perceived as treatment failure (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>According to the results of this study, which compared the role of TIPS versus paracentesis for the treatment of refractory ascites due to cirrhosis, TIPS is more efficacious in clearly ascites at 3- and 12-month intervals, despite no difference in short- or long-term mortality between the two treatments options. Although there was no significant increase in the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding, infection/septicemia, and acute renal failure, there was a greater incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group.</P>
<P>There was no overall difference in survival between patients treated with TIPS compared with those who underwent management with paracentesis, even in patients with Child-Pugh class C (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). One trial did identify a higher mortality in patients who underwent TIPS with Child-Pugh class C (P = 0.027) (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>), but this was not confirmed in the other trials. More studies are needed to assess the impact of liver disease severity on survival after TIPS (<LINK REF="REF-Russo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russo 2003</LINK>). In addition, other measures of disease severity, such as the MELD score, should be incorporated in future analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Malinchoc-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinchoc 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our study demonstrated an increase risk of hepatic encephalopathy in patients treated with TIPS, as was reported in several studies in terms of both frequency and severity (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrec-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrec 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>). A previous history of encephalopathy is a predictor of post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy, so this finding is somewhat surprising given the exclusion criteria of grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salerno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salerno 2004</LINK>) and history of chronic encephalopathy in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 2002</LINK>) at the time of enrollment. As a potential explanation for this finding, patients with a history of severe hepatic encephalopathy may not have been excluded if their encephalopathy was aggressively controlled at the time of screening, or patients may have had mild, or subclinical, encephalopathy that did not meet criteria for exclusion.</P>
<P>Our study focused on two treatments of refractory ascites: TIPS and medical management. Another treatment option includes peritoneovenous shunts, which work by an alternative mechanism and rely on the difference between intrathoracic and peritoneal pressure to return ascitic fluid to the vasculature. Although several studies have reported on the efficacy of peritoneovenous shunts in the treatment of refractory ascites (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1996</LINK>), we did not include this treatment modality in the study because these shunts have fallen out of favor in clinical practice due to the frequency of complications, including occlusion and associated infections (<LINK REF="REF-Zervos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zervos 1997</LINK>). In one study of 48 patients, 13 patients underwent shunt revisions because of occlusion or infection (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several limitations in the trials comparing TIPS and paracentesis that should be addressed. First, blinding of outcome analysis was not discussed in the published trials, and thus, the efficacy and safety of invasive treatments may have been over-estimated (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Also, quality of life assessment was not incorporated in most trials. Patient-oriented measures need to be assessed. For instance, does the risk of hepatic encephalopathy outweigh the relief from refractory ascites?</P>
<P>Quality of life was only assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>), despite its importance as an outcome measure when comparing invasive treatments. Both the physical and mental components of the questionnaire (SF-36) improved after treatment in the two groups, although there was no statistical difference between the groups. Improvement in ascites control with any therapeutic measure may have overshadowed differences in quality of life between interventions. Future studies should consider disease specific quality-of-life instruments that may be more sensitive to changes in the quality of life in patients with liver disease.</P>
<P>The published trials were initiated prior to standard use of the MELD score to predict TIPS mortality and prior to development of the covered stent (<LINK REF="REF-Malinchoc-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinchoc 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bureau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bureau 2004</LINK>). Covered stents appear to remain patent significantly longer than uncovered stents, and in one nonrandomised trial, there was a survival advantage associated with the covered stent (<LINK REF="REF-Angermayr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angermayr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bureau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bureau 2004</LINK>). Other studies incorporating MELD score and covered stents should now be considered.</P>
<P>Data on rehospitalization were not complete, limiting the analysis of the impact of either treatment modality on the need for repeat hospitalizations. In three of the five trials, rehospitalization rates were not discussed, and in the remaining two trials, the rehospitalization rate was given in terms of unscheduled hospital visits and not rehospitalization due to recurrence of ascites (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyal 2003</LINK>). Only one study made a statistical comparison, which showed that rehospitalization rates due to unscheduled visits were similar in both the TIPS and paracentesis group (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_ssle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rössle 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conclusion, our results indicate that TIPS effectively decreases the re-accumulation of ascitic fluid for up to 12 months without concomitant increase risk of mortality in properly selected patients with refractory ascites. However, this comes at the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which was significantly more common in patients treated with TIPS. Future studies need to employ quality of life outcomes to determine if the risks of encephalopathy from TIPS are outweighed by alleviation of refractory ascites.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Patients with refractory ascites benefit from improved control of their ascites without an associated increase in mortality. However, patients should be advised regarding the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials should report long-term follow-up of patients undergoing TIPS for refractory ascites. Quality of life measures and costs should be incorporated in further trials, which should use adequate methods for conduct and report (http://www.consort-statement.org).</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>Changes performed in the protocol section of this systematic review:</P>
<P>In the published version of the protocol 'Surgical versus medical treatment of refractory ascites' Saab et al, Issue 2, 2002, we intended to let the decision, between using a fixed-effect model or a random-effects model to analyze the data, depend on homogeneity or heterogeneity among the included trials. However, this approach is no longer endorsed by The Cochrane Collaboration and we followed their recommendations.</P>
<P>Further, for clarity we decided to divide the protocol into two parts. Thus, this first review on TIPS versus paracentesis is prepared and is updated for issue 4 2006 of The Cochrane Library. The second review is not prepared yet, but it will compare peritoneovenous shunts and medical treatment.</P>
