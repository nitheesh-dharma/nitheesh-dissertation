<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-11 17:04:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that methylxanthines (caffeine and theophylline) are effective in the short-term for reducing apnoea in premature babies.</P>
<P>Apnoea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks gestation). Methylxanthines (such as theophylline and caffeine) are drugs that are believed to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used to reduce apnoea. Adverse effects of feeding intolerance and a rapid heart rate have been found with theophylline. The review of trials found that methylxanthines help reduce the number of apnoea attacks in the short term. The one new trial included in this review that published longer term outcomes (up to term equivalent age and in later infancy) demonstrated that caffeine therapy has lower rates of longer term side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-06 11:20:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent apnoea is common in preterm infants, particularly at very early gestational ages. These episodes of ineffective breathing can lead to hypoxaemia and bradycardia that may be severe enough to require the use of positive pressure ventilation. Methylxanthines (such as caffeine, theophylline or aminophylline) have been used to stimulate breathing and reduce apnoea and its consequences.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-11 17:24:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials reported on the effect of methylxanthine in the treatment of apnoea (three trials of theophylline and three trials of caffeine). Five trials that enrolled a total of 192 preterm infants with apnoea evaluated short term outcomes; in these studies, methylxanthine therapy led to a reduction in apnoea and use of IPPV in the first two to seven days. The <I>post-hoc</I> analysis of the large CAP Trial comparing caffeine to control in a subgroup of infants being treated for apnoea reported significantly reduced rates of PDA ligation; postmenstrual age at last oxygen treatment, last endotracheal tube use, last positive pressure ventilation; and reduced chronic lung disease at 36 weeks.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-09 14:23:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthine is effective in reducing the number of apnoeic attacks and the use of mechanical ventilation in the two to seven days after starting treatment. Caffeine is also associated with better longer term outcomes. In view of its lower toxicity, caffeine would be the preferred drug for the treatment of apnoea.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-11 17:04:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infant apnoea has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds or one of less than 20 seconds and associated with cyanosis, marked pallor, hypotonia or bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of apnoea are common in preterm infants and the incidence and severity increases at lower gestational ages (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>). Although recurrent apnoea can occur spontaneously and be attributed to prematurity alone, it can also be provoked or made more severe if there are additional insults such as infection, hypoxaemia or intracranial pathology.</P>
<P>If prolonged, apnoea can lead to hypoxaemia and reflex bradycardia which may require active resuscitative efforts to reverse. There are clinical concerns that these episodes might be harmful to the developing brain or cause dysfunction of the gut or other organs. Frequent episodes may be accompanied by respiratory failure of sufficient severity to lead to intubation and the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 16:34:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines are thought to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used in clinical practice to reduce apnoea since the 1970's (reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Comer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comer 2001</LINK>). Theophylline and caffeine are two forms that have been used.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 16:34:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism of action of methylxanthine is not certain. Possibilities include increased chemoreceptor responsiveness (based on a lower threshold for breathing responses to CO<SUB>2</SUB>), enhanced respiratory muscle performance and generalized central nervous system excitation.</P>
<P>Adverse effects such as feed intolerance and tachycardia have been reported in observational studies, particularly with theophylline therapy. There are potential adverse effects secondary to increased central nervous system stimulation on long term development of the nervous system, although this has not been suggested from cohort studies. The increased metabolic rate induced by methylxanthines could increase the rate of blood oxygen desaturation during apnoea, even if the rate of events were reduced. A metabolic load, if sustained, could affect growth. Issues of neonatal morbidity have been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1999</LINK>).</P>

Details of these studies are included in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>One trial reported on the use of oral theophylline (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>) and two used the intravenous equivalent, aminophylline (<LINK REF="STD-Peliowski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peliowski 1990</LINK>) or theophylline (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>). Two trials examined the effects of caffeine (<LINK REF="STD-Murat-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murat 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials except <LINK REF="STD-CAP-Trial-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP Trial 2006</LINK> measured apnoea/bradycardia consistent with clinical events as defined in Background (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>). These were recorded from clinical monitors in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>) and by chart records of apnoea and heart rate in the remaining three (<LINK REF="STD-Murat-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murat 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peliowski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peliowski 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>). The timing of outcome assessments varied from 48 hrs to 10 days after initiation of treatment.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK> trial, a large number of infants exited from double blind treatment during the 10 day study period and failure was determined on the day of exit and "carried forward over the subsequent days" (the status on day seven when responses were stable was taken for the result presented here).</P>
<P>The original CAP trial publications in 2006 and 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-CAP-Trial-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP Trial 2006</LINK>) examined the primary outcome of death or disability up to 18 to 21 months corrected age in preterm infants randomised to either caffeine or placebo. The CAP Trial Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-CAP-Trial-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP Trial 2006</LINK>) recently published their findings following a <I>post-hoc</I> subgroup analysis of the original results of the CAP trial. This included an analysis of outcomes according to the indication for treatment which included the subgroup treated for apnoea. The authors caution that the original randomisation was not stratified by indication for treatment and hence that &#8220;caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these subanalyses&#8221;.  Frequency or severity of apnoea was not an outcome of the CAP trial. Two other indications in the trial and published results were prophylactic methylxanthine for apnoea of prematurity or prophylactic methylxanthines for extubation in preterm infants. The latter are potentially eligible for two other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Comparison 1: Any methylxanthine vs control (including subgroup analysis of trials utilizing theophylline and trials using caffeine)</B>
</P>
<P>Five trials evaluated short term effects of methylxanthine treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murat-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murat 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peliowski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peliowski 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>). In these five trials comparing the short term effects of methylxanthine with control (placebo or no drug therapy), those infants with recurrent apnoea of prematurity receiving methylxanthine have less treatment failure of apnoea [summary RR 0.44 (95%CI 0.32 to 0.60), RD -0.40 (95%CI -0.53 to -0.28), NNT 3 (95%CI 2 to 4)] and less use of IPPV [RR 0.34 (95%CI 0.12 to 0.97), RD -0.08 (95%CI -0.16 to -0.01), NNT 13 (95%CI 6 to 100)]. These effect sizes are large although the sample sizes are low.</P>
<P>These effects were analysed in the short term only, with two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peliowski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peliowski 1990</LINK>) evaluating effects 48 hours after randomisation, another study at five days (<LINK REF="STD-Murat-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murat 1981</LINK>), and the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>) at one week. Although <LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK> claimed that there were no benefits by seven days, the mean number of apneic events was analysed only in the subgroup that did not require mechanical ventilation.<BR/>
<BR/>The results were similar across trials. Analysis of the three trials in which theophylline was used also showed significantly less treatment failure [summary RR 0.42 (95%CI 0.28 to 0.63), RD -0.50 (95%CI -0.67 to -0.33), NNT 2 (95%CI 1 to 3)] and a reduction in use of IPPV that nearly reaches statistical significance. The two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Murat-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murat 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>) evaluating caffeine found significantly less treatment failure [summary RR 0.46 (95%CI 0.27 to 0.78), RD -0.31 (95%CI -0.49 to -0.12), NNT 3 (95%CI 2 to 8)].</P>
<P>The difference in the low rate of death before discharge (methylxanthine 3/81 versus control 6/73, RR 0.49, 95%CI 0.14 to 1.78) reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK>) is not significant.<BR/>
<BR/>Short term side effects were reported in three trials. Two reported that there were none (<LINK REF="STD-Peliowski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peliowski 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1981</LINK>) reported that two infants in the theophylline group developed tachycardia. <LINK REF="STD-Erenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erenberg 2000</LINK> provided the additional information that no infants had side effects such as tachycardia or feed intolerance leading to omission of treatment.</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental outcomes in infancy (at 18 to 21 months corrected age) as well as short term neonatal outcomes were reported in the <LINK REF="STD-CAP-Trial-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP Trial 2006</LINK> for the subgroup enrolled for the indication of apnoea. The relative risk of having patent ductus arteriosus ligation was reduced in the caffeine group (RR 0.37; 95%CI 0.21 to 0.66). The postmenstrual age at last oxygen use was reduced in the caffeine group (mean difference, RR -0.90 weeks; 95%CI -1.54 to -0.26). The postmenstrual age at the time of last endotracheal tube use was reduced in the caffeine group (mean difference RR -0.60 weeks; 95%CI -1.03 to -0.17). The postmenstrual age at last positive pressure ventilation was lower in the caffeine group (mean difference, RR -0.90; 95%CI -1.32 to -0.48). The risk ratio of chronic lung disease (BPD) at 36 weeks PMA was significantly less in the caffeine group (RR 0.72; 95%CI 0.58 to 0.89). The risk ratio of cerebral palsy in long term follow up in infancy was lower, but not significantly (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.25). The risk ratio of death or major disability by late infancy was not significantly different, but there was a trend favouring the caffeine group (RR 0.85; 95%CI 0.71 to 1.01).</P>

<P>This review and the other Cochrane reviews dealing with the other two indications for methylxanthine therapy (for the prevention of apnoea and for the prevention of extubation failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2006</LINK>) allow for a more precise understanding of the effects in these related, but different populations. Data here and in another systematic review comparing caffeine and theophylline (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2010</LINK>) suggest that the short term benefits of caffeine are similar to those of theophylline. Short term side effects, such as tachycardia or feed intolerance, appear to be less common with caffeine (reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Comer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comer 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The incidence as well as the severity of the clinical apnoea is greatest in infants born at earlier gestational ages. It might be expected that infants born at the lowest gestation would benefit most from treatment. No study evaluated this as part of the initial stated aim, therefore, this prespecified subgroup analysis could not be done. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1985</LINK>), <I>post-hoc</I> analysis showed that eight of the eleven control infants who required mechanical ventilation were born at less than 31 weeks gestation.</P>

<P>A major concern is the small numbers in each of five studies which, while adequate to show the large effect on apnoea, would not be able to detect less common adverse effects. The larger <LINK REF="STD-CAP-Trial-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP Trial 2006</LINK> did not report apnoea outcomes, but reported side effects and long term growth and development up to 18 to 21 months of age. These results include a large number of very low birth weight infants (caffeine group 1006, placebo group 1000) with any one of the three indications for trial entry (prophylaxis prevention of apnoea in 22%, treatment of apnoea in 40% or prophylaxis for extubation in 38%). Now that the authors have published outcomes by reason for trial entry, data from this trial could now be included. The authors highlight that the results of this <I>post hoc</I> subgroup analysis of the CAP trial must be treated with caution for reasons including that the original study was not stratified for clinical indication and that sample size calculations were not undertaken for these subgroups.</P>

<P>Although methylxanthines lead to a reduction of apnoea in preterm infants who have this clinical problem, they are not effective when given as prophylaxis to spontaneously breathing preterm infants at risk of developing apnoea/bradycardia because of their low gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2008</LINK>). Another review indicates that methylxanthines may be effective in facilitating extubation from IPPV in some infants and that this is partly due to a reduction in postextubation apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Methylxanthines are effective in reducing the number of apnoeic attacks in the short term and in reducing the use of mechanical ventilation. Caffeine has also been demonstrated to improve long term growth and neurodevelopment outcomes. In view of its lower acute toxicity (tachycardia or feed intolerance), caffeine would be the preferred drug.<BR/>

<P>In order to indicate which infants are likely to benefit from treatment, there is a need for stratification by gestation and/or other risk factors in future studies. In any future studies the longer term effects of treatment on growth and development should be evaluated. The dosage level of caffeine should be evaluated in research.</P>

<P>The overall report of the CAP trial contained 2006 infants with birth weights of 500 to 1250 g who were given caffeine in the first 10 days of life either as prophylactic therapy to prevent apnoea, treatment of recurrent apnoea or to facilitate extubation. In this report there are subgroups of infants for treatment of apnoea, prevention of apnoea and facilitation of extubation. In this review only data on infants treated for apnoea (Davis PG 2010) are included.</P>
