<P>Dexamethasone may help babies at high risk of complications when being taken off mechanical breathing support. The tube that is placed in the baby's airway to enable mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing) can cause injury. This can lead to complications when the tube is removed (extubation). This review found that giving dexamethasone (a corticosteroid drug) around the time of extubation can help prevent swelling in the baby's throat that might require reinsertion of the tube. However, the review found that there are adverse effects of dexamethasone. The benefits only outweigh the risks for babies at high risk of complication (such as those who have received several, or prolonged, intubations).</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Endotracheal tubes are foreign bodies that may injure the upper airway causing laryngeal edema. This in turn may result in failure of extubation in preterm infants. Corticosteroids have been used prophylactically to reduce upper airway obstruction and facilitate extubation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of intravenous corticosteroids on the incidence of endotracheal reintubation, stridor, atelectasis and adverse side effects in newborn infants having their endotracheal tube removed following a period of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) (dexamethasone and extub*), MEDLINE (MeSH search terms "dexamethasone", "extubat*" and "exp infant, newborn"), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts of conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching mainly in the English language. These searches were updated in August 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials were included that used random or quasi-random patient allocation and compared intravenous steroids given immediately prior to a planned extubation with placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by the two authors and analysed in RevMan for all trials. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed to examine differences in response between infants at high risk for upper airway edema and those receiving routine prophylaxis prior to extubation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Administration of dexamethasone prior to extubation significantly reduced the need for reintubation of the trachea. This result applies to both the high-risk group and to the total population of infants enrolled. However, the incidence of extubation failure was zero in the trial that attempted to exclude infants at high risk of airway edema. The side effects of higher blood sugar levels and glycosuria were found in the two trials where these were sought.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Implications for practice<BR/>Dexamethasone reduces the need for endotracheal reintubation of neonates after a period of IPPV. In view of the lack of effect in low-risk infants and the documented and potential side effects, it appears reasonable to restrict its use to infants at increased risk for airway edema and obstruction, such as those who have received repeated or prolonged intubations.</P>
<P>Implications for research<BR/>Issues of dosage and applicability to the extremely low birthweight population could be addressed in future trials. Outcomes such as chronic lung disease, duration of assisted ventilation and length of hospital stay as well as long-term neurodevelopment should also be examined. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Endotracheal intubation is used to provide intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for a number of neonatal conditions. The presence of a foreign body in contact with delicate upper airway mucosa can lead to injury. This may take the form of laryngeal oedema, vocal cord injury or subglottic stenosis, all of which may present clinically as upper airway obstruction after extubation (Arensman, 1988). This may in turn lead to increasing respiratory distress requiring reintubation of the trachea. Factors that may increase the likelihood of damage include repeated passage of an endotracheal tube, prolonged intubation and the presence of a large tube relative to the size of the glottis. Various agents including systemic corticosteroids have been used both prophylactically and as treatment to reduce upper airway obstruction and facilitate extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Carlo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlo 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, corticosteroids may also have a beneficial effect on the lower airways by decreasing oedema and secretions due to the toxic effects of oxygen and IPPV. Increased compliance of the lung has been observed following corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Durand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durand 1995</LINK>). A reduction of respiratory distress and consequent pressure gradients across the upper airway may decrease the tendency towards upper airway narrowing during extubation.</P>
<P>Systemic corticosteroids are not without side-effects. <LINK REF="REF-Halliday-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 2003</LINK> reported increased rates of short-term (hyperglycemia and hypertension) and long-term (neurological abnormalities including cerebral palsy) adverse effects in infants treated with early corticosteroids to prevent chronic lung disease.</P>
<P>This review updates the existing review of intravenous dexamethasone in neonates being extubated which was published in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1999</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether the use of intravenous corticosteroids improves the post-extubation course of newborn infants as evidenced by effects on the incidence of endotracheal reintubation, stridor, atelectasis and adverse side effects. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine whether there was a difference in response between the group of newborn infants as a whole and those thought to be at high risk of upper airway obstruction because of prolonged intubation or traumatic or multiple intubations. Sensitivity analysis was planned to investigate the role of potential confounding variables such as the use of nasal CPAP post-extubation.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007) dexamethasone and extub*), MEDLINE (1966 - August 2007, MeSH search terms "dexamethasone", "extubat*" and "exp infant, newborn"), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts of conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal handsearching mainly in the English language.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials:<BR/>The standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by the second author blinded to trial authors and institutions. Methodological quality assessment was based on 1) blinding of randomisation, 2) blinding of intervention, 3) completeness of follow-up and 4) blinding of outcome measurement. </P>
<P>Methods used to collect data from the included trials:<BR/>Each review author extracted data separately before comparison and resolution of differences. </P>
<P>Methods used to synthesize data:<BR/>Standard method of the Neonatal Review Group with the use of relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT). Heterogeneity was examined using the I squared test. </P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was performed to determine whether there was a difference in response between the group of newborn infants as a whole and those thought to be at high risk of upper airway obstruction because of prolonged intubation or traumatic or multiple intubations. Sensitivity analysis was planned to investigate the role of potential confounding variables such as the use of nasal CPAP post-extubation.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three randomized trials were identified which addressed the effects of treatment with dexamethasone to facilitate extubation of newborn infants following a period of IPPV. A full description of each is included in the Table, Characteristics of Included Studies. No trials were excluded from the review and no ongoing trials were identified.</P>
<P>The participants in the three trials differed with respect to risk of airway edema. <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> selected a population considered at high risk because of either traumatic or multiple intubations or intubation for more than 14 days. This group had a mean weight at entry of around 1200g. <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> specifically excluded patients intubated more than once and enrolled infants with a mean duration of intubation of less than a week. His patients comprised a heavier (mean &gt; 2kg) and more mature (mean &gt; 33 weeks) population. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> also studied a heavier (mean extubation weight 2200 - 2400g), more mature population (mean 32 - 34 weeks gestational age). There was no effort to include or exclude infants on the basis of perceived risk of airway edema although an upper limit of 30 days of intubation was placed to minimise the effect of subglottic stenosis.</P>
<P>All three trials used dexamethasone intravenously. <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> used three doses of 0.5 mg/kg, <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> 3 doses of 0.25mg/kg and <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> used a single dose of 0.25 mg. </P>
<P>The primary outcome, need for endotracheal intubation, was assessed in all trials. The presence of stridor was noted by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and Ferrara 1990 and atelectasis on CXR reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>. Side effects of dexamethasone including hypertension and hyperglycemia were evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All the trials are of high quality and full details are provided in the Table, Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>Method of subject allocation:<BR/>All three included studies were randomized controlled trials. Only <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> specified the use of a random number table and this trial and <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> used off site randomization. </P>
<P>Masking of caregivers:<BR/>The use of a normal saline placebo ensured caregivers were unaware of group of assignment. In view of the systemic side effects it is possible that the actual treatment group could have been suspected in some cases.</P>
<P>Completeness of outcome assessment:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> had complete follow-up of all randomized infants for all outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> excluded nine randomized infants from studies of pulmonary mechanics. However, all were included for the clinically important outcomes of endotracheal reintubation and atelectasis.</P>
<P>Masking of outcome assessors:<BR/>Masking of outcome assessment was achieved in all trials.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>There was no disagreement between reviewers with respect to quality assessment done independently. After discussion, there was also no disagreement regarding data extraction.</P>
<P>
<B>PRIMARY OUTCOME<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>ENDOTRACHEAL REINTUBATION (OUTCOMES 01.01, 02.01):<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>For the population as a whole, dexamethasone prior to extubation reduced the use of endotracheal reintubation [typical RR 0.18 (0.04, 0.97), typical RD -0.09 (-0.16, -0.01)]. Since number needed to treat (NNT) is the inverse of RD, on average twelve infants would need to be treated to prevent 1 reintubation, although confidence intervals are wide [NNT 12 (6, 100)]. In the subset of those thought to be at high risk of upper airway edema, a trend favouring dexamethasone did not reach statistical significance (confidence intervals surrounding RR include 1). However the RD does reach significance [RD -0.17 (-0.034, -0.004)] and on average six high-risk infants need to be treated to prevent one reintubation, with very wide confidence intervals [NNT 6 (3, 250)].</P>
<P>The drug is not without side-effects and defining the group of infants in whom it is most likely to be effective is desirable. The trial in which infants with one risk factor for upper airway edema (multiple intubations) were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK>) had a reintubation rate in the total study population of 0 of 59 infants. The overall treatment effect is therefore derived from the high-risk population of <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and the population including all intubated infants of <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>. </P>
<P>
<B>SECONDARY OUTCOMES</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>POST EXTUBATION STRIDOR (OUTCOMES 01.02, 02.02, 03.01, 04.01):<BR/>
</B>Dexamethasone was also effective in reducing the incidence of postextubation stridor [typical RR 0.39 (0.16,0.93), typical RD -0.17 (-0.31, -0.03), NNT 6 (3, 37)]. This result is heavily influenced by the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK>. <I>Post hoc</I> analysis on the basis of the dose of dexamethasone administered shows that while the multiple dose strategy of Couser reduced the incidence of stridor, the single dose regime of <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> did not. <BR/>The long-term outcome of subglottic stenosis was reported only by Couser and the low incidence of this complication means caution should be exercised in interpreting the trend favouring dexamethasone (<B>Outcome 01.05</B>).</P>
<P>
<B>POST EXTUBATION ATELECTASIS (OUTCOME 01.03):</B>
<BR/>A trend exists towards a reduction in the rate of postextubation atelectasis with dexamethasone but once again the low risk population of <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> recorded no cases of this adverse outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>GLYCOSURIA (OUTCOME 01.04):</B>
<BR/>Glycosuria occurred only in infants treated with dexamethasone (7 of 27) in the only trial evaluating this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK>). Using the measure of RD, this finding is statistically significant [typical RD 0.26 (0.08,0.44)] and the number needed to treat to produce this harm is 4 (2, 13). Bedside monitoring also showed a statistically significantly higher glucose level in the dexamethasone group (<LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>). The clinical importance of these findings is not fully examined. In each of the two trials recording blood pressure as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>), the authors reported no differences between groups. No details are presented to allow meta-analysis of this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>OTHER OUTCOMES:</B>
<BR/>Two studies recorded pulmonary function tests before and after extubation. <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> demonstrated significant differences between dexamethasone and placebo groups with respect to total respiratory resistance, dynamic compliance and tidal volumes, all favouring dexamethasone. In the lower risk population of <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK>, no such differences were found. <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> also reported pCO2 values postextubation that were statistically lower in the dexamethasone group. The absolute difference of 5 mm Hg was of limited clinical importance.</P>
<P>An <I>a priori</I> subgroup analysis was planned to examine the confounding variable, use of postextubation NCPAP. This was unable to be performed as the two trials in which this cointervention was used (<LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK>) did so on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis and did not report outcomes related to NCPAP administration.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The outcome, requirement for endotracheal reintubation, is of modest clinical importance in the spectrum of those relating to neonatal intensive care. In addition to its implications of instability for the infant, reintubation has economic consequences, the presence of an endotracheal tube significantly increasing the cost of intensive care. Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with many effects beyond reducing airway edema. The disturbance to glucose metabolism is well demonstrated by two of the included studies. In combination, these facts suggest that it is important to define both a group at low risk of requiring reintubation, in whom dexamethasone may not be justified and a high-risk group that will benefit from administration of the drug before extubation. </P>
<P>Description of the study populations of <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> does not allow definition of their risk factors as outlined by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK>. However, it is likely that the latter study included a population at substantially higher risk of requiring reintubation compared with the other two. In a high-risk population, the equation of treating six infants with dexamethasone in order to prevent one reintubation seems to favour treatment. The absence of infants requiring reintubation in the <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> trial in larger infants having had only one endotracheal tube suggests treatment is not indicated in this group. Interestingly, in a randomized trial of the routine use of dexamethasone prior to extubation in older children (Tellez 1991), no benefit could be demonstrated.</P>
<P>Since we regard the avoidance of intubation and other pulmonary benefits as having greater clinical importance than glycosuria, we believe the use of dexamethasone can be justified for infants at high risk of upper-airway edema and obstruction after extubation.<BR/> <BR/>Some uncertainty exists about the clinical importance of the benefit attributed to dexamethasone by the limited time of follow-up reported by these studies. The need for reintubation beyond 24 hours after ETT removal is not reported. It is possible that the benefits of dexamethasone derive, at least in part, from the improvements in pulmonary compliance demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK>, an effect that may have diminished over a longer period. Longer courses of corticosteroids to reduce chronic lung disease were linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 2003</LINK>). No trials of short-course corticosteroids for extubation have followed up infants after discharge and long-term safety remains undetermined.</P>
<P>An additional limitation of this review results from the changes in neonatal intensive care since these studies were performed. The use of exogenous surfactant, increased use of antenatal steroids and the trend to extubate early to NCPAP have reduced the duration of endotracheal intubation. In addition, an increasing number of survivors at 22 to 24 weeks forms a new population in whom this treatment may have a different safety/efficacy profile.</P>
<P>Two dosage regimens were used by trials in this review. Meaningful comparison is only possible with respect to the outcome of stridor. An apparent advantage of the higher, multiple dose strategy requires further investigation.</P>
<P>Epinephrine has been used topically to reduce airway oedema and to facilitate extubation and is the subject of another systematic review (Davies,1998).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Dexamethasone reduces the need for endotracheal reintubation of neonates after a period of IPPV. In view of the lack of effect in low-risk infants and the documented and potential side effects, it appears reasonable to restrict its use to infants at increased risk for airway edema and obstruction, such as those who have received repeated or prolonged intubations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Issues of dosage and applicability to the extremely low birthweight population should be evaluated. Outcomes such as chronic lung disease, duration of assisted ventilation and length of hospital stay as well as long-term neurodevelopment should also be examined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
