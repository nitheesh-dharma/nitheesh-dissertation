<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ear surgery, as surgery in general, can be divided into several categories: clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty surgery. Postoperative complications can include wound infection, discharge from the outer ear canal, labyrinthitis and graft failure. This review aimed to demonstrate whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery can be helpful in reducing postoperative complications in clean or clean-contaminated surgery. There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trials showing that there is any antibiotic substance, in any regime, which can contribute to reducing complications in any type of clean or clean-contaminated surgical procedure in the ear.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-22 12:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials.

<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised trials involving patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated types of ear surgery. Skull base surgery was excluded. We included any regimen of local and/or systemic antibiotic prophylaxis administered at or around the time of surgery compared to placebo, no antibiotic or an alternative intervention group. Outcome measures were infection, discharge, graft failure, labyrinthitis and adverse effects of prophylaxis.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-22 12:53:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Eleven studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was fair to good. However, most studies presented insufficient methodological detail.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 13:53:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in Issue 3, 2004 and previously updated in 2007.</P>
<P>Ear surgery may be performed in the treatment of a number of disorders including chronic otitis media (with or without cholesteatoma), ossicular chain disorders, tympanic membrane perforations and otitis media with effusion. Postoperative infection following ear surgery may result in:</P>
<UL>
<LI>wound infections;</LI>
<LI>infection of the middle ear or mastoid, resulting in discharge from the ear canal;</LI>
<LI>failure of the tympanic membrane to close; or</LI>
<LI>labyrinthitis due to infection in, or adjacent to, the inner ear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These complications may be associated with discomfort and inconvenience for the patient, an increase in morbidity and an increase in the costs of medical care.</P>
<P>Surgical procedures have conventionally been classified as clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1994</LINK>). A surgical operation is clean if there is no break in aseptic technique and the respiratory, gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts are not entered. Procedures entering the oropharynx, sterile genitourinary or biliary tract, the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts, or requiring a minor break in aseptic technique are considered to be clean-contaminated surgery. Contaminated surgery is defined as the presence of acute inflammation, infected bile or urine, or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract. When established infection exists, it is classified as dirty surgery.</P>
<P>The principles of prophylaxis against post-surgical infection were established in the laboratory in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1961</LINK>). The administration of antibiotics prior to surgery is now widely used in certain types of operations (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 1986</LINK>). Generally speaking, prophylaxis during clean operations without implantation of a foreign body is not recommended, due to the low incidence of postoperative infection (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1988</LINK>). Prophylaxis during clean-contaminated or infected surgery can be useful in reducing postoperative infection. It has been claimed that antibiotic prophylaxis during ear surgery reduces infection rates (<LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK>). As the pathogenesis of post-surgical infection after ear surgery is similar to any other type of clean, clean-contaminated or infected surgery, subgroup analysis is important with respect to bacterial contamination. Ear surgery and mode of contamination should be divided into the following distinct categories.</P>
<P>A. Any type of clean surgery. This includes all types of reconstructive tympanoplasties, such as myringoplasty, stapedotomy and stapedectomy. It also includes all types of canal wall up procedures in which the preoperative middle ear is not infected (i.e. a preoperative dry ear). Facial nerve decompression also falls into this category.</P>
<P>B. Any procedure in which preoperative discharge is present, i.e. a clean-contaminated or infected ear. This includes any type of surgery for chronic otitis media (with or without cholesteatoma).</P>
<P>C. The insertion of ventilating tubes for otitis media with effusion (glue ear). This category can be subdivided into ears with no glue (clean), seromucous glue (clean/clean-contaminated) and purulent glue (infected). The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in ventilation tube insertion will be considered in a separate review.</P>
<P>D. Any type of oto-neurosurgical procedure in which there is a large exposure or even a breach of the dura: vestibular nerve section, translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma removal, decompression of the endolymphatic sac, etc. These types of operations are not considered in this review.</P>
<P>The incidence of postoperative infections in these groups varies. Estimates have ranged from less than 5% in clean procedures to more than 10% in contaminated and dirty procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK>). This supports the idea that different types of surgery should be considered separately, with regard to the risk of bacterial contamination. Other authors, however, suggest that combining data from similar prophylactic regimens used during different otologic surgical procedures is appropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK>). Furthermore, there might be a difference in effectiveness between different antibiotic regimens, e.g. systemic or local antibiotics. A number of randomised controlled trials have compared the use of systemic antibiotic to the use of a placebo or no antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Bagger_x002d_Sjoback-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger-Sjoback 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eschelman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Eschelman 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-John-1988" TYPE="STUDY">John 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pirodda-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pirodda 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winerman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Winerman 1981</LINK>). Others have compared the use of systemic antibiotics together with local antibiotics to the use of a local antibiotic alone (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hester-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hester 1998</LINK>). Another study has compared the use of a local antibiotic alone to no antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antibiotics given during mastoidectomy for acute mastoiditis are not considered to be prophylactic but therapeutic. Any study addressing this issue was not included.</P>
<P>A number of descriptive reviews of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery have been published, in which some attempt has been made to assess methodological quality and include this in the interpretation of results (<LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK>). However, there is sufficient persisting uncertainty about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis during the surgical treatment of ear diseases to justify a systematic review of the evidence from randomised trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-10-22 12:58:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To determine whether the prophylactic administration of antibiotics in patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated otologic surgical procedures reduces the incidence of postoperative infection. This includes wound infections, any infection of the middle ear, mastoid or external ear itself, manifesting as postoperative discharge or inner ear infection (labyrinthitis).</P>
<P>The following hypotheses were tested:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the use of antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a reduction in the proportion of patients developing a postoperative infection, compared with those given a placebo, no prophylaxis, or an alternative antibiotic regime;</LI>
<LI>the use of antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a decrease in graft failure rates in patients undergoing any type of tympanic membrane or middle ear reconstruction.</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:05:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We grouped antimicrobial agents used for therapy and/or prophylaxis by their molecular class. Each molecular class was divided into subgroups by main antimicrobial activity against intraaural pathogens, thus every antibiotic substance occurred in exactly one subgroup. We classified regimes in terms of subgroups and combinations of subgroups.</P>
<P>We classified onset of administration as preoperative or perioperative (including intraoperative and postoperative). We classified dosage as prophylaxis within 24 hours and treatment for more than 24 hours, thus each arm of each controlled study referred to a specific regime/dosage pattern. We pooled all studies where the antibiotics under comparison were assigned to the same set of regime/dosage pattern.</P>
<P>We grouped the antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis by their way of administration, e.g. systemic, local or a combination of local and systemic, thus creating subgroups for the method of administration of the drug. If possible, we formed different subgroups for the type of surgical procedure, e.g. clean or clean-contaminated. This resulted, where possible, in six different comparisons (clean or clean-contaminated surgery; systemic antibiotics versus no antibiotics; systemic and local antibiotics versus local antibiotics; local antibiotics versus no antibiotics).</P>
<P>Tables of comparison included the following outcomes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Postoperative fever ( &gt; 37 °C (98 °F) for &#8805; five days).</LI>
<LI>Postoperative wound infections (discharge of pus or necessity for additional interventions).</LI>
<LI>Postoperative change of antibiotic treatment (regime and/or dosage).</LI>
<LI>Adverse drug effects (minor symptoms such as laboratory findings, rash).</LI>
<LI>Adverse drug effects (major symptoms such as clinical/laboratory signs of organ dysfunction).</LI>
<LI>Graft failure rates.</LI>
<LI>Closure of the tympanic membrane.</LI>
<LI>Bacterial eradication (comparison of intra- and postoperative cultures).</LI>
<LI>Death from any cause.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We summarised outcomes 1) to 3) as "Postoperative infection (Yes/No)"; outcomes 4 and 5 as "Adverse effects (Yes/No)"; outcomes 6 and 7 as "Graft failure (Yes/No)"; and listed outcomes 8 and 9 separately.</P>
<P>We determined summary odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel) and a random-effects model (Der Simonian and Laird).</P>
<P>We also determined the risk differences (RD) between different regime/dosage patterns (difference in the failure rate) and a 95% confidence interval. In the event of a statistically significant risk difference, we determined the number of patients needed to be treated in order to prevent one failure (NNT) for every comparison of regime/dosage pattern.</P>
<P>We reviewed a test of heterogeneity and an appraisal of individual study odds ratio within each comparison of regime/dosage pattern to determine if similar results were obtained from each study. Where significant heterogeneity existed, we examined the trials for specific potential clinical differences.</P>
<P>We assessed potential effects of publication bias on the results of the meta-analysis from a funnel graph of the sample size plotted against the odds ratio.</P>
<P>We planned to conduct subgroup analyses for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>children and adults (adults &#8805; 16 to 17);</LI>
<LI>surgical techniques: intraoperative and/or histological diagnosis: normal, inflamed, purulent;</LI>
<LI>preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative onset of administration;</LI>
<LI>duration of administration (single shot, repeated &#8804; 24 hours, repeated &gt; 24 hours); and</LI>
<LI>mode of administration.</LI>

<P>The most recent update search (August 2009) identified no new studies. From previous searches (June 2007) thirteen publications regarding the use of any regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. One study was presented as a randomised controlled trial, but appeared to be a case report (<LINK REF="STD-Leonard-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 1967</LINK>). One study compared two different antibiotic regimens, and was therefore not suitable for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1983</LINK>). Thus, we included 11 studies in the review.</P>
<P>We contacted authors, if possible. We asked questions about methodological issues and, when needed, we requested original data. Five authors responded. Details of the participants, interventions and outcomes in those studies are presented in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. As is presented in this table, the studies were very heterogeneous with regard to the chosen antibiotic and dosage, and onset and duration of administration. Therefore, pooling of results by different regime/dosage pattern was impossible. Assuming the choice for an antibiotic is a rational one, we decided to make no distinction between different regime/dosage patterns, and just refer to an antibiotic as being used or not.</P>
<P>Seven studies compared the use of systemic antibiotics to the use of a placebo or no antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Bagger_x002d_Sjoback-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger-Sjoback 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eschelman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Eschelman 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-John-1988" TYPE="STUDY">John 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pirodda-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pirodda 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winerman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Winerman 1981</LINK>). Three studies compared the use of systemic antibiotics together with local antibiotics to the use of a local antibiotic alone (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hester-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hester 1998</LINK>). Finally, only one study compared the use of a local antibiotic alone to no antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was not possible for the type of surgical procedure, e.g. clean or clean-contaminated, because most studies did not present their results in sufficient detail. Unfortunately, although the study authors were contacted, they could not provide us with more detailed results.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was also not possible for children and adults, because age was not assessed in sufficient detail in any study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bagger_x002d_Sjoback-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger-Sjoback 1987</LINK> focused on different clean and clean-contaminated procedures, such as myringoplasties, stapedectomies and radical mastoidectomies (91 patients). The antibiotic used was phenoxymethylpenicillin. Both the antibiotic and placebo group received hydrocortisone soaked gauze in the outer ear canal after surgery. The most important outcome measure was postoperative infection one week after surgery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1966</LINK> focused on different types of myringoplasties (96 patients). The antibiotic used was sulfamethoxazole. After surgery, both antibiotic and placebo group received polymyxin/neomycin/hydrocortisone soaked sponges in the outer ear canal. The outcome measures were postoperative infection after ten days and after six weeks, closure of the tympanic membrane, and (mild) adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eschelman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Eschelman 1971</LINK> designed a three-arm trial. The authors used two different antibiotics, penicillin and ampicillin, compared to a placebo. Three different groups of patients were identified: 1) tympanomastoidectomies with cholesteatomas; 2) tympanoplasties and tympanomastoidectomies without cholesteatomas; and 3) stapedectomies and exploratory tympanotomies. The outcome measure was postoperative infection. A total of 107 patients were enrolled.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Govaerts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Govaerts 1998</LINK> presented a large study (750 patients were enrolled). Different procedures were carried out, such as tympanoplasties and radical mastoidectomies. The antibiotic used was cefuroxime. The most important outcome measure was postoperative infection within two weeks after surgery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hester-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hester 1998</LINK> used different antibiotics in a two-arm trial, depending on the specific need of the patients (ampicillin/sulbactam/amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin/cefalexin, erythromycin or clindamycin). Both antibiotic and placebo group received neomycin/polymyxin/hydrocortisone otic drops during the period following surgery. All procedures were tympanoplasties, tympanomastoidectomies or radical mastoidectomies. The outcome measures were graft failure within three weeks after surgery and after six months, and postoperative infection within three weeks after surgery. A total of 146 patients were enrolled in this study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK> presented the largest study on this subject. He enrolled 3481 patients who underwent a broad variety of procedures, including some neurotological procedures. The antibiotics used were cephalotin and cefazolin. Unfortunately, he did not present subgroup analyses. Therefore, the only outcome measure suitable for this review was graft failure after three weeks of surgery. In 2136 of the 3481 patients a graft was used.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-John-1988" TYPE="STUDY">John 1988</LINK> investigated a total of 130 myringoplasties. The antibiotic used was a combination of ampicillin and flucloxacillin. The outcome measure was 'success', defined as closure of the tympanic membrane after eight weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1986</LINK> focused on patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media, who had positive pre-operative cultures for <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (26 patients). The antibiotic used was ceftazidime. The outcome measures were dryness of the outer ear canal postoperatively and after two months, and graft failure after two months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pirodda-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pirodda 1994</LINK> enrolled 100 patients in the study, who underwent myringoplasties, tympanoplasties or tympanomastoidectomies. Ceftriaxone was the antibiotic used. After one week, one month and two months, the status of the following outcome measures were assessed: 1) retro-auricular incision; 2) outer ear canal; 3) tympanic membrane; and 4) mastoid cavity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2002</LINK> was the only study which used only a local antibiotic (ofloxacin otic drops). In a three-arm trial, two different dosages of otic drops were compared with each other and with a third group which received no antibiotic treatment. All 101 patients underwent tympanoplasties. The outcome measure was 'success', defined as closing of the tympanic membrane after eight weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Winerman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Winerman 1981</LINK> investigated a study population of 72 patients who all underwent closed cavity procedures. In the antibiotic group, 30 patients received clindamycin and gentamycin. Six patients received only clindamycin because preoperative cultures showed no need for the use of gentamycin. The most important outcome measure was the occurrence of infectious complications within three months after surgery, which was not specifically defined.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-10-22 13:20:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The two authors initially agreed on about 90% of the assessments of methodological quality. All disagreements were dissolved by discussion. We designed a criteria list with validity items to score the methodological quality of the studies. We used a standard form for evaluating randomised controlled trials, made by the Evidence-Based Guideline Development (EBRO) for this purpose (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> presents the scores on these validity items of the criteria list. The methodological quality of the included studies was fair to good. Many studies reported on randomised treatment allocation, but (a) failed to describe the exact procedure or (b) whether concealed allocation had been performed. Information on blinding the outcome assessor (e) was often not provided. Also the information on blinding of patients (c) and physician (d), and about loss to follow up (g) was often not provided. Although only two studies scored positive on all items of the criteria list, none of the studies were considered to contain 'fatal flaws'.</P>
<P>With regard to specific studies, we can mention the following.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bagger_x002d_Sjoback-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger-Sjoback 1987</LINK> was a well-designed and performed study. However, the authors withdrew four patients and addressed them as being lost to follow up. These patients developed clinical signs of infection and were withdrawn for proper treatment. These patients should, in fact, have been taken along in further analyses. In our analysis, we followed a 'worst-case scenario'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1966</LINK> offered very little information on methodological procedures. Moreover, the authors reported some patients not to be seen on every visit during follow up. Unfortunately they did not report to which arm of the trial these patients belonged. In our analyses, we followed a 'worst case scenario', assuming these patients were in the control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-John-1988" TYPE="STUDY">John 1988</LINK> used a questionable method of randomising patients: by flipping a coin. Moreover, the 110 patients were not equally divided (treatment:control rate was 55:75). After contacting them, the authors assured us that this was merely coincidence, and that the tossing of the coin had proven this to be an adequate method of randomisation.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-10-22 13:21:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>It appeared to be impossible to present subgroup analyses for children and adults, surgical techniques, intra-operative and/or histological diagnosis, onset of administration and duration of administration of the drug. The data in the studies were not presented in sufficient detail to make this possible. Subgroup analyses for different ways of administrating the drug, e.g. systemic or local, was possible.</P>
<P>Pooling of data was possible. However, it should be taken into consideration that most studies did not present subgroup analyses for specific procedures, or for the distinction between clean and clean-contaminated procedures. Moreover, in some studies, outcome measures were not specified. Still, we believe that pooling of these data is appropriate.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-22 13:21:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This review included 11 randomised controlled trials comparing a certain antibiotic in a certain regime/dosage pattern with a control group. These patterns were investigated during different otologic surgical procedures (clean as well as contaminated types of surgery). Often no subgroup analysis was presented with regard to type of surgery, e.g. clean or clean-contaminated. This is also the reason why, unfortunately, we could not perform any sub-analysis with regard to type of surgery. This is specifically the case in <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1988</LINK>. This well-designed and performed study investigated 3481 patients and included some procedures which we did not investigate. The authors' most important conclusion, however, is that there is no need at all for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery in terms of reducing postoperative complications such as infection and graft failure. We have, however, been able to assess subgroup analyses with regard to the method of administration of the antibiotic, e.g. systemic and/or local.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies, scored by the use of a list of validity criteria, was fair to good. Often insufficient detail was given on methodological procedures. This could, of course, enhance bias. Nevertheless, it was the authors' opinion that none of the included studies contained fatal flaws.</P>
<P>Many studies differed in the definition of certain outcome measures, or did not define them at all. This made the pooling of results difficult. However, the authors believed that the character of the subject of this review allows more differences in defining these measures than other subjects, therefore allowing the pooling of results. One has to realise, however, that when we pooled results to evaluate an effect within three weeks, some studies had an evaluation after two weeks, while another study could have evaluated after two and a half weeks.</P>
<P>None of the trials in itself showed any significant difference in any of their outcome measures, independent of the quality of the study. Pooling of results did not change any of those views. Therefore, on the basis of the data available, there seems no significant contribution for antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery, in term of reduction of postoperative complications such as infection and graft failure.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-22 13:22:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics in clean or clean-contaminated ear surgery, in any regimen, is helpful in reducing postoperative complications such as wound infection, discharge from the outer ear canal, labyrinthitis and graft failure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-22 13:22:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>More than ten different studies all concluded that there is no need for antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated ear surgery. This review supports this conclusion. Therefore, there seems to be no need for an additional randomised controlled trial on this subject. However, there has never been a large study focusing on either clean or clean-contaminated procedures alone. Taking into account the fact that there might be a difference in <I>a priori</I> risk of postoperative infection between clean and clean-contaminated procedures, a large study focusing merely on clean or clean-contaminated ear surgery, could be beneficial. Furthermore, a study focusing on different populations of patients, e.g. the elderly or children, could be interesting. It should also be noted that when the low incidence of postoperative infections is taken into consideration, for a new randomised controlled trial to have enough statistical power it would have to include a very large number of patients.</P>
