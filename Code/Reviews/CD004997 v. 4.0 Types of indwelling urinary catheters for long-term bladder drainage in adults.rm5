<P>Prolonged urinary catheterization is common amongst people in long-term care settings, for example in nursing homes or home care. In addition, many people living in the community need to have a permanent catheter. Long-term catheterization was defined as for more than 30 days. We identified only three trials involving 102 adults in various settings. All three trials were too small to provide reliable evidence to indicate which types of catheters are best to use in which patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-12-01 12:17:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prolonged urinary catheterization is common amongst people in long-term care settings and this carries a high risk of developing a catheter-related urinary tract infection and associated complications. A variety of different kinds of urethral catheters are available. Some have been developed specifically to lower the risk of catheter-associated infection, for example antiseptic or antibiotic impregnated catheters. Ease of use, comfort and handling for the caregivers and patients, and cost-effectiveness are also important factors influencing choice.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:14:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials were included, involving 102 adults in various settings. Two trials had a parallel group design and one was a randomised cross-over trial.</P>
<P>Only two of the six targeted comparisons were assessed by these trials: antiseptic impregnated catheters versus standard catheters (one trial) and one type of standard catheter versus another standard catheter (two trials).</P>
<P>The single small cross-over trial was inadequate to assess the value of silver alloy (antiseptic) impregnated catheters. In the two trials comparing different types of standard catheters, estimates of differences were all imprecise because the trials also had small sample sizes; confidence intervals (CI) were too wide to rule out clinically important differences. One trial did suggest, however, that the use of a hydrogel coated latex catheter rather than a silicone catheter may be better tolerated (risk ratio (RR) for need for early removal 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.77).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:14:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The updated search could not reveal any additional evidence. Very few trials have compared different types of catheter for long-term bladder drainage. All trials were small and showed methodological weaknesses. Therefore, the evidence was not sufficient as a reliable basis for practical conclusions. Further, better quality trials are needed to address the current lack of evidence in this clinically important area.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:15:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:15:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prolonged urinary catheterization is most common amongst people in long-term care settings, for example nursing homes or home care. Common reasons are urinary incontinence and urinary retention (physical or neurogenic), which may have a specific underlying cause such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, enlarged prostate, or for wound-management and patient comfort (<LINK REF="REF-Gammack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gammack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilde-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 1986</LINK>). In the USA 4% to 15% of long-term care residents have used urinary catheters for more than 30 days (<LINK REF="REF-Gammack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gammack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 1990</LINK>). Hospital wide prevalence rates for indwelling catheterization were reported to range from 25% to 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:15:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The urinary tract is the most common site (30% to 40%) of nosocomial infections and this infection is almost always associated with indwelling urinary catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Gastmeier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gastmeier 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NINSS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNIS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNIS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RKI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RKI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tenke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenke 2008</LINK>). Two recent prevalence studies on nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) show that 63% to 74% of nosocomial UTIs were catheter associated (<LINK REF="REF-Bjerklund-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjerklund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bouza-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouza 2001</LINK>). The incidence for catheter-associated bacteriuria is about 3% to 10% per day that a catheter is in situ. Therefore, most users of catheters will have a detectable bacteriuria within 30 days (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1997</LINK>). The most common definition of urinary tract infection is bacteriuria with 10<SUP>5</SUP> or more colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml) (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RKI-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RKI 2011</LINK>) together with symptoms such as fever. Catheter-related infection is more common in women, the elderly and patients with co-morbidities (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>An estimated two-thirds of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients are extraluminal (bacteria ascending from the meatus along the catheter urethral interface), and one third are intraluminal (bacteria migrating into the catheter lumen as a result of disconnecting the catheter system) (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tambyah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambyah 1999</LINK>). The micro-organism species that are responsible vary widely between and within hospitals. <I>Escherichia coli</I> remains the most common, and other important organisms are <I>Enterococci</I>, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, <I>Klebsiella spp.</I> and <I>Candida spp.</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NINSS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RKI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RKI 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most frequent complications associated with chronic catheterization are symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria, encrustation, irritation of the urethra tissue and leaking of urine due to blockage of the catheter itself. Less common are bacteraemia and renal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:15:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indwelling urinary catheters are of varying design and materials. The most common, standard catheters include polyvinyl chlorine (PVC), plain latex, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and, particularly for long-term use, silicone-elastomer, hydrogel, polymer hydromer and pure silicone (<LINK REF="REF-CF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomfret-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomfret 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>). Catheters may be impregnated with antiseptic or antibiotic agents; the most common bactericidal agent is silver (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:15:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review investigates which type of indwelling urinary catheter minimises the catheter-associated infection rate and related complications during long-term catheterization in adults. Other factors that may influence the choice of catheter are also examined. These include ease of use, comfort and handling for the caregivers and patients, and cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>Results from the search were independently assessed for potential eligibility by two people and disagreement was resolved by discussion with a third review author. Potentially relevant studies were retrieved in full and two review authors decided independently whether they met the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was again resolved by a third review author. Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised by two review authors using a data extraction sheet.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-07 10:14:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies that met the selection criteria were assessed for methodological quality. The system for classifying the methodological quality of controlled trials is based on an assessment of the three principal potential sources of bias. These are:<BR/>(1) selection bias from insecure random allocation of treatments;<BR/>(2) attrition bias from dropouts or losses to follow-up, particularly if there is a differential dropout rate between groups;<BR/>(3) biased ascertainment (detection bias) of outcome, where knowledge of the allocation might have influenced the measurement of outcome.</P>

<P>Data extraction was undertaken by two review authors (KB and PJ) independently and simultaneously. Any disagreement was resolved by a third review author (GL).</P>
<P>The included trial data were handled according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Undertaking a meta-analysis was not appropriate because the interventions were not comparable. Data from cross-over trials were presented in 'Other data' tables. Cross-over studies were indicated by the suffix '*'. Comparisons were categorised by type of intervention catheter. Categorical outcomes were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data were presented using weighted mean difference (WMD). If quantitative synthesis was appropriate, the pooled relative risks, weighted mean differences, and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) would have been calculated using a fixed-effect model.

<P>For our updated review we could not retrieve additional evidence despite very extensive searching, including the assessment of over 11,000 abstracts and consideration of 18 full text papers.

There were no trials of antibiotic impregnated catheters, whether compared with standard urethral catheters or antiseptic impregnated catheters. No trials compared different types of antiseptic or antibiotic impregnated urethral catheters with each other. Only one out of three included trials described a method of concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antiseptic impregnated urethral catheters versus standard urethral catheters</HEADING>
<P>There have been claims that silver alloyed catheters may decrease complications and increase patient comfort. Furthermore, another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Schumm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumm 2008</LINK>) evaluating catheters used in the short-term indicated that silver alloyed catheters reduced bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI compared to standard catheters.</P>
<P>Only one small cross-over RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Nakada-1996_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Nakada 1996*</LINK>) with 12 patients evaluated silver alloyed (silver and hydrogel coated) Foley catheters compared with silicone coated catheters. The trial was too small to assess differences in outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">One type of standard urethral catheter versus another</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included two trials involving 90 adults who were randomized to different types of standard catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bull-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1991</LINK>). There were significant clinical differences between the trials regarding the types of standard catheters and outcome measurements. Therefore, the data from these trials were not statistically combined. Both trials were small and the data were insufficient to draw conclusions. The only finding of statistical significance was that the hydrogel coated latex catheter was retained for a longer time in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1991</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the included trials was low to moderate. Blinding of the treatment condition was not possible because of the type of intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Bull-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1991</LINK> reported imbalance in follow-up. Only one patient in the hydrophilic polymer coated latex catheter group discontinued due to catheter-related problems compared to seven patients within the silicone coated urethral catheter group. However, patients characteristics regarding pre-study UTIs were not balanced and were higher in the silicone coated urethral catheter group.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main finding of this updated review is the continuing lack of evidence for this clinically highly relevant problem. Generally, the three included trials were very small and showed methodological weaknesses. The evidence was not sufficient as a reliable basis for practice and should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-05 15:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger, well powered, better quality randomised trials with robust concealed randomisation methods are needed. Further research is needed to establish evidence based practice for long-term catheter care. The following issues should be addressed to determine the effect of the type of indwelling urethral catheter on the occurrence of UTI and other important outcomes in adults with long-term voiding problems:<BR/>1. at risk groups, particularly women;<BR/>2. long-term care settings, e.g. home care, nursing homes;<BR/>3. UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria;<BR/>4. use of antibiotics;<BR/>5. patients' comfort, satisfaction and quality of life;<BR/>6. practitioners' satisfaction;<BR/>7. economic evaluation.</P>
<P>The types of catheters compared should include standard, antibiotic impregnated and antiseptic impregnated catheters used for continuous urethral drainage.</P>
