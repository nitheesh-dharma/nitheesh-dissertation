<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Percutaneous pinning for treating distal radial fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In older people, a 'broken wrist' (from a fracture at the lower end of one of the two forearm bones) can result from a fall onto an outstretched hand. Treatment usually involves reduction (putting the broken bone back into position) and immobilising the wrist in a plaster cast. Surgery may be considered for more seriously displaced fractures. One type of surgery is percutaneous pinning. This involves the insertion of pins through the skin (percutaneous) to hold the bones in a proper position while they heal. In most pinning methods, wires are placed across the fracture and used to fix the fragments together. In Kapandji pinning, the wires are placed to support the distal (lower end) fragment. This review looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials testing the use of percutaneous pinning or comparing different aspects of percutaneous pinning.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials, involving 940 generally older adults with potentially or evidently unstable fractures, were included. Because of weak methodology such as using inadequate methods of randomisation and outcome assessment, the possibility of serious bias cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>Six trials compared percutaneous pinning with plaster cast immobilisation. Pinning involving across-fracture fixation, used in five of these trials, improved anatomical outcome; and in three trials it appeared to improve function too. The complications associated with across-fracture fixation were generally minor. Kapandji pinning, used in the remaining trial, was associated with an excess of complications compared with conservative treatment. Three other trials compared different methods of pinning. Two of these found some evidence of an increased complication rate with Kapandji pinning compared with across-fracture methods. Two trials using two very different pinning techniques compared biodegradable (dissolvable) pins or wires versus metal pins or wires. Both trials found a significant excess of complications associated with the use of the biodegradable material. Two trials compared plaster cast immobilisation for one week versus for six weeks after surgery. One of these trials found the duration of immobilisation after across-fracture pinning did not have a significant effect on outcome. In contrast, more complications occurred in the early mobilisation group after Kapandji pinning in the other trial.</P>
<P>The review concluded that there is some evidence to support the use of percutaneous pinning. However, the precise role and methods of percutaneous pinning are not established. The higher rates of complications with Kapandji pinning and biodegradable materials casts some doubt on their general use.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem. A key method of surgical fixation is percutaneous pinning, involving the insertion of wires through the skin to stabilise the fracture.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of percutaneous pinning for fractures of the distal radius in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials involving adults with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared percutaneous pinning with conservative treatment, or different aspects of percutaneous pinning.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed and extracted data from the included trials. Some pooling of data was undertaken for one comparison.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen trials, involving 940 generally older adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included. Methodological weaknesses among these trials included lack of allocation concealment and inadequate outcome assessment. Factors affecting the applicability of trial evidence included inconsistent fracture classification, variations in outcome assessment and incomplete reporting.</P>
<P>Six heterogeneous trials compared percutaneous pinning with plaster cast immobilisation. Across-fracture pinning, used in five trials, was associated with improved anatomical outcome and generally minor complications. There was some indication of similar or improved function in the pinning group. One quasi-randomised trial found an excess of complications after Kapandji pinning.</P>
<P>Three trials compared different methods of pinning. Two trials found a higher incidence of complications after Kapandji fixation compared with two methods of across-fracture fixation. The third trial provided inadequate evidence for modified Kapandji fixation versus Willenegger fixation.</P>
<P>Two small trials comparing biodegradable pins versus metal pins found a significant excess of complications associated with biodegradable material.</P>
<P>Two small trials compared plaster cast immobilisation for one week versus for six weeks after surgery. One trial found duration of immobilisation after trans-styloid fixation did not have a significant effect on outcome. More complications occurred in the early mobilisation group after Kapandji pinning in the second trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Though there is some evidence to support its use, the precise role and methods of percutaneous pinning are not established. The higher rates of complications with Kapandji pinning and biodegradable materials casts some doubt on their general use.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Note:</B> This is one of five reviews that will cover all surgical interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults. Each review will provide updated evidence for one of the several surgical categories that were presented together in the previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). Following publication of the five reviews, <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK> will be republished as an 'umbrella' review summarising the evidence for surgical treatment for these fractures.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of the condition: distal radial fracture in adults</B>
<BR/>Fractures of the distal radius, often referred to as "wrist fractures", are common in both children and adults. They are usually defined as occurring within three centimetres of the radiocarpal joint of the radius, where the lower end of the radius interfaces with two (the lunate and the scaphoid) of the eight bones forming the carpus (the wrist). The majority are closed injuries, the overlying skin remaining intact.</P>
<P>In this review, we consider the treatment of distal radial fracture in adults only, in whom they are one of the most common fractures, predominantly in white and older populations in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Sahlin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahlin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>). In women, the incidence of these fractures increases with age, starting at around 40 years of age. Before this age, the incidence is higher in men (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>). In contrast, between 60 to 94 years of age, females predominate. A recent multi-centre study in the United Kingdom of patients aged 35 years and above with Colles' fracture (see below) reported an annual incidence of 9/10,000 in men and 37/10,000 in women (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Young adults usually sustain this injury as a result of high-energy trauma, such as a traffic accident. In older adults, especially females, the fracture more often results from low-energy or moderate trauma, such as falling from standing height. This reflects the greater fragility of the bone, resulting from disuse or post menopausal osteoporosis. It has been estimated that, at 50 years of age, a white woman in the USA or Northern Europe has a 15% lifetime risk of a distal radius fracture whereas a man has a lifetime risk of just over two per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>). More recent estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>) of the lifetime risks of radius or ulna fracture at 50 years of age are similar: 16.6% for women versus 2.9% for men.</P>
<P>Distal radial fractures are usually treated on an outpatient basis with estimates of around 20% of patients (mainly older people) requiring hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). This figure will include all people receiving surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Classification<BR/>
</B>Surgeons have classified fractures by anatomical configuration or fracture pattern, to help in their management. Simple classifications were based on clinical appearance and often named after those who described them. In the distal radius, the term "Colles' fracture" is still used for a fracture in which there is an obvious and typical clinical deformity (commonly referred to as a dinner fork deformity) - dorsal displacement, dorsal angulation, dorsal comminution, and radial shortening. The introduction of X-rays and other imaging methods made it clear that the characteristic deformity may be associated with a range of different patterns of fracture which may be important in determining the outcome of treatment, and therefore the way in which treatment is conducted. For example, the fracture through the distal radius in a Colles' fracture may be extra-articular (leaving the articular or joint surface of the radius intact) or intra-articular (the articular surface is disrupted, sometimes in a complex manner). Numerous classifications have been devised to define and group different fracture patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Chitnavis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitnavis 1999</LINK>). One of the most commonly used is that of Frykman which distinguishes between extra-articular fractures and intra-articular fractures of the radiocarpal and radio-ulnar joints, and the presence or absence of an associated distal ulnar fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Frykman-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frykman 1967</LINK>). Another commonly used system is the AO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen) system (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>) which divides the fractures into three major groups: group A (extra-articular), group B (simple/partial intra-articular), and group C (complex/complete intra-articular). These three groups are then subdivided yielding 27 different fracture types. Other classification systems have attempted to link fracture type more directly with fracture management. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Cooney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 1993</LINK> proposed a 'Universal Classification' based on fracture displacement, articular involvement, reducibility (whether the fracture can be reduced; that is whether the bone fragments can be put back in place) and stability (whether, once reduced, the fragments will remain so).</P>
<P>
<B>Description of the intervention: percutaneous pinning</B>
<BR/>In the last century, most distal radial fractures in adults were treated conservatively, by reduction of the fracture when displaced, and stabilisation in a plaster cast or other external brace. Clinicians have recognised for many years that, particularly in older people with weakened bones from osteoporosis, the results of such conservative treatment are not consistently satisfactory (for an updated review of the evidence: see <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003b</LINK>). This has resulted in attempts to develop other strategies involving surgery aimed at more accurate reduction and more reliable stabilisation of these fractures.</P>
<P>One such strategy is percutaneous pinning, which involves the percutaneous (through the skin) insertion of pins, which may be threaded, and wires. This is less invasive and, usually, technically simpler than open surgery, where the fractured bone is exposed to direct view. For percutaneous pinning, the reduction of the fracture is closed (see <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003c</LINK>); although pins - such as Kirschner wires - may be used to manipulate the fracture fragments. In a comprehensive account of percutaneous pinning of fractures of the distal radius, <LINK REF="REF-Rayhack-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayhack 1993</LINK> refers to a "myriad of options, decisions and questions that must be addressed". These decisions include: the reduction technique; the method and extent of skin incision; the use and type of radiographic control; the configuration of the pins; the number, size and type of pins; whether the pin ends are left exposed out of the skin or not; and the type and duration of immobilisation after pinning. Later decisions involve the timing and methods for pin removal. A variety of different pinning techniques or methods have been described in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayhack-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayhack 1993</LINK>). In many of these, pins are placed in the bone and used to fix the distal radial fragment(s). In contrast, in Kapandji's double intrafocal technique (<LINK REF="REF-Kapandji-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapandji 1988</LINK>), and subsequent developments of this technique, pins are used to manipulate and then support or 'buttress' the distal radial fragment(s).</P>
<P>
<B>Complications </B>
<BR/>Complications from this injury are diverse and frequent (<LINK REF="REF-Altissimi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altissimi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Atkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooney-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 1980</LINK>). Some are associated with the injury itself. As well as concomitant injuries to soft tissues, fracture displacement can further compromise blood vessels, tendons and nerves, with median nerve dysfunction being the most common complication (<LINK REF="REF-Belsole-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsole 1993</LINK>). Late complications include midcarpal instability and post-traumatic arthritis which can occur several months or years after injury (<LINK REF="REF-Knirk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knirk 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taleisnik-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taleisnik 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications can also result from treatment interventions and include residual finger stiffness, which may be due to faulty application of plaster casts (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), and pin track infection and soft tissue injury from percutaneous pinning. Complex regional pain syndrome type 1, generally termed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), but also referred to as algodystrophy, Sudeck's atrophy and sometimes shoulder-hand syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1996</LINK>) is a major complication requiring many months of physiotherapy to alleviate symptoms (pain and tenderness, impairment of joint mobility, swelling, dystrophy, vasomotor instability) in serious cases. The etiology of RSD is often unclear. </P>
<P>
<B>Why it is important to do this review</B>
<BR/>Percutaneous pinning is one of the key methods for surgical fixation of distal radial fractures. It is attractive because it is minimally invasive and relatively simple and quick to perform compared with the other surgical methods employed for these fractures. It is unclear whether percutaneous pinning produces superior results to conservative treatment, and if so, what is the best method to achieve this. The answers to these questions are likely to depend particularly on fracture configuration and bone quality.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>We aimed to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of percutaneous pinning for fractures of the distal radius in skeletally mature people.</P>
<P>We aimed to compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of the following for adults with these injuries. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Any method of percutaneous pinning versus conservative treatment involving plaster or brace use.</LI>
<LI>Any method of percutaneous pinning versus any other method of percutaneous pinning.</LI>
<LI>Any technique or type of material or device used for percutaneous pinning versus any other technique or type of material or device at surgery or post-operatively.</LI>
<LI>Any type or duration of post-operative immobilisation versus any other type or duration of immobilisation including none.</LI>
<LI>Any method or timing of pin or wire removal versus any other method or timing of pin or wire removal including no removal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We considered these effects primarily in terms of patient-assessed functional outcome and satisfaction, and other measures of function and impairment, pain and discomfort, the incidence of complications, anatomical deformity and use of resources.</P>
<P>We planned to study the outcomes in different age groups and for different types of fractures, especially whether they are extra-articular or intra-articular.</P>

<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>All review authors independently assessed potentially eligible trials identified via the search for inclusion using a pre-piloted form. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>Two of the review authors (HH and MV) extracted trial details and data using a data extraction form. All disagreements were resolved by discussion. We contacted trialists of trials that were not reported in full journal publications for additional information and data. Contact with other trial authors was dictated by the vintage of the publication, a general impression of the expected gain, and anticipated or known difficulty in locating trial authors.</P>
<P>Results were collected for the final follow-up time for which these were available. We also recorded where clinically important differences had been reported at intermediate follow-up assessments but were no longer apparent at final follow up.</P>

<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>In this review, risk of bias is assessed in terms of methodological quality.<BR/>
<BR/>Two of the review authors (HH and MV) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using a pre-piloted form. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Titles of journals, names of authors or supporting institutions were not masked at any stage. A modification of the quality assessment tool used in the previous 'umbrella' review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>) was used. In this, each item was graded either 'Y', '?' or 'N', respectively indicating that the quality criteria were met for the item ("Yes"), or possibly or only partially met for the item ("Possible, partial"), or not met ("No"). The rating scheme covering 11 aspects of trial validity, plus brief notes of coding guidelines for selected items, is given in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>Where available, quantitative data, both dichotomous and continuous, that are reported in individual trial reports for outcomes listed in the inclusion criteria are presented in the analyses. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals are calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals calculated for continuous outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues<BR/>
</B>No unit of analysis issues<B> </B>arose in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
<BR/>Where appropriate, we performed intention-to-treat analyses to include all patients randomised to the intervention groups. In our protocol for this review we indicated that we would where appropriate investigate the effect of missing data (drop outs and exclusions) by conducting best and worse case scenarios. So far, we have found no included dataset where this would have been appropriate. We were alert to the potential mislabelling or non identification of standard errors and standard deviations. There were no confidence interval data available to calculate missing standard deviations, and we did not assume values in order to present standard deviations in the analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>
</B>Heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of the forest plot (analysis) along with consideration of the test for heterogeneity and the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases</B>
<BR/>There were insufficient data to assess publication bias; for example, by preparing a funnel plot.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis (meta-analysis) </B>
<BR/>Where appropriate, results of comparable groups of trials were pooled. As stipulated in the protocol we used the fixed-effect model and 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>There were no data available to carry out our pre-specified subgroup analyses by age and gender and type of fracture (primarily, extra-articular versus intra-articular fractures). As stipulated beforehand, presentation in separate subgroups was performed where there was a fundamental difference in pinning method (such as transfixation versus Kapandji's intrafocal method). If, in a future update, we wish to test whether subgroups are statistically significantly different from one another, we plan to test the interaction using the technique outlined by Altman and Bland (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>There were no data available to carry out pre-specified sensitivity analyses examining various aspects of trial and review methodology, including the effects of missing data, study quality (specifically allocation concealment, outcome assessor blinding and reportage of surgical experience), and inclusion of trials only reported in abstracts.</P>
<P>
<B>Interpretation of the evidence</B>
<BR/>We have graded the findings of the treatment comparisons according to the six categories of effectiveness used by contributors to Clinical Evidence (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 2006</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) to assist our interpretation of the evidence.</P>

<BR/>Results of the search</B>
<BR/>The search for trials predated the development of this review, which is essentially a reworked update of part of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>) covering all surgical intervention for these fractures. We have not documented the numbers of references retrieved by electronic searches; updates of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL are now generated on a weekly basis. Of 24 potentially eligible studies put forward for study selection, 13 were included, five were excluded and six are in 'Studies awaiting assessment'.</P>
<P>Aside from the two most recently published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>), the other included trials were present in the review covering all surgical intervention for these fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> appeared as an ongoing trial in <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>Eleven of the 13 included studies were fully reported in medical journals. Trial reports of the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>) were only available as abstracts. Seven of the included trials were initially located by handsearching. The rest were located in the following ways: The Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialist Register (2); EMBASE (1); and MEDLINE (3).</P>
<P>Details of the methods, participants, interventions and outcomes of individual trials are provided in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Setting</I>
</B>
<BR/>The publication dates of the main reports of these trials span 16 years; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> being the earliest. Aside from <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>, which had two centres, the studies were all single centre studies, mainly conducted in teaching hospitals. They each took place in one of seven countries (Belgium (3), France (3), Germany (2), India (1), Morocco (1), Spain (1), UK (2)). Translations were obtained for the two trials in French (<LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>The 13 included trials involved a total of 940 participants, most of whom were female and older adults. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>), both reported in abstract only, provided no information on gender or age of their study populations; although <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> referred to an "elderly" population. Nine studies had more female participants, ranging between 68% and 89% of their study populations. There were more male than female participants in <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>, and probably in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>; however, the disparities in the data provided in the three papers reporting this trial meant that we could not establish this. The trial population of <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> was also markedly younger (mean age 34 years) than the other studies, whose trial populations had mean ages ranging from 55 years (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) to 71.5 years (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>). The youngest (15 years) and oldest recorded (92 years) participants appeared in the same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>). It is clear that the vast majority of participants in the included trials were skeletally mature: five trials excluded children either by explicitly setting a lower age limit or stipulating that the participants should be adults or skeletally mature. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>) further restricted the trial population to more mature adults: above 60 and 45 years respectively. An upper age limit of 60 years was applied in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> and 80 years in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Fractures</I>
</B>
<BR/>A variety of descriptions was used to define the types of fracture in the included trials. Nonetheless, explicit reference to dorsally displaced or Colles' fractures was made in all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>, in which it was also clear that the fractures were dorsally displaced. Thus volar displaced fractures such as Barton's (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1988</LINK>) were not included. Trials often used descriptive terms such as displaced, unstable and comminuted, and referred to classification systems such as Frykman (<LINK REF="REF-Frykman-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frykman 1967</LINK>) or the AO system (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>). While <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> included a few people with open fractures, it is likely that all the fractures in the other trials were closed, and certain in those trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) stipulating the exclusion of open fractures. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>) described radiological criteria for defining an unstable fracture, thus defining the extent of displacement required for trial entry. None of the trials testing definitive treatment explicitly included fractures that had redisplaced after a primary reduction. Of the 10 trials applying or reporting fracture type according to an established (not own) classification system, two trials grouped fractures according to more than one classification system. The Frykman system was used by seven trials, the AO system by four trials and Castaing system by one trial. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>) explicitly included both extra-articular and intra-articular fractures, although the extent of intra-articular involvement was often limited; such as the exclusion of radiocarpal joint articular fractures in <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>, and of fractures with more than two articular fractures in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>. Three trials only included or involved extra-articular fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>), whereas two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>) included intra-articular fractures only. The involvement of the articular surface of the distal radius fracture was not clear in either <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>, where dislocated radiocarpal joint fractures were excluded, or <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>, which only referred to Colles' type fractures.</P>

<I>Comparisons</I>
</B>
<BR/>The 13 included trials have been grouped according to the comparisons addressed by each trial. While most of the trials evaluated definitive treatment, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) tested the duration of immobilisation after surgery.<BR/>

A concise summary of the participants, fracture type, timing and details of the interventions for the six trials is given in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. </P>
<P>Each trial employed a different pinning technique or duration of immobilisation, or both. Various numbers of pins were used to transfix the distal radius fragment to the radial shaft in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>: 2 pins; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>: 2 pins; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>: 3 pins; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>; 1 pin). In <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>, two pins were placed obliquely through the distal radial fragments across the inferior radio-ulnar joint and fixed in the ulna. <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> used Kapandji's triple intrafocal technique, where three pins introduced at the fracture site and driven into the radial shaft support the fracture fragment. <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> also differed from the other five trials in that there was a difference in the duration of plaster immobilisation between the two intervention groups (Kapandji's pinning group: 1 week; conservative treatment group: 6 weeks).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> compared Kapandji intrafocal pinning with three Kirschner wires versus with Py's isoelastic pinning, where two wires were inserted across the fracture and along the medullary canal, in 110 people. Both groups had immobilisation in a forearm cast for four weeks. The majority of the 88 participants with complete data at follow up were male (75%) with an average age of 34 years. All had dorsally displaced fractures, with or without displacement of the ulnar styloid. Though some involvement of the articular surface of the distal radius was possible in <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>, dislocated radiocarpal joint fractures were excluded.</P>
<P>Modified Kapandji fixation versus Willenegger fixation<I>
<BR/>
</I>In <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>, one patient group was treated with a modified Kapandji method, involving intrafocal pinning with two Kirschner wires combined with a third wire inserted via the radial styloid used to fix the fracture, followed by six weeks of immobilisation in a volar splint. Physiotherapy, with the volar splint removed, was started at three weeks. The other patient group received Willenegger pinning, where two wires introduced via the styloid process were inserted across the fracture, followed by immobilisation in a forearm cast for six weeks. The 100, mainly female (85%), participants with an average age of 65 years had Colles' type fractures, either extra- and intra-articular (AO types A2, A3 or C1).</P>

<P>The quality of trial methodology based on trial reports was disappointing.

<B>Intention-to-treat analysis</B> (item 2)<BR/>Clear statements of participant flow with evidence of intention-to-treat analysis were available for three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>). There were serious problems in four trials. In two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>), both with a high loss (20%) to follow up, baseline data were not provided for the whole study population. In both <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>, there was no explanation on the imbalances in the numbers randomised into the two groups, and no information on loss to follow up.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding of outcome assessors</B> (item 3)<BR/>This was only confirmed in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> where all participants were independently reviewed by a physician who was not involved in their treatment and who was unaware of the duration of post-operative immobilisation. Total blinding of outcome assessment is impractical for trials testing surgical interventions but it is possible for some outcomes and more so at longer term follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparability of baseline characteristics</B> (item 4)<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>) provided sufficient information indicating the similarity in the baseline characteristics of gender, age and type of fracture. Potentially important imbalances between treatment groups in participant characteristics were found in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> (age and activity) and <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> (gender and high-energy injuries).</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding of patients and treatment providers</B> (items 5 and 6) <BR/>These are unlikely in these studies and none was claimed.</P>
<P>
<B>Care programme comparability</B> (item 7)<BR/>Comparability of care programmes comprising interventions (such as type of anaesthesia, timing of the interventions, comparability of the experience of the health professionals applying the interventions (operator bias), and rehabilitation) other than the trial interventions proved hard to confirm. However, it was considered highly likely in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>). Distinctive differences between the two groups where an intervention other than the trial intervention was used exclusively in one group can change the actual comparison under test. For instance, in <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>, physiotherapy was provided after three weeks of immobilisation to the modified Kapandji pinning group only.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of inclusion criteria </B>(item 8)<BR/>Most of the included trials provided sufficient trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to define the study population. This item was rated 'N' ("not defined") where no details of the type of fractures were available ("Colles'" was not considered enough).</P>
<P>
<B>Definition of outcome measures and quality of outcome measurement</B> (items 9 and 10)<BR/>The definition of outcome measurement was clear enough to give a good idea of what was recorded in 10 of the 11 trials written up as full reports. Only <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> was rated as having 'optimal' quality outcome measurement, which included use of a validated patient assessed quality of life instrument and active follow-up. Of note, but not rated, was the grading or scoring of overall functional outcome according to scoring systems in several trials. These systems, which often included anatomical and clinical outcomes, included modifications of other scoring systems such as that of Gartland and Werley (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>). Also, noted but not rated, were instances where adjustments were made for hand dominance. The variety of schemes used and other outcome measures reported by the trials is evident from inspection of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>
<B>Length of follow up</B> (item 11)<BR/>Follow up ranged from three months (<LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) to two years (<LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>), but was of variable duration in <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK>.</P>

<I>Percutaneous pinning versus plaster cast immobilisation alone </I>
</B>
<BR/>Percutaneous pinning was compared with plaster immobilisation in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>). Five trials applied across-fracture pinning whereas <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> used Kapandji's triple intrafocal technique with early mobilisation and is thus considered separately for most outcomes (functional and anatomical) in the following.</P>
<P>The functional scoring systems used by three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>), all derived from Gartland and Werley's scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), also rated deformity and various complications. Consistently (test for heterogeneity: I² = 0%) superior functional grades were obtained in the pinning group in three of the fracture fixation trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>): <I>see</I> Analysis 01.01 Functional grading: not excellent (Pins through fracture). 29/68 versus 54/67; relative risk (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.71; also Analysis 01.02 Functional grading: fair or poor (Pins through fracture). 8/68 versus 25/67; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.64). <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> found no significant differences between the two groups in the physical or mental score domains of the Short-Form 36 at four months (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.03) nor in either unilateral (reported P = 0.43) or bilateral (reported P = 0.74) activities of daily living scores at one year. Two people, both in the conservative treatment group, out of 11 former labourers in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> did not return to their former work (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.04). The failure to state the numbers of participants in the two treatment groups at one-year follow up meant that the results of individual functional outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> could not be presented in the Analyses. Results for individual functional outcomes were often incomplete for the other four trials. Grip strength, presented as a percentage of the grip strength of the unaffected arm, was greater in the pinning group in both <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> (77% versus 72%; reported P = 0.54) and <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> (85% versus 65%; P not reported) and demonstrably significantly better in the pinning group in <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.05 Under half grip strength at 6 months. 0/23 versus 11/22; RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in pain scores at one year (0.7 versus 1.2 on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) point scale; reported P = 0.16) in <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> or in the numbers of participants with occasional pain at long-term follow up in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.06. 2/20 versus 4/20; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.43). <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the components of wrist movement at one year except for ulnar deviation (93% versus 76% of normal; reported P = 0.009). All components of wrist movement were significantly better in the pinning group in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.07). The overall range of wrist motion was reported to be better in the pinning group in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> (80% versus 60% of normal), as were the components of wrist movement in <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK> (statistical significant differences were reported for extension and ulnar deviation). <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> reported that the range of motion along the three axes showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. </P>
<P>The difference in the mean functional scores (pain, functional status, range of motion and grip strength were rated) of the two groups of <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> was not significant, and similar numbers in the two groups had a satisfactory outcome (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.02). Although eight of the conservative treatment group achieved an excellent grade, none did in the pinning group (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.01 Functional grading: not excellent (Pins supporting fracture). 48/48 versus 42/50; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34), the spread of the functional scores shown in a graph in the trial report seems to indicate that little should be made of this. <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> also found no significant differences between the two treatment groups in grip strength or finger movements at final follow up. </P>
<P>Complications suffered by the participants of all six trials are presented in Analysis 01.08. Null events have also been entered when reported. Redisplacement requiring secondary treatment only occurred in the conservative treatment group (0/115 versus 22/154; RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.37). Complications associated with the pins (K-wires) and pin insertion were few and generally minor in consequence except for the removal of K-wires after a pin-track infection in <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> and the K-wire migration in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK> that caused a redisplacement of the fracture. There was no report of tendon rupture or injury. Complications relating to the median nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, were more common, but not statistically significantly so, in the conservative treatment group (3/161 versus 11/202; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.46). All six cases of superficial radial nerve injury, one of which persisted, occurred in the pinning group in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>; these may have resulted from injuries caused by the radially-sited pin. The incidence of RSD was similar in the two groups. There was a high incidence of short-term RSD in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>; this persisted in twice as many participants of the pinning group (4/48 versus 2/50). There was one case of shoulder hand syndrome in <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>. Slightly more patients (21/48 versus 29/50) in the conservative treatment group had diminished finger function at six weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>Anatomical results were better in the pinning group compared with the plaster group in all five fracture fixation trials. Redisplacement requiring secondary treatment (reduction or reduction and K-wire fixation) occurred only in conservatively treated fractures in four trials (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.08 Complications). The sole redisplacement in the pinning group was caused by K-wire (pin) migration in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>. Healing of all fractures was confirmed in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK> and is likely in the other trials. There was a greater incidence of wrist deformity, depicted by angulated malunion, articular incongruity or an articular step in excess of two millimetres, in the conservative treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.09). Significantly more people in the conservative treatment group had prominence of the ulnar styloid, stated as indicating radial collapse, in <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.09. 0/23 versus 12/22; RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.61). <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> reported that a quarter of pinning group participants had cosmetic deformity of the wrist compared with over a half of those treated conservatively. Moreover the gross appearance of the wrist was worse in participants of the conservative treatment group. Significantly better overall anatomical grades were achieved by the pinning group in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.10). Losses in radial angulation, radial length and dorsal angulation from the reduced position were reported as being significantly greater in the conservative treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK>. Complete data for anatomical measures were only available for five-weeks follow up in <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> and at final follow up for <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK> show better values for the pinning group in dorsal and radial angulation, and radial length (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.11). </P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> did not report superior anatomical results for the Kapandji's pinning group. Whilst radial shift (lateral) was less in the pinning group (mean values: 0.5 mm versus 1.5 mm), radial shortening was greater (mean values: 2 mm versus &lt; 1 mm). <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> claimed that these differences were statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> made no specific mention of the apparently greater, though indicated as not statistically different, difference in dorsal angulation between the two groups.</P>

<I>Kapandji fixation versus trans-styloid fixation</I>
</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>, Kapandji fixation followed by immediate mobilisation was compared with trans-styloid fixation followed by around six weeks of plaster cast immobilisation in 120 people. Neither baseline data nor results were provided for three participants who died, 15 who were lost to follow up and six with missing data. Standard deviations were not provided for functional and anatomical outcomes presented as continuous outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK> reported there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in either grip or pinch strength, both presented as a percentage of the uninjured wrist (one-year results: mean grip strength 84% versus 83%; mean pinch strength 89% versus 87%). More participants of the Kapandji group were reported to suffer pain but the difference between the groups in the mean visual analogue scale values was not statistically significant (two-year results: 7.6 versus 6.9 on a 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain) point scale). Wrist mobility was reported to be significantly better in the Kapandji group up until the removal of the K-wires at six to eight weeks (all values as percentage of uninjured arm, flexion: 59% versus 46%; extension: 58% versus 44%; radial deviation: 60% versus 38%; ulnar deviation: 61% versus 52%; pronation: 80% versus 62%; supination: 76% versus 64%) but not subsequently. <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK> considered that better early range of motion results for the Kapandji group related to the early mobilisation of this group and occurred at the cost of increased pain.</P>
<P>There were more complications in the Kapandji group (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.01). In particular, there were more Kapandji group participants with persistent symptoms related to the superficial radial nerve (8/54 versus 3/42; RR 2.07, 95% CI 0.59 to 7.34), and an identical result for bone-scan confirmed RSD. <LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK> suggested that the radial nerve complications were related to Kirschner wire removal; these are closer to the sensory branches of the radial nerve in Kapandji pinning. The redisplaced fracture in the trans-styloid fixation group was treated with an external fixator. There were no cases of tendon or vascular injury or median nerve dysfunction. All four cases of pin-track infection were superficial.</P>
<P>Similar long-term results for anatomical outcomes in the two groups were evident from graphs presented in the trial report. The mean ulnar variance, which was positive in both groups, was approximately one millimetre greater in the Kapandji group; the increase in ulnar variance from the reduction position was said to be statistically more significant in this group. One of the six over-reduced (by 15 degrees in the anterior direction) fractures in the Kapandji group developed a more extreme anterior tilt whilst the two over-reduced fractures in the trans-styloid group did not worsen. The four cases of DISI (dorsal intercalated segment instability) and seven cases of VISI (volar intercalated segment instability) were reported as being "evenly" distributed through the two groups.</P>

</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> compared Kapandji intrafocal pinning with Py's isoelastic pinning in 110 people but presented results only for the 88 participants who were available at 27 months follow up. </P>
<P>Function, rated with the Jakim scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Jakim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakim 1991</LINK>), was presented in two categories; subjective (pain and function) and objective (mobility, grip strength and deformity). The results for subjective function were almost the same for the two groups (<I>see </I>Analysis 03.01) but the difference in the objective results was statistically significant (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.02), as was the difference in the combined function and radiological results (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.03). A superior result was claimed for the Py's pinning group but the mean values for the objective and overall scores presented in Table III of the trial report show the converse (<I>see</I> Analyses 03.02 and 03.03). Thus, two set of values have been presented in the four analyses showing mean Jakim scores: the first set of values are those in the report; in the second set the results for the two groups are reversed, based on the assumption that the rows in the Table were presented in the reverse order. Though slightly fewer Py's pinning patients had an unsatisfactory outcome according to the grading of the overall outcome into four categories (excellent, good, fair, poor), the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.04, overall outcome grades: not excellent 20/42 versus 16/46; RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.27; and overall outcome grades: fair or poor 7/42 versus 6/46; RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.50).</P>
<P>Kapandji intrafocal pinning was associated with significantly more complications (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.05). <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> suggested that the excess of secondary fracture displacements (7/42 versus 2/46; RR 3.83, 95% CI 0.84 to 17.44) and wire displacements (6/42 versus 0/46; RR 14.21, 95% CI 0.82 to 244.80) in the Kapandji group was linked to posterior comminution of the original fracture. The iatrogenic fracture in the Py's pinning group was successfully treated by a plate; <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> suggested that a missed epiphyseal fracture generated a weakness that resulted in the shearing of the epiphyseal fragment when the posterior pin was inserted. Similar numbers of participants suffered tendon rupture or RSD; all participants with ruptured tendons had successful secondary tendon transfer, and all those with RSD required prolonged rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Anatomical results including dorsal and radial angulation, radial length, articulation of the radio-ulnar joint, incongruity ("step-off") and signs of arthritis were scored according to Jakim's scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Jakim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakim 1991</LINK>). A superior result was claimed for the Py's pinning group but again the mean values for the radiological section presented in the report show the converse (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.06). As noted above, more secondary displacement of fractures occurred in the Kapandji group.<BR/>

Moreover, the modified Kapandji group started physiotherapy after three weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> reported that the modified Kapandji group had significantly higher modified Martini scores (this composite score included pain, subjective assessment, strength, work and sports, wrist and forearm mobility, radiological results and complications) at a median of 10 months follow up: 34 versus 28 on a scale 0 (worst) to 38 (best); reported P &lt; 0.005). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the numbers of people with complications (<I>see </I>Analysis 04.01). Two participants of the Willenegger group had an undefined "conversion procedure". Both cases of RSD resolved after treatment; and both cases of carpal tunnel syndrome were operated on. <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> reported there was no significant difference between the two groups in operating times but that imaging time was significantly less in the modified Kapandji group (89.5 versus 156 seconds; reported P &lt; 0.004).</P>

<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>) compared biodegradable pins with Kirschner wires in 70 people. <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK> used Kapandji's intrafocal pinning with two wires whereas two pins or wires were inserted across the fracture, via the radial styloid, in <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>. Despite the differences in the pinning techniques, the results for the two trials are presented together in the analyses but no pooling has been performed. (The possibility that the subcutaneous protrusion of the ends of the pins in the Kapandji pinning technique could increase the specific complications of biodegradable implants was raised in <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>; this could also have applied to <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK>.)</P>
<P>Functional recovery in the Kirschner wire group was reported to have been quicker in <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK> although the eventual difference between the two groups (based on a five point scale) was reported as not being statistically significant, and no participant had any restriction in activities of daily living. The range of motion was satisfactory in both groups; again there was no statistically significant difference between them (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.01). <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK> did not report whether the greater loss in range of motion in the biodegradable pinning group was statistically significant: mean loss compared to contralateral wrist: 30 versus 20 degrees (extension/flexion); 35 versus 30 degrees (pronation/supination).</P>
<P>In both trials there was an excess of complications in the biodegradable pinning group (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.02). Difficulties during pin insertion in <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK> (8/19 versus 0/21; RR 18.70, 95% CI 1.15 to 303.59) contributed to the longer duration of the operation in the biodegradable pinning group (mean duration: 40.5 versus 23.5 minutes). Secondary surgery was performed for the two tendon ruptures (Kirschner wiring group) and for one of the two cases of carpal tunnel syndrome; both of the latter were attributed to swelling brought on by the biodegradable rod. Painful scars, sinus formation and severe osteolytic reactions (9/15 versus 0/21; RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.20 to 299.63) were also related to the degradation and resorption of the biodegradable material in <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>. One of the people with a sinus showed a non-specific foreign-body reaction with abundant giant cells. Most of the severe osteolytic reactions were most obvious around three to six months post-operatively, but had resolved or regressed by one year. <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK> pointed out that the main putative advantage of biodegradable implants, namely that they do not need to be removed, was offset by the "management cost and inconvenience of the late inflammatory reactions".</P>
<P>Final anatomical results were considered satisfactory in both groups in <LINK REF="STD-Casteleyn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Casteleyn 1992</LINK>, who found no statistically significant differences between the two groups (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.03).

<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) compared plaster cast immobilisation for one week versus six weeks after surgery in 120 people. Given the different methods of percutaneous pinning (trans-styloid fixation in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> and Kapandji intrafocal pinning in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>) and clear heterogeneity in the results of the few comparable outcomes (all complications) with data, pooled results are not presented for this comparison.</P>
<P>Overall, there was little difference between the two treatment groups in functional outcome in either trial. <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> reported there were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean duration of sick leave (7 weeks) for the 39 trial participants who worked, in the numbers (14) with functional discomfort during domestic chores, or in the numbers of "sportsmen" with residual discomfort (3 of 22). One participant, who had RSD, of the six weeks group was the only one of 19 people in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> who had not returned to work by three months. At final follow up (1 year: <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>; 3 months: <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>), differences in grip strength, which was greater in the early mobilisation group in both trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>: 25 kg versus 21 kg; <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>: 55% versus 44% of normal side), were reported not to be statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> reported there was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean pain scores (13 versus 12.5 (15 = no pain)) or use of analgesics. Though, as calculated from percentages in the trial report, fewer people in the early mobilisation groups had pain at follow up in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> (see Analysis 06.01; 4/27 versus 10/30; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.25); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. All the mean values for the six parameters for range of movement in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> were greater in the early mobilisation group but only the difference in the ulnar deviation was reported as being statistically significant (39 versus 37 degrees; reported P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in flexion (74% versus 77% of normal side) or extension (72% versus 74% of normal side) in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>, although the results were marginally better in the group immobilised for six weeks. </P>
<P>None of the differences between the two treatment groups in the reported clinical outcomes were statistically significant for either trial. Analysis 06.02 presents the numbers of participants with various complications. These were fewer overall with similar numbers in the two groups in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>. Surgery was necessary for the person of the six weeks group who had ruptures of two tendons, and an anterior approach to wire removal was required for a displaced wire in another person in the same group. Three of the four cases of persistent radial nerve paraesthesia or hypoaesthesia appeared only after Kirschner wire removal. In <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>, all the complications occurred in the early group with the exception of one case of RSD, referred to above. One of the five wire displacements in the early mobilisation group in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> was associated with a tendon rupture, one resulted from poor technique (wiring was done by "junior" operators) and two from osteoporotic bone. In <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>, the wrists of three people with "treatment failure", one due to the need for tendon repair and two due to the risk of secondary displacement, were immobilised. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups of in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> in the numbers of people who were disappointed with their outcome (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.03: 3/30 versus 1/30; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.23).</P>
<P>Similar radiological results in the two treatment groups were reported by both trials. As it is likely that the unusually small "standard deviations" provided in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> were standard errors, the results for dorsal and radial angulation and radial length with standard deviations calculated from the supposed standard errors are shown in Analysis 06.04. These results are compatible with the claim of no statistical significance. The three radiological parameters listed in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> are defined in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. However, the results at three months seem to be for dorsal angulation (volar tilt: 6.9 versus 6.5 degrees), radial inclination (21.4 versus 21.3 degrees) and ulnar variance (1.4 mm versus 1.1 mm).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> concluded that additional immobilisation was not necessary after trans-styloid fixation, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> concluded that early mobilisation after Kapandji intrafocal fixation should only be used in patients with good quality bone stock who would comply with the instructions after surgery.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-25 11:39:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review of one of the most common surgical interventions for one of the most common fractures has only 13 trials, involving a total of 940 participants, and evaluates six comparisons, with data pooling for one comparison. There is either no or limited evidence to inform the many choices for percutaneous pinning; this variation is illustrated by the questions addressed by and the interventions used in the included trials, as well as those for the six trials in 'Studies awaiting assessment'.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of the review methods</B>
<BR/>As this review abided by the criteria and methods set out in a published protocol, we have restricted our comments to two issues. The first is whether trials have been missed or inappropriately excluded in our search and selection processes. The second concerns decisions concerning pooling and subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Our search was comprehensive and built on searches carried out over many years prior to the separate development of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). It has included the handsearch of conference proceedings and checks for ongoing trials. An inclusive and benefit-of-doubt approach during trial searches has been maintained throughout by the lead author (HH). Additionally, trial authors of unpublished trials have been sent requests for information and trial reports. While it is possible that we have missed some potentially eligible trials, it is questionable whether these would have ultimately been included if they had remained unpublished and substantially under-reported. We guarded against study selection bias by the independent selection of eligible trials by all three review authors.</P>
<P>We restricted pooling to one comparison. As stated beforehand, we treated Kapandji intrafocal pinning as a distinctly separate method of pinning to across-fracture methods. The decision not to pool data from trials of these two different pinning approaches is supported by the clear and statistically significant differences in effect (e.g. <I>see</I> Analysis 01.02. Test for interaction: two tail Z-test = 0.02). Though the five across-fracture trials were heterogeneous, such as in the type of fracture, the pooled results for the few available outcomes were statistically homogeneous. It was not possible to conduct subgroup analyses to explore other trial characteristics or sensitivity analyses, including those to explore the effects of the high loss to follow up in some trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of the review evidence</B>
<BR/>Overall, the available evidence is limited in scope and quantity, and is of uncertain validity. There is a potential for chance findings from these 13 small trials and, in addition, any apparent comparability of results of interventions tested within some trials should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect or no difference. Systematic bias, in the form of selection, performance, exclusion or assessment bias, or a combination of these could not be ruled out for any trial. Incomplete reporting of methods and results was a major problem in many of these trials, and especially <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> which were available in conference abstracts only. Another limitation was the inadequate assessment of outcome, particularly of function and in the long-term. Non-validated outcome measures, such as those based on the Gartland and Werley scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), that combine aspects of function, pain, deformity and complications are particularly crude indicators of outcome. Considerable caution is needed when interpreting these, and more so when the scores have been categorised. Many trials predated the development of validated patient functional assessment instruments such as Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermid 2000</LINK>). These help to standardise functional assessment in a meaningful way and assist interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Amadio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amadio 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Applicability of the review evidence</B>
<BR/>Generalising the findings of the included trials, should these be valid, is hampered by inadequate reporting of study details, such as the type and severity of the fracture, and bone quality. The variety of fracture classification systems, with associated issues of reliability and validity further complicates this area (<LINK REF="REF-Jupiter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jupiter 1997</LINK>). For example, the two fracture classifications used by trials in this review (the AO and Frykman) place different emphases on various fracture patterns and anatomical components. Studies have revealed unsatisfactory interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility for both classification systems (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996b</LINK>), and neither was useful for predicting clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Flinkkila-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flinkkila 1998</LINK>). Two trials in this review stipulated criteria for anatomical displacement of the fracture for trial entry. However, <LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996a</LINK> found quite broad margins of error ("tolerance limits") for anatomical measurements in general. This with other factors, such as variations in anatomical reference points, again hinders treatment comparison.</P>
<P>Fracture instability was the inherent or explicit criterion for many of the included trials, but it is not established how best to predict this. A recent study of 4024 patients concluded that patient age, metaphyseal comminution of the fracture and ulnar variance were the most important factors in predicting instability of distal radial fractures (<LINK REF="REF-MacKenney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKenney 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparisons</B>
<BR/>A summary of the conclusions of effectiveness drawn from the findings of each comparison is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. Here, the effectiveness of each intervention relative to the 'control' intervention in each comparison is graded according to the categories of effectiveness (1: Beneficial; 2: Likely to be beneficial; 3: Trade off between benefits and harms; 4: Unknown effectiveness; 5: Unlikely to be beneficial; 6: Likely to be ineffective or harmful) described in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Some notes in justification of the grading, some qualifying statements and other comments are also provided.</P>

</I>
</B>The six trials for this comparison were heterogeneous in terms of patient and fracture characteristics, pinning techniques and aftercare (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). As specified in the protocol, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>, which used the Kapandji pinning technique, for functional and anatomical outcomes were presented separately.</P>
<P>The better anatomical result, both in maintaining the reduced fracture position and in final anatomy, found in the across-fracture pinning group is likely to be valid. The extent of improvement varied. The two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Merchan-97" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Merchan 97</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>) with potentially the most unstable fractures (all participants had comminuted intra-articular fractures) had higher proportions of conservatively-treated participants with redisplacements requiring secondary treatment and deformity. <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> found the improvement in radiological parameters to be "marginal". Superior functional results were found in the pinning group in three trials but these are partly based on non-validated scoring systems that also rated deformity, and small numbers of participants. Neither <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2005</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Verhulst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Verhulst 1990</LINK> found significantly improved functional outcome in their "elderly" populations. Complications of pinning were generally minor. In all, there is some evidence to suggest superior results of percutaneous pinning to stabilise fracture fragments compared with conservative treatment. However, the available evidence is insufficient to address questions such as those regarding the fracture pattern and the type of pinning.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK> was compromised by poor methodology and inconsistent reporting in the three trial reports. Kapandji pinning with early mobilisation (one week of plaster immobilisation) for dorsally displaced extra-articular fractures was not associated with better anatomical or functional results to plaster cast immobilisation for six weeks, three weeks of which involved an above-elbow cast. There was a high rate of complications, in particular of RSD and finger stiffness, in <LINK REF="STD-Stoffelen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffelen 1998</LINK>; of note were the six cases of radial nerve injury from pin placement. The available evidence from this trial is insufficient to show the effectiveness of the Kapandji approach.</P>

<I>Kapandji fixation versus trans-styloid fixation</I>
<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lenoble-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lenoble 1995</LINK>) compared two or three-pin Kapandji pinning with two-pin trans-styloid fixation in dorsally displaced fractures. These were stated to be the two most commonly used methods in France for such fractures. Final anatomical and functional results were similar in both groups, though better early mobility but more pain occurred in the Kapandji pinning group reflecting their earlier mobilisation. The exclusion of 20% of participants from the analyses, already small numbers and other methodological shortcomings weakens the validity of the trial's results. However the higher, while not statistically significantly so, numbers with superficial radial nerve symptoms in the Kapandji pinning group is plausibly related to the pin placement of this method.</P>
<P>
<I>Kapandji fixation versus Py's isoelastic pinning</I>
<BR/>Contradictory anatomical and functional results, based on an unvalidated scoring scheme were reported in the only trial comparing these two methods (<LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK>) for dorsally displaced fractures. There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions of difference between the two groups. However, the suggestion in <LINK REF="STD-Fikry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fikry 1998</LINK> that the higher numbers of complications, specifically fracture and wire displacement, in the three-pin Kapandji pinning group were associated with fractures with dorsal comminution seems pertinent to the use of this method. Others have also advised the restriction of the Kapandji pinning to non-comminuted fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1999</LINK>) as well as noting the further refinements of the method such as the use of "arum" pins which may improve results and lessen tendon-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayhack-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayhack 1993</LINK>).</P>

<I>Modified Kapandji fixation versus Willenegger fixation<BR/>
</I>The modified Kapandji method used in <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> is essentially a combination of fracture fixation and intrafocal pinning. The comparison in <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> should not be viewed as simply testing two approaches for pinning because of other differences such as the additional physiotherapy starting after three weeks in the modified Kapandji group. The serious methodological flaws, in particular the use of an unvalidated and composite scoring scheme, variable follow up times and exclusion of 19% of participants from the analyses, of <LINK REF="STD-Strohm-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Strohm 2004</LINK> mean that the promising results for the "Kapandji" method should not be taken as proven. The smaller mean duration of radiographic exposure for the modified Kapandji group is curious given that it seems the more complicated of the two pinning procedures.</P>

There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in anatomical and functional outcome between the two groups. What were evident, however, were the extra demands at surgery of insertion of biodegradable pins, and the significant excess of complications associated with biodegradable material. Thus the recommendation, expressed by both studies, not to use biodegradable pins for these fractures (in adults) seems justified. This conclusion may be moderated should evidence become available for a trial, involving 115 participants, currently in 'Studies awaiting assessment'.</P>

Thus it is likely that the findings of one trial may not apply to the other. No statistically significant differences between one and six weeks plaster cast immobilisation in functional, clinical or radiological results were found in either trial; except for a clinically irrelevant difference of in ulnar deviation in <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK>. However, more complications occurred in the early mobilisation group after Kapandji pinning in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK>. As <LINK REF="STD-Allain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 1999</LINK> acknowledged, the small numbers involved are not enough to conclude that one week immobilisation, reducing the inconvenience and problems through disuse associated with prolonged immobilisation, was sufficient after trans-styloid fixation for certain fracture patterns. Early mobilisation is put forward as a key advantage of Kapandji fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Kapandji-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapandji 1988</LINK>) and often applied. Whilst the excess of complications in the early mobilisation group in <LINK REF="STD-Milliez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Milliez 1992</LINK> is of concern, there is not enough good quality evidence to determine whether this aspect of the Kapandji method is appropriate.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Only a few and provisional conclusions relating to clinical management can be drawn from the available randomised trials.</P>
<P>For dorsally displaced fractures, across-fracture percutaneous pinning helps to maintain reduced positions and thereby reduce deformity and malunion compared with plaster cast immobilisation alone. There is limited evidence that its use improves function. Complications are usually minor and, to some extent, avoidable. However, uncertainty remains about the indications for percutaneous pinning, the best technique to employ, and the extent and duration of immobilisation. Kapandji pinning, involving the support rather than fixation of the distal fracture fragment, appears to be associated with a less favourable outcome, particularly an excess of probable iatrogenic complications. More recent refinements of this technique have yet to be evaluated. There was some evidence of an excess of complications which, coupled with the extra demands at surgery, are likely to outweigh the putative advantages - avoidance of metal wire extraction and the associated risk of damage - of biodegradable pins.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given that a distal radius fracture in adults is a common injury and given that there is very limited knowledge about the best method of treatment, either conservative or surgical, further research is called for (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). However, rather than embark on yet more small single centre trials, particularly those with inadequate methodology that are unlikely to provide the good quality generalisable evidence required, the identification of the priority questions for the management of these fractures is required (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003d</LINK>). The updating of the evidence summaries for other surgical interventions of these fractures is likely to inform this process.</P>
