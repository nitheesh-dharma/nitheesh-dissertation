Background sentences are not correct and have been removed. They are not really relevant to this review about interfaces anyway. &amp;quot;Auto-CPAP, bilevel-PAP, patient titration, humidification and patient education have not been demonstrated in an unselected patient population to clearly improve compliance. However, there may be certain subgroups of patients who will benefit from such interventions, e.g. auto-CPAP may be useful in patients who have been previously identified as being poor compliers or who require higher CPAP pressures.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;2. The sentence about paucity of studies in the discussion sentence has been modified in the light of peer reviewer feedback in relation to the difficulty in carrying out these studies. (New version in red).&lt;br&gt;This review is now ready for submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing June 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a well written review and is almost ready to send for peer review. Well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Liz checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: I cannot tell how the GIV data has been entered but the graph labels do not seem to always match the direction of effect (first intervention should be on the left for adverse interventions and to the right for beneficial ones). Please could authors or Toby check data entry and labels to comply with this. For example ESS seems to vary in direction and I think may be wrong in comparisons 1 and 3?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Reads well but 310 words seems rather long. Can it be shortened by taking out some of the background description?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Fine. I have added significant in a couple of places (in red)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results : fine. I have not checked all the CI resutls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion : fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done p changed to P throughout and some typos amended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to authors to check metaview labels and shorten synopis. Then this can go for peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==================================&lt;br&gt;Liz Arnold has approved the search strtaegy (210105)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROTOCOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing by CJC 27 Jan 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers Contributions: This section of the cover sheet is blank. It is the third tab on the reviewers part and needs to be completed to say who will carry out the tasks of the review please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine but I have taken out compliance from the objective as this is the main outcome to be measured. Will the same machine need to be used with different interfaces in the trials? If not this is a source of confounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: I think this section needs a little more work. I do not find the lumped score from Jadad very informative and suggest that most trials will not be blind so can you tease out the major threats to validity that you would worry about and use these to assess quality. &lt;br&gt;If you plan to calculate NNT you need to say how you will do it in advance, e.g. &amp;quot;Numbers needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to the risk in the placebo group using an online calculator (Visual Rx at www.nntonline.net). This calculator converts the risk in the placebo group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the tiotropium group, converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Crossover trial data will need to be combined using the Generic Inverse Variance method in RevMAn.&lt;br&gt;Any subgroup analysis must be prespecified and kept to a small number of baseline factors.&lt;br&gt;Senstivity analysis on the basis of trial quality should be mentioned.&lt;br&gt;Funnel plot for publication bias would also be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Toby please return to authors for attention to the above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-26 11:35:29 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="DEL-SLP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.3 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Continuous positive airway pressure delivery interfaces for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition whereby patients experience obstruction of their airways and develop an irregular breathing pattern during their sleep. If untreated, OSA can cause a variety of health problems, including high blood pressure, heart problems, difficulty concentrating, excessive sleepiness and an increased risk of having a motor vehicle accident. One widely recommended form of treatment for OSA is CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which consists of a pump which blows air into a patient's nose and/or mouth during sleep to hold open the airways and stop obstructions from occurring. The pump is connected to the patient via a connecting hose and an "interface" which rests on the patient's face. There are many different types of interface available for CPAP use, including masks which cover the nose, the mouth, both the nose and mouth, and even the entire face. Unfortunately, patients will often experience side effects related to their interface, which may make them want to stop their CPAP treatment. This review compares the different interface options for CPAP in patients with OSA. Four trials involving 132 people were included. Two studies compared nasal masks with an oral mask called the Oracle, and there did not appear to any significant differences between the two in terms of compliance, sleep study recordings, sleepiness or other symptoms of OSA. One study assessing nasal masks versus nasal pillows (consisting of prongs that rest within the nostrils) showed that patients using the nasal pillows had fewer overall side effects and reported greater satisfaction. The nose mask performed better than the face mask (which covers both the nose and mouth) with one study showing greater compliance and less sleepiness, and was the preferred mask in almost all patients. The choice of interface for a particular person will need to be tailored to the individual. Further trials comparing the many interfaces for CPAP in the treatment of OSA are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with CPAP has been less than ideal. There are many different CPAP interfaces now available for the treatment of OSA. The type of CPAP delivery interface is likely to influence a patient's acceptance of CPAP therapy and long term compliance. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 11:35:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Four trials involving 132 people were included. Two studies compared nasal mask with the Oracle oral mask and showed no significant difference in compliance at one month (mean difference (MD) 0.17 hours per night, 95%CI 0.54 to 0.87). There were also no significant differences in any of the physiological parameters (e.g. AHI, arousal index, minimum oxygen saturation), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), or symptoms of OSA. A single study comparing nasal mask with nasal pillows showed a significant difference in compliance when expressed as the percentage of days used in favour of nasal pillows (nasal pillows mean 94.1± SD 8.3%; nasal mask 85.7 ± 23.5%, P = 0.02), however there were no significant differences in the mean daily use for all days or when use was greater than 0 minutes per day. Nasal pillows were also associated with fewer overall adverse effects (P &lt; 0.001) and greater interface satisfaction (P = 0.001). One study comparing nasal mask with face mask showed that compliance was significantly greater with use of a nasal mask (MD 1.0 hour per night,95% CI 0.3 to 1.8). Nasal mask was also associated with significantly lower ESS scores and was the preferred interface in almost all patients.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 11:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Due to the limited number of studies available comparing various interface types, the optimum form of CPAP delivery interface remains unclear. The results of our review suggest that nasal pillows or the Oracle oral mask may be useful alternatives when a patient is unable to tolerate conventional nasal masks. The face mask can not be recommended as a first line interface, but may be considered if nasal obstruction or dryness limits the use of a nasal mask. Further randomised studies comparing the different forms of CPAP delivery interface now available for the treatment of OSA, in larger groups of patients and for longer durations, are required.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-26 11:32:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-06-26 11:32:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypopnoea and apnoea during sleep, as a result of repetitive obstruction of the upper airways. The resulting airflow limitation leads to oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Clinically, patients will present with loud snoring, daytime hyper somnolence and cognitive impairment, and, if untreated, is associated with increased risk of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Peppard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peppard 2000</LINK>), cardiovascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Shahar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahar 2001</LINK>), motor vehicle accidents (<LINK REF="REF-Barbe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbe 1998</LINK>) and premature death. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnoea syndrome has been estimated to be 4% in middle-aged men and 2% in middle-aged women (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which acts as a pneumatic splint to maintain patency within the upper airways during sleep, is the mainstay of therapy for patients with moderate to severe OSA. It has been shown to reduce symptoms of daytime somnolence, improve ventilatory parameters and is associated with enhanced quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Engleman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engleman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jenkinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkinson 1999</LINK>). Unfortunately, compliance with CPAP has been less than ideal, with studies showing adherence rates ranging from 46 to 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Kribbs-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kribbs 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pepin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Various interface options are available for CPAP delivery, including nasal masks, oronasal masks, oral masks, total face masks and nasal pillows. The type of interface prescribed is likely to influence a patient's acceptance of CPAP therapy and compliance with the treatment. Adherence to CPAP will be affected by the occurrence of side effects such as claustrophobia, air leaks, pressure sores, nasal stuffiness, dry mouth, and mask discomfort. A study by <LINK REF="REF-Pepin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 1995</LINK> in patients using nasal CPAP showed that 50% of patients experienced at least one side effect related to the use of their mask. Different interface designs for CPAP have been developed over the years in an effort to minimise the occurrence of such adverse effects and to improve compliance. Other interventions to improve compliance have been tried and previously reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). The type of CPAP delivery interface is likely to influence a patient's acceptance of CPAP therapy and long term compliance. Our review, therefore, aims to evaluate the relative compliance benefits of a range of CPAP interfaces.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 09:14:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We pooled data with Review Manager software. </P>
<P>Due to the small number of studies which fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review, our ability to pool data for meta analyses was limited. A generic inverse variance approach was used to combine data when studies included cross-over trials.</P>
<P>The following statistical considerations were planned prior to conducting the review, but could not be applied due to the limited number of studies included:</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, a meta analysis was to be performed using pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. A chi-squared test for statistical heterogeneity was to be performed, with trial data considered heterogenous if P &lt; 0.1. Homogenous data was to be pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was demonstrated, data would be analysed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.</P>
<P>A weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals was to be calculated for continuous data which were measured on the same scale. Continuous data that were measured on different scales were to be calculated as a standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effect model was to be used, unless significant heterogeneity was found, in which a random-effects model was to be used.</P>
<P>Numbers needed to treat (NNT) was to be calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% confidence interval applied to the risk in the inferior interface group using the online calculator Visual Rx (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). This programme will convert the risk in the inferior interface group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the superior interface group, converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>The number of participants in each study ranged from 20 to 42 patients. Participants were recruited from hospital-based sleep laboratories in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>). The recruitment setting was not described in the remaining two studies. The diagnosis of OSA was confirmed on the basis of results of polysomnography in all studies, and therapeutic CPAP pressures were determined using split-night polysomnography or full-night CPAP titration. Participants from all of the studies had received a new diagnosis of OSA and/or had never received prior treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. The inclusion criteria specified a baseline apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of at least 15 in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>), and at least 20 in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>). The high mean AHI reported by the studies, ranging from 34 to 82 events per hour, indicated that most participants suffered from a severe degree of OSA. There appeared to be a predominance of males in the two studies that had reported on gender (<LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>). The mean age of participants in the studies varied from 46 to 52 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) reported by the studies ranged from 32 to 43, indicating that a large number of participants were obese.</P>

<I>Types of interventions</I>
</B>
<BR/>Two studies compared nasal masks with a novel oral mask (Oracle) for the delivery of CPAP in patients with OSA (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>). The Oracle is a strapless butterfly-shaped interface made from silicone which rests between the lips and teeth. It also has a "snap-flap" which lies over the lips and cheeks to achieve a seal, as well as a tongue guide to prevent the tongue from being displaced posteriorly and causing occlusion of the oral cavity. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>) performed a comparison of nasal pillows versus a nasal mask. <LINK REF="STD-Mortimore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimore 1998</LINK> compared nose mask and face mask CPAP therapy. Three of the studies used CPAP machines with integrated heated humidification in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>). In two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>) follow-up telephone calls were conducted at various times during the study to address issues of mask discomfort and to provide ongoing support.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Compliance with CPAP was reported as a major outcome in all of the studies. Three of the studies recorded the hours of use per night, measured as the run-time from the hour counter meter on the CPAP machine (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimore 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK> measured compliance using a pressure transducer which recorded use only when the patient was breathing with the mask in place. Physiological data was reported in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK> presented physiological variables recorded by polysomnography at baseline, on nasal CPAP and on oral CPAP, including arousal index, apnoea-hypopnoea index, sleep efficiency and minimum oxygen saturation. <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK> reported only the apnoea-hypopnoea index , which was recorded on the CPAP machine used by each participant. All studies assessed adverse effects associated with CPAP usage. However, the types of adverse effects reported were highly variable between studies, as were the scales used by each study group to rate each of these. The more commonly assessed side effects included dry mouth, dry nose, nasal congestion, gum pain, air leaks and claustrophobia. Mask preference was reported by two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimore 1998</LINK>). The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>) assessed overall satisfaction with interface type. All studies assessed the degree of daytime somnolence using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Symptoms of OSA, sleep quality and functional outcomes were reported by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>) using various rating scales.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has examined the evidence from four randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of various interface options for CPAP in obstructive sleep apnoea. Two of the studies compared nasal mask with an oral mask (Oracle), one study assessed nasal mask versus nasal pillows, and the other study compared nasal mask with face mask. </P>
<P>When nasal mask was compared with the oral mask (Oracle), no statistically significant difference could be found between the two interfaces in terms of compliance at one month, polysomnographic variables, total adverse effect scores, mask preference and Epworth Sleepiness Scale or symptoms of OSA. The nasal mask was associated with more frequent reports of excessive pressure from the mask or straps, air leaks and mask dislodgement. On the other hand, oral mask use was limited by complaints of dry mouth and throat, excessive salivation and sore lips or gums. A non-randomised study comparing the Oracle oral interface with conventional nasal &amp; oronasal masks was conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Beecroft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beecroft 2003</LINK> and allowed patients to self-select the type of interface that they wished to use with their CPAP machine. In this study, 27% of patients selected the Oracle mask as their preferred interface, compared to 66% who chose a nasal mask, and 7% who chose an oronasal mask. The Oracle mask was as effective as the nasal &amp; oronasal masks in controlling OSA, and scored similar subjective ratings for adherence, efficacy and mask comfort. The main limitations to its use were complaints of upper airway dryness &amp; "rain-out", whereby excess condensation collects within the CPAP tubing. The Oracle oral interface appears to be a useful alternative for patients who are unable to tolerate nasal CPAP.</P>
<P>The comparison between nasal mask and nasal pillows in a single study showed that the use of nasal pillows was associated with significantly greater compliance when expressed as the percentage of days used, fewer overall adverse effects and a greater degree of overall satisfaction with the interface. However, there appeared to be no statistically significant difference between nasal pillows and nasal mask when compliance was expressed as the mean daily use for all days or mean daily use for days with use greater than 0 minutes. There were also no significant differences seen in the AHI, Epworth Sleepiness scale and quality of life between the two interfaces. Nasal pillows are a viable alternative to nasal mask, and could even be offered as the first line of interface given the relative advantages for some outcomes.</P>
<P>A single study assessing the use of nasal mask versus full face mask showed that compliance was significantly greater with use of the nasal mask. Use of the nasal mask was also associated with a significantly lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale and was rated overall in the study as the preferred form of interface. The face mask was associated with more complaints of air leaks, red or sore eyes, claustrophobia and difficulty exhaling. Use of the nasal mask was associated with more frequent reports of dry throat, mouth and nose. The face mask can not be recommended as the initial therapeutic option. Rather, it may be best utilised where nasal obstruction or dryness limits the benefit of CPAP. The Oracle oral device may also be useful in this circumstance. The advantages and disadvantages of the four different types of interface, based on the findings of this review, have been summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>There is only limited reported evidence available addressing the efficacy of different interface options for CPAP in OSA. From the current literature, we were able to identify only a small number of studies, each with small numbers of participants. There is a paucity of studies assessing effectiveness and compliance in relation to the various CPAP interfaces, given the wide range of interface options that are currently on the market. For example, there are no randomised controlled trials reported comparing conventional masks to the newer "total face" mask (which covers the entire face, including the eyes). There is a need for further randomised controlled studies comparing the different forms of CPAP delivery interface that are now available for the treatment of OSA.</P>
<P>Participants in all four of the studies were newly diagnosed with OSA and, therefore, were CPAP naive. There is no data currently available which examines the impact of alternative CPAP interfaces in patients who have previously been intolerant to conventional masks to assess whether compliance rates can be improved. Further studies addressing this issue are required.</P>
<P>The high mean baseline AHI reported by the studies, ranging from 34 to 82 events per hour, indicate that the majority of patients had a severe degree of OSA. CPAP therapy is generally recommended for those with moderate to severe OSA, however, can also be useful in patients with mild forms of OSA who are symptomatic from their condition. A previous Cochrane review on CPAP in OSA showed a more pronounced effect of CPAP in patients who were more symptomatic, with an Epworth Sleepiness Score greater than 14 compared to those with an ESS less than 10, but showed no association between AHI and compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>). One study showed clinically significant improvements in sleepiness as well as in health and functional status with the use of CPAP in mild OSA (<LINK REF="REF-Engleman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engleman 1999</LINK>). However, it has been reported that patients with less severe forms of OSA and those who have a lack of subjective benefit from therapy are more likely to discontinue CPAP treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Janson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janson 2000</LINK>). The impact of different interfaces on compliance and patient preference in milder forms of disease requires further assessment.</P>
<P>All of the included studies assessed outcomes after relatively short treatment periods, ranging from three to eight weeks. Although <LINK REF="REF-Popescu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popescu 2001</LINK> suggested that a patient's behaviour in the first two weeks of therapy is a good indicator of their long term commitment, it is not entirely clear whether the results of these studies can be taken as an indicator of long term compliance. Studies of a more prolonged duration are needed to assess the long term outcomes and compliance rates associated with different interface types. </P>
<P>An important consideration in patient preference is the cost of the CPAP interface. Prices of the various interface options from an online CPAP retailer (www.talkaboutsleep.biz) were compared. Nasal masks appear to be the cheaper form of interface, ranging from US$69 (Fisher and Paykel Flexifit Nasal Mask) to US$129.95 (Resmed Ultra Mirage II). The price of nasal pillows range from US$89 (Puritan Bennett Breeze Nasal Pillows) to US$129 (Resmed Mirage Swift Nasal Pillows). The cost of the Fisher and Paykel Oracle 452 Oral Mask is US$115.95. Face masks appear to be the most expensive form of CPAP delivery interface, with costs ranging from US$119.95 (Fisher and Paykel Flexifit 431 Full Face Mask) to US$169 (Resmed Ultra Mirage Full Face Mask).</P>
<P>It became apparent whilst conducting this review that there was a lack of standardised measures for the reporting of outcomes such as adverse effects, symptoms and quality of life, which limited the opportunity for statistical comparisons to be made between studies. The use of standardised scales for these outcome measures would help to overcome these limitations.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Due to the paucity of randomised studies comparing different forms of CPAP interface, it is difficult to make any definite conclusions or recommendations as to which is the best. The large majority of studies evaluating the effectiveness of CPAP in the treatment of OSA have used nasal masks, and, therefore, these have emerged as the interface of first choice during CPAP titration studies. If a patient is unable to tolerate nasal CPAP, we would recommend trialling different forms of CPAP interface during CPAP titration, targeted to the individuals' face shape and body habitus, physiological parameters, side effects experienced, tolerance and overall preference. Results of this review suggest that nasal pillows or the Oracle oral interface are potentially useful alternatives when patients are unable to tolerate a nasal mask. Regular review of patients to address any issues related to the use of their CPAP machine and interface is necessary to ensure ongoing tolerance and compliance.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A wide range of new CPAP interfaces continue to be introduced onto the market and evidence of their effectiveness in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea is necessary. Further randomised, controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of different interface types with larger numbers of patients and for longer periods of time are required. Assessment of the impact of different interface options in milder forms of OSA and also in patients who have previously tried but have been intolerant of CPAP is also important. In addition, the use of standardised scales for outcome measures such as adverse effects, symptoms and quality of life would enable better statistical comparisons to be made between studies.</P>
