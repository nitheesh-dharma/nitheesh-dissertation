<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-09 12:13:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ewan McNicol">
<P>Neuropathic pain is pain caused by nerve damage. It is often difficult to diagnose and treat. The use of opioids (strong pain killers such as morphine) to treat neuropathic pain is controversial owing to concerns about addiction and beliefs that this type of pain does not always respond well to opioids. The review looked at short-term studies lasting less than a day and intermediate-term trials lasting from several days to 12 weeks. The 31 studies found involved 1237 people with neuropathic pain; most studies were small.</P>
<P>Short-term studies produced mixed results, with just over half indicating that opioids might be better than a placebo. While intermediate-term studies all indicated that opioids were better than placebo, most studies were small, most were short, and none used methods known to be unbiased. All these features are likely to make effects of opioids look better in clinical trials than they are in clinical practice. We cannot say whether opioids are better than placebo for neuropathic pain over the long term. Side effects such as constipation, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness were common, but not life-threatening.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2006, which included 23 trials. The use of opioids for neuropathic pain remains controversial.

<P>To reassess the efficacy and safety of opioid agonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-04 13:21:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL, on <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 10 of 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to Oct week 3, 2012), and EMBASE (1980 to 2012, week 42) for articles in any language, and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles. Searches were originally run in 2005, then again in 2010 and 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-13 13:52:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which opioid agonists were given to treat central or peripheral neuropathic pain of any etiology. Pain was assessed using validated instruments, and adverse events were reported. We excluded studies in which drugs other than opioid agonists were combined with opioids or opioids were administered epidurally or intrathecally.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-13 13:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and included demographic variables, diagnoses, interventions, efficacy, and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-13 13:53:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-one trials met our inclusion criteria, studying 10 different opioids: 23 studies from the original 2006 review and eight additional studies from this updated review.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies (392 participants with neuropathic pain, average 22 participants per study) provided efficacy data for acute exposure to opioids over less than 24 hours. Sixteen reported pain outcomes, with contradictory results; 8/16 reported less pain with opioids than placebo, 2/16 reported that some but not all participants benefited, 5/16 reported no difference, and 1/16 reported equivocal results. Six studies with about 170 participants indicated that mean pain scores with opioid were about 15/100 points less than placebo.</P>
<P>Fourteen studies (845 participants, average 60 participants per study) were of intermediate duration lasting 12 weeks or less; most studies lasted less than six weeks. Most studies used imputation methods for participant withdrawal known to be associated with considerable bias; none used a method known not to be associated with bias. The evidence, therefore, derives from studies predominantly with features likely to overestimate treatment effects, i.e. small size, short duration, and potentially inadequate handling of dropouts. All demonstrated opioid efficacy for spontaneous neuropathic pain. Meta-analysis demonstrated at least 33% pain relief in 57% of participants receiving an opioid versus 34% of those receiving placebo. The overall point estimate of risk difference was 0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.37, P &lt; 0.0001), translating to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4.0 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.7). When the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief was analyzed, the overall point estimate of risk difference between opioids (47%) and placebo (30%) was 0.17 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.33, P = 0.03), translating to an NNTB of 5.9 (3.0 to 50.0). In the updated review, opioids did not demonstrate improvement in many aspects of emotional or physical functioning, as measured by various validated questionnaires. Constipation was the most common adverse event (34% opioid versus 9% placebo: number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.0; 95% CI 3.0 to 5.6), followed by drowsiness (29% opioid versus 14% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 4.0 to 33.3), nausea (27% opioid versus 9% placebo: NNTH 6.3; 95% CI 4.0 to 12.5), dizziness (22% opioid versus 8% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 5.6 to 10.0), and vomiting (12% opioid versus 4% placebo: NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 6.7 to 100.0). More participants withdrew from opioid treatment due to adverse events (13%) than from placebo (4%) (NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 8.3 to 25.0). Conversely, more participants receiving placebo withdrew due to lack of efficacy (12%) versus (2%) receiving opioids (NNTH -11.1; 95% CI -20.0 to -8.3).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-30 13:54:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review, new studies were found providing additional information. Data were reanalyzed but the results did not alter any of our previously published conclusions. Short-term studies provide only equivocal evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing the intensity of neuropathic pain. Intermediate-term studies demonstrated significant efficacy of opioids over placebo, but these results are likely to be subject to significant bias because of small size, short duration, and potentially inadequate handling of dropouts. Analgesic efficacy of opioids in chronic neuropathic pain is subject to considerable uncertainty. 쟓eported adverse events of opioids were common but not life-threatening. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish unbiased estimates of long-term efficacy, safety (including addiction potential), and effects on quality of life.</P>

<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (Issue 3, 2006) on 'Opioids for neuropathic pain'.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-08 12:12:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The percentage of people suffering from neuropathic pain is unknown, but is estimated to be as high as 7% to 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>) in developed nations. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain (of which neuropathic pain is a subset) suggest that around 20% of both developed and undeveloped nations' populations are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2006</LINK>). Neuropathic pain may result from a large variety of insults to the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system, including trauma, inflammation, ischemia, and metabolic and neoplastic disorders. Common examples of peripheral neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy and postsurgical neuralgia. Central neuropathic pain includes central post-stroke pain, pain in multiple sclerosis, and pain after spinal cord injury. The main clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain are continuous or intermittent spontaneous pain, typically described as burning, aching, or shooting in quality, and abnormal sensitivity of the painful site to normally innocuous stimuli such as light touch by garments, running water, or even wind (allodynia) (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maier 2010</LINK>). Neuropathic pain, like many other forms of chronic pain, often has negative effects on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer_x002d_Rosberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer-Rosberg 2001</LINK>). Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain has generally involved the use of antidepressants or anticonvulsants, but even with the current generation of these drugs, effective analgesia is achieved in less than half of this population (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-08 12:13:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opioids are the most effective broad-spectrum analgesics available and are considered the cornerstone of therapy for moderate-to-severe acute pain or pain of similar intensity due to life-threatening illnesses, but their long-term use in non-cancer pain, of which neuropathic pain is a component, is controversial. In the United States, the therapeutic use of opioids in general has risen significantly over the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Manchikanti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manchikanti 2008</LINK>). Despite this, the safety and efficacy of the different opioids in the treatment of neuropathic pain have yet to be established. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of opioids for reducing neuropathic pain have been reported for more than 25 years, yet great variability in trial design in terms of the type of neuropathic pain syndrome treated, the type of opioid administered, and the duration of treatment has yielded contradictory results. Studies that have suggested efficacy have used small study populations, raising questions about the validity of the results.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:11:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opioids provide analgesia by binding to opioid receptors of the mu and kappa class and blocking the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P. Opioid receptors are expressed both centrally and peripherally during the inflammatory response in injured tissue.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-08 13:09:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing neuropathic pain in general, and central neuropathic pain in particular. Equally, there are concerns about tolerability of opioids and the potential for abuse, addiction, hormonal abnormalities, dysfunction of the immune system, and, in some cases, paradoxical hyperalgesia with long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Rhodin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhodin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seghal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seghal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tompkin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tompkin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallejo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallejo 2004</LINK>). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</P>

<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this review if opioid agonists (but not partial agonists or agonist-antagonists) were given to treat central or peripheral neuropathic pain of any etiology.

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-09 12:16:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ewan McNicol">
<P>We included studies in which one or more opioid agonists or different doses of the same opioid agonist were compared with placebo, each other, or another class of medication used for neuropathic pain (e.g. antidepressants). We included studies in which drugs were administered by any of the following routes: oral, rectal, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous.</P>
<P>We excluded studies in which: drugs other than opioid agonists were combined with opioids (e.g. codeine with acetaminophen); opioids were administered epidurally or intrathecally, as the epidural route is usually reserved for postoperative/labor pain, and while the intrathecal route is used in neuropathic pain (usually via an implantable pump) such therapy is typically classified as neuro-modulation rather than analgesia; or if tramadol or tapentadol were used as the active drug, because, although both interact to some degree with opioid receptors, they are not regarded as pure opioid agonists. The efficacy of tramadol in relieving neuropathic pain has been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Duehmke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duehmke 2006</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2013-08-08 12:47:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our updated review the primary outcomes we sought were the proportion of participants reporting at least 33% pain reduction from baseline or 50% or more pain reduction from baseline. The selection of these outcomes, as opposed to the primary outcomes in our original review (mean pain intensity difference or mean pain relief) was based on the observation that pain relief tends to be bimodal, rendering mean values less useful. A greater than or equal to 33% (or &#8805; 30%) pain reduction from baseline was based upon analyses demonstrating that such a reduction was required for people with chronic pain to perceive a clinically meaningful change in pain intensity (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>). More recent evidence suggests that at least 50% pain relief is clinically significant, because high levels of pain relief are strongly associated with improved fatigue, sleep, depression, work ability and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>). While such data are rarely reported in older studies, we anticipated that those studies found in our updated search would report them.</P>
<P>Where studies did not report numbers of participants with at least 33% or 50% improvement, but reported numbers of participants reporting certain categories of global impression of change, e.g. "much improved", we translated these categories to equate to either at least 33% pain reduction from baseline or at least 50% pain reduction from baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We normalized pain intensity data assessed by means other than a 0 - 100 VAS to such a scale. To do so we either multiplied the original scale employed by an appropriate factor (e.g. by ten if the original scale was a 0 - 10 scale) or by assigning values on a 0 - 100 scale that corresponded to choices on the original assessment scale. For example, if a participant was offered a five-point scale, selection of the third point was scored as 50 on a 0 - 100 scale (0 = no pain, 1 = 25, 2 = 50, 3 = 75, 4 = 100).</P>

The review authors made critical assessments for each of the following domains: sequence generation (randomization), allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting.

<P>In contrast to our original review, we applied a random-effects model to combine data, in part because of the heterogeneity apparent in many of the analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>Discrete events such as numbers of participants reporting 33% pain relief or better, or 50% pain relief or better, or the number of participants reporting adverse events were used to calculate the risk difference using Review Manager 5 software.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-08-09 11:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We evaluated heterogeneity between and within trials using both the Chi test and the I test. The Chi test assesses whether observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone. A low P value (or a large Chi statistic relative to its degrees of freedom) provides evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects (variation in effect estimates beyond chance). The Chi test has low power in estimating heterogeneity in the common situation where few trials are analyzed or where included trials have small sample sizes. Although a statistically significant result may indicate a problem with heterogeneity, a non-significant result is not necessarily evidence of lack of heterogeneity. Methods developed for quantifying inconsistency across studies that move the focus away from testing whether heterogeneity is present to assessing its impact on the meta-analysis include the I statistic. I = [(Q -df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the Chi statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I statistic describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).

<P>We divided the trials into two categories according to study duration. There is no definition per se of what constitutes a short-term or an intermediate-term trial. Short-term trials, intuitively, were those that employed a single dose or intravenous infusion intervention. We labeled other trials as 'intermediate-term' because we did not consider trial duration to be sufficiently long to make firm conclusions about chronic administration of opioids. In total, our updated review included 17 short-term studies (three from the 2005 - 2012 searches) and 14 intermediate-term studies (five from the 2005 - 2012 search).</P>
<P>Eight of the 28 retrieved articles from the updated search (2010, 2012) met the inclusion criteria and provided data on an additional 510 participants with neuropathic pain who were treated with opioids. Three studies were short-term trials: <LINK REF="STD-Juarez_x002d_Pichardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Juarez-Pichardo 2009</LINK> (N = 27); <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2007</LINK> (N = 79); and <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2006</LINK> (N = 32).

First, an RCT conducted over seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>) compared morphine with placebo in a mixed group of participants with various neuropathic and nociceptive pain syndromes. The authors reported that "the number of responders was significantly higher in patients with neuropathic than with nociceptive pain". However, efficacy and adverse event data were not presented separately for the different types of pain. Second, a short-term, placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kalman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalman 2002</LINK>) showed that only four of 14 participants who had multiple sclerosis and central neuropathic pain were categorized as 'responders' to intravenous morphine. The study was non-randomized and single blinded. Third, in an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 1998</LINK>), five different doses of buprenorphine (0.033 to 0.166 mg) were administered randomly to 21 participants with post-thoracotomy neuropathic pain one month after surgery, with reduction of pain by 50% in each person. However, buprenorphine is a partial mu receptor agonist, with different pharmacological properties to members of the full  opioid agonist class.</P>
<P>Twenty studies were excluded from the updated search (2005 - 2012). Three trials included participants in whom pain could not be attributed entirely to neuropathic origin: in two of them participants with acute herpes zoster were enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2007</LINK>
<B>; </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Dworkin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dworkin 2009</LINK>); and the third consisted of participants with low back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Kalso-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 2007</LINK>). The potential cause of pain in these participants can be nociceptive, neuropathic or both, and the effect of opioid treatment on the two types of pain was not reported separately. Similarly, six other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruciani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cruciani 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weil-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weil 2009</LINK>) were excluded because enrolled participants had mixed pain syndromes (neuropathic or nociceptive) and results were not presented independently.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Short-term studies</HEADING>
<P>Our updated search added two cross-over and one parallel study, which provided additional efficacy data for opioids in 125 participants with neuropathic pain. None of the three studies presented data in a format that we were able to add to our short-term study meta-analyses. In total, 17 RCTs provided efficacy data for acute exposure to opioids in 392 participants with neuropathic pain. In the three new studies, drugs were administered buccally (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2007</LINK>) and intravenously (<LINK REF="STD-Juarez_x002d_Pichardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Juarez-Pichardo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2006</LINK>). In total, drugs were administered intravenously in 14 trials, orally in one (<LINK REF="STD-Max-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1988</LINK>), intramuscularly in one (<LINK REF="STD-Rabben-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rabben 1999</LINK>) and buccally in one (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2007</LINK>). The duration of treatment varied from seconds (i.e. a single intramuscular injection) to eight hours, but was less than one hour in 10 trials. The tested drug was morphine in seven trials, alfentanil in four, fentanyl in two, and oxycodone, meperidine, codeine, or the investigational drug CJC-1008 (a chemical modification of the opioid peptide dynorphin A) in one trial each. Placebo was used as a control in 14 trials. The diagnosis was specified in all trials: four trials included people with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) only (<LINK REF="STD-Eide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2006</LINK>); two involved people with post-traumatic neuralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Jorum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jorum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK>); in seven, participants with mixed neuropathies were studied (<LINK REF="STD-Arner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dellemijn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dellemijn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jadad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jadad 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juarez_x002d_Pichardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Juarez-Pichardo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-central" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 central</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-peripheral" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 peripheral</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2007</LINK>); two included people with central pain (<LINK REF="STD-Attal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eide-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1995</LINK>); one involved people with secondary (e.g. post-traumatic) trigeminal neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Rabben-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rabben 1999</LINK>); and one enrolled participants with postamputation stump and phantom pain (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-phantom-limb" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 phantom limb</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-stump" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 stump</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes assessed</HEADING>
<P>A change in spontaneous pain intensity was the primary outcome measure in 16 trials. Authors reported mixed results with respect to the analgesic efficacy of opioids for neuropathic pain in general and for specific conditions (i.e. PHN, post-traumatic neuralgia, and central pain). Eight trials showed greater efficacy of the tested opioid versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Dellemijn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dellemijn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eide-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jorum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-phantom-limb" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 phantom limb</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-stump" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 stump</LINK>) or another active intervention (tramadol, <LINK REF="STD-Juarez_x002d_Pichardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Juarez-Pichardo 2009</LINK>). In contrast, in five trials, researchers observed equivalent efficacy for opioids and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Arner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Attal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK>). Two trials demonstrated partial efficacy, meaning that some participants responded to the opioid treatment while others did not (<LINK REF="STD-Jadad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jadad 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabben-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rabben 1999</LINK>). Another trial showed a reduction in the affective but not in the sensory component of pain (<LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-central" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 central</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-peripheral" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 peripheral</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study, from our updated search, assessed breakthrough pain (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2007</LINK>). Fentanyl tablets or placebo were administered buccally to treat nine consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain in each of 79 participants with mixed neuropathies. Drug efficacy was measured for up to 120 minutes for each episode. This study also differed from the other short-term studies in that participants had up to 21 days to complete the nine separate assessments. Because of the unique study design, we were not able to combine data from this study with data from any of the other short-term studies. The study demonstrated statistically significant superiority of fentanyl buccal tablets over placebo for several outcomes, including summed pain intensity over 60 minutes, SPID60 (mean (standard error), 9.63 (0.75) versus 5.73 (0.72), respectively; P &lt; 0.001) and proportion of breakthrough episodes with a at least 33% and at least 50% improvement in pain intensity from baseline compared with placebo from 10 minutes (9% versus 3%; P = 0.008) through two hours (66% versus 37%; P &lt; 0.001).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>We combined data for meta-analysis from four studies enrolling a total of 90 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Attal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-central" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 central</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kupers-1991-peripheral" TYPE="STUDY">Kupers 1991 peripheral</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-phantom-limb" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 phantom limb</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002-stump" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002 stump</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The result of the Chi test for heterogeneity was 0.55 (P = 0.99), and the I was 0%, indicating homogeneity between and within studies. The overall mean difference in the last measured pain intensity for active treatment versus placebo was -16 (on a 0 - 100 visual analog scale (VAS)) (95% CI -23 to -9; P &lt; 0.00001). We were able to conduct a subanalysis based on origin of neuropathic pain. Data from two trials including a total of 21 participants with central pain and from four trials involving 69 participants with peripheral neuropathic pain were subanalyzed (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). For peripheral pain, the final pain intensity following opioid administration was 15 points lower than that after placebo (95% CI -23 to -7; P = 0.0002), whereas, for central pain, the difference was 18 points (95% CI -30 to -5; P = 0.006).</P>
<P>When short-term studies were categorized according to etiology, e.g. post-traumatic neuralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Jorum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jorum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK>), PHN (<LINK REF="STD-Eide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 1991</LINK>), the results were equivocal. One within-study comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Jadad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jadad 1992</LINK>) and two other between-study comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Jorum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jorum 2003</LINK> versus <LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 1994</LINK> versus <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 1991</LINK>) of 'high' versus 'low' opioid doses did not show an association between the opioid dose administered and analgesic efficacy. Two trials reported results in terms of percentage reduction in pain (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK>). Meta-analysis of these two trials demonstrated an additional 26% reduction in pain for opioid versus placebo (95% CI 17 to 35; P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), although the total number of participants (N = 19) was low.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity Analysis</HEADING>
<P>Our two predetermined sensitivity analyses involved removing studies with fewer than 10 participants and removing cross-over studies. Only one study involved in the meta-analysis had fewer than 10 participants in a phase (<LINK REF="STD-Max-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1995</LINK>). Removing this study had minimal effect on the point estimate and no effect on statistical significance. All of the short-term studies involved in the meta-analyses employed a cross-over design, therefore sensitivity analysis by study design was not possible.</P>

<P>The results from the intermediate-term studies are summarized in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>Five trials from our updated search provided data on 385 participants with neuropathic pain treated with opioids (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>)<B>. </B>The number per treatment group ranged from 29 to 169 (median 50).

</P>
<P>When both the original and updated searches are combined, 14 trials provided data on 845 people treated with opioids. The number per treatment group ranged from 12 to 169 and the duration of treatment varied from eight days to 12 weeks. Nine trials had a cross-over design and five had a parallel design. Five drugs were tested: morphine in six trials, oxycodone in five trials; methadone in one article comprising two trials; and levorphanol and dihydrocodeine in one trial each. Daily doses ranged from less than 5 mg to 300 mg of oral morphine equivalents, but were generally at the lower end of this range. Placebo was used as a control in all but two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>). Five trials, in addition to opioid and placebo, included at least one arm/phase where participants received an active control or combination of interventions: carbamazepine in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Harke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harke 2001</LINK>), mexiletine (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>

<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> also included a fourth arm of nortriptyline plus morphine. While many studies allowed participants to continue with any non-opioid drug from their existing regimen, two trials specifically combined an active drug with the opioid and/or the placebo: pregabalin (<LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>) and gabapentin (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>). Two trials compared different dosages of an opioid: methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2003</LINK>) and levorphanol (<LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>). Eight trials enrolled participants with one specific pain syndrome: diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2003</LINK>), PHN (<LINK REF="STD-Raja-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Raja 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1998</LINK>), chronic lumbar root pain (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome - proportion of participants reporting &#8805; 33% pain reduction from baseline or &#8805; 50% pain reduction from baseline</HEADING>
<P>The more recent studies presented data in a format that allowed us to analyze the number of participants with at least 33% and at least 50% pain relief. For the former, 208 of 367 participants (57%) receiving an opioid achieved at least 33% relief, versus 122 of 360 participants receiving placebo (34%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The overall point estimate of risk difference was 0.25 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.37, P &lt; 0.0001), translating to an NNTB of 4.0 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.7) There was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.02, I = 63%), which was caused by the much larger risk differences (greater efficacy of opioids) in <LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1998</LINK> in comparison with the other studies. When these studies were removed from the analysis, heterogeneity disappeared, leaving the overall point estimate of risk difference as 0.17 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.25, P &lt; 0.0001), translating to an NNTB of 5.9 (95% CI 4.0 to 11.1). When number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief was analyzed, the overall point estimate of risk difference was 0.17 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.33, P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), translating to an NNTB of 5.9 (3.0 to 50.0). Both the overall numbers of participants and the percentages achieving at least 50% pain relief were lower, with 72 of 154 (47%) participants receiving opioid versus 46 of 151 (30%) participants receiving placebo achieving at least 50% pain relief. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>) demonstrated a tendency towards a greater number of participants in the <I>placebo</I> group achieving at least 50% pain relief. When this study was removed, the overall point estimate of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.36) in favor of those receiving an opioid, translated to an NNTB of 4.5 (95% CI 2.8 to 11.1) . A smaller number of studies assessed the number of participants with at least 33% or at least 50% pain relief when comparing opioid with an active control (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK> compared an opioid with gabapentin, a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline), or an antiarrythmic (mexiletine), respectively. Only the last of these demonstrated a statistically significant difference between interventions, with morphine being superior to mexiletine when comparing the number of participants with both at least 33% pain relief (RD = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.48: NNTB = 3.6; 95% CI 2.1 to 12.5) and at least 50% pain relief (RD = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39: NNTB = 5.0; 95% CI 2.6 to 100.0). Numbers of participants were low in this study, with 50 receiving morphine and 42 mexiletine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Pain intensity post-intervention</HEADING>
<P>Two studies from our updated search (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>) added data to our 2005 analysis of pain intensity post-intervention, comparing opioid and placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Therefore, nine of the 14 studies provided data suitable for pooling. The meta-analysis now includes 374 opioid-treated and 351 placebo-treated participants and shows the overall mean pain intensity to be 12 points lower in opioid-treated participants than in those treated with placebo (95% CI -15 to -9; P &lt; 0.00001). The addition of the two studies from our updated search (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>) made a negligible difference to the statistical significance or point estimate. Additionally, the same two studies added data to our analysis comparing mean VAS pain scores for opioids versus active controls (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). As with comparisons of the number of participants with specified percentages of pain relief, only the comparison of morphine versus mexiletine (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>) demonstrated statistically significant superiority: those receiving morphine had a 13 point lower pain intensity post-intervention (P &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI; -19 to -7). Again, the total number of participants was low.</P>
<P>Evoked pain data that we could meta-analyze were reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2003</LINK>), with low overall numbers of participants. In both these trials oxycodone was significantly superior to placebo in reducing allodynia, categorized as 'skin pain' (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). When the studies were combined statistically, participants receiving oxycodone had a 24 point lower score (95% CI: -34 to -13, P &lt; 0.0001) on a 0 - 100 VAS.</P>
<P>We found a dose-dependent analgesic effect in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>) that included people with mixed neuropathies. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2003</LINK>), 'low' and 'high' doses of methadone were each compared separately with placebo; the higher dose produced a greater effect than the lower dose. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>), a direct comparison showed that a higher dose of levorphanol produced a significantly greater analgesic effect than the lower dose. The use of different outcome measures in the two studies precluded the performance of a dose-response meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of life and functioning</HEADING>
<P>Many of the trials measured the effects of opioids on emotional and physical functioning. However, because of the use of multiple measurement tools and differences in the way data were presented, only very limited meta-analysis with low participant numbers was possible. Several studies compared opioid versus placebo for post-intervention results in both the physical and mental health components of the Short Form-36 (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>), including three studies from the updated search. The studies reported mixed results; however only two reported data in a format that enabled us to perform meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>). From these, only the sub scale 'bodily pain' demonstrated marginal superiority of opioid versus placebo, with those receiving morphine reporting a seven-point improvement (95% CI: 0.1 to 13, <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). For those studies that also reported results for bodily pain, but in a format that we could not add to our meta-analysis, two did not show an improvement of opioid over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>), whereas <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2003</LINK> did report superiority. When comparing opioid versus active control, neither <LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> demonstrated significant differences for any subscales, other than <LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK> reporting an 11-point improvement in mental health for nortriptyline versus morphine (95% CI: 1 to 21) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Two studies comparing opioid with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>) demonstrated improvements in several aspects of the Brief Pain Inventory, both physical and emotional, with the greatest improvement over placebo occurring in sleep, where those receiving an opioid had a 1.7 point (on an 11-point scale) superiority over placebo (95% CI: -2.4 to -1.1, P &lt; 0.00001, <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Emotional functioning was measured by several questionnaires, including the Beck Depression Inventory and the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. We were able to meta-analyze data from the Beck Depression Inventory when comparing both opioid and placebo, and opioid with active controls. In both cases, meta-analysis did not demonstrate statistical differences between interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>), although mean scores in all groups were in the minimal to mild depression range (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). Similarly, no improvement was noted in the Profile of Mood States scores of those with mixed neuropathies treated with two different dosages of levorphanol (<LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>) nor in the Rand Mental Health Inventory completed by people with diabetic neuropathy following oxycodone treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events or lack of efficacy</HEADING>
<P>As with our 2005 review, we extracted data on the incidence of common opioid-related adverse events from all intermediate-term studies comparing opioids with placebo. In addition, for our updated review, we analyzed adverse events when comparing opioids with active controls and divided participant withdrawals into two categories: those due to adverse events and those due to lack of efficacy, although it could be argued that both denote failure of therapy. Finally, as noted above, we used a random-effects model, as opposed to the fixed-effect model employed in our original review.</P>
<P>All but one of the intermediate-term studies from our updated search contributed data for meta-analysis: <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2008</LINK> counted each incidence of an adverse event, rather than the number of participants reporting. From our original review, <LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK> reported adverse events on a VAS, precluding determination of the numbers of affected participants, and <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK> compared two different doses of the opioid levorphanol; consequently their data could not be combined with other studies. The new studies approximately double the available participants ('N') for each analysis, increasing our confidence in their results. Although overall point estimates remained similar, the increased overall numbers meant that three of the comparisons for opioid versus placebo changed from non-statistically significant to significant (dizziness, drowsiness and vomiting).</P>
<P>The incidence of common adverse events in both opioid and placebo groups remained similar after including the new data: constipation was the most common (34% opioid versus 9% placebo: NNTH 4.0; 95% CI 3.0 to 5.6), followed by drowsiness (29% opioid versus 14% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 4.0 to 33.3), nausea (27% opioid versus 9% placebo: NNTH 6.3; 95% CI 4.0 to 12.5), dizziness (22% opioid versus 8% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 5.6 to 10.0), and vomiting (12% opioid versus 4% placebo: NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 6.7 to 100.0) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). Data on cognitive impairment as well as on other adverse events were insufficient to allow calculation of the NNTH.</P>
<P>Our new analysis of adverse event rates for opioid versus active interventions generally demonstrated non-statistically significant differences between treatments; however, both constipation (38% opioid versus 9% control: NNTH 3.4; 95% CI 2.6 to 4.8) and drowsiness (23% opioid versus 9% control: NNTH 7.7; 95% CI 5.0 to 16.7) occurred more frequently with opioids (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>When opioid therapy is initiated, recipients may abandon treatment because of either adverse events or lack of efficacy. In our updated analysis, more participants withdrew from opioid treatment due to adverse events than from placebo, with 55 (13%) of 435 participants in seven studies withdrawing during opioid therapy versus 18 (4%) of 432 receiving placebo (NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 8.3 to 25.0) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>). Conversely, more participants receiving placebo withdrew due to lack of efficacy, with eight of 363 (2%) participants receiving opioid withdrawing versus 42 of 360 (12%) receiving placebo (NNTH -11.1; 95% CI -20.0 to -8.3) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>). Only one study compared withdrawal rates between opioid and an active control, nortriptyline, and did not show a statistically significant difference in rates due to either adverse events or lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the Chi and I tests for each adverse event analyzed suggested that heterogeneity existed amongst results. This may have been due to genuine differences in event rates, differences in study populations, or as a result of authors using different measurements or thresholds for reporting adverse events. In most cases, removal of one outlying study from each analysis substantially reduced heterogeneity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity Analysis</HEADING>
<P>As with the short-term studies, our two predetermined sensitivity analyses involved removing studies with fewer than 10 participants and removing cross-over studies. None of the intermediate-term studies had fewer than 10 participants in an individual arm or phase. All of the studies comparing opioid with active control in our meta-analysis employed a cross-over design; therefore sensitivity analysis of such studies was not possible. The majority of studies contributing data to our comparisons of opioid versus placebo also had a cross-over design. Only five studies employed a parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK> did not contribute data to our analysis. In the few comparisons where there were sufficient numbers of both parallel and cross-over studies, removal of cross-over studies generally had only small effects on the point estimates of efficacy or safety, and in no cases did statistically significant overall estimates become non-significant. Equally, the difference in overall estimates between cross-over and parallel studies was small and did not consistently show more favorable results with cross-over studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-13 13:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review can be divided into two categories according to the duration of included trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Short-term studies</HEADING>
<P>Short-term trials demonstrated mixed results with respect to the analgesic efficacy of opioids. Our updated search did not yield any new studies suitable for statistical analysis. Although our meta-analysis showed an overall mean difference in the last measured pain intensity for short-term active treatment versus placebo of -16 points (on a 0 - 100 visual analog scale (VAS)), the result should be interpreted with caution because it is based on only six of 17 studies (and only 90 of 392 participants). Thus, our conclusion regarding this category of studies has not changed from our previous meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intermediate-term studies</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>In contrast, intermediate-term trials demonstrated consistent opioid analgesic efficacy in reducing spontaneous neuropathic pain that was almost entirely statistically significant when results were pooled, although studies were small, mostly short, and potentially dealt inadequately with data once participants withdrew from treatment. Our updated review added data to our original analyses, increasing confidence in their findings, but also introduced new outcome analyses, i.e. number of participants with at least 33% and 50% reduction and assessments of functioning, which are considered clinically important in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). Intermediate-term studies are more clinically relevant than short-term studies because they assess the benefits and risks associated with opioid treatments for weeks to months, i.e. they reflect how opioids are administered for neuropathic pain in clinical practice. This part of the meta-analysis was based on most of the available trials and included the majority of participants. Hence, we conclude that intermediate-term opioid treatment has a beneficial effect over placebo for spontaneous neuropathic pain as measured by both number of participants with at least 33% and at least 50% pain relief and in mean differences in post-intervention pain intensity. Opioids did not demonstrate improvement in many aspects of emotional or physical functioning, as measured by various validated questionnaires. This raises the concern that improvements in pain relief are not accompanied by similar improvements in activities of daily living or quality of life. It should be noted, however, that our meta-analyses of functioning included few studies, with low overall numbers of participants.</P>
<P>When comparing opioids with active controls, only the comparison of morphine with the rarely used antiarrythmic mexiletine demonstrated superiority of opioid (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>), with other comparisons not showing statistically significant differences between treatments. This may be due to opioids genuinely having similar efficacy to other interventions, or it may simply be a result of low participant numbers. Indirect comparisons with meta-analyses of other treatments for neuropathic pain offer limited clarification. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK> compared gabapentin with placebo for several similar efficacy outcomes. While the numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTBs) are similar for at least 50% pain relief and 33% pain relief (defined as 'moderate' relief in <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), placebo rates are much higher in the opioid analyses. Equally, participants in the gabapentin analyses often required the maximum daily dose (3600 mg), whereas in the opioid studies a larger effect was achieved by a low to moderate dose of opioid. Moreover, the dose-dependent analgesic effects shown in two of the opioid studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2003</LINK>) have not been confirmed by further trials; it is therefore unclear if high doses of opioids produce a greater magnitude of pain reduction in people with neuropathic pain. Thus, we are unable to confirm the commonly held belief that opioids have no ceiling effect in this population. This may be particularly important in light of recent concerns regarding mortality risk associated with high opioid dose regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Gomes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Safety</HEADING>
<P>Our assessment of safety did not find data related to serious adverse events, including mortality, most likely because of the relative rarity of such events, especially with low-to-moderate doses of opioids. Instead, we were able to analyze data related to relatively common, widely identified opioid-induced adverse events. Not surprisingly, and in agreement with our earlier review, many of the most commonly recognized opioid side effects occurred more frequently in those treated with opioid than with placebo. Conversely, there were few statistically significant differences between opioids and active controls, which may be due to controls having similar side-effect profiles, or to the small participant numbers for each comparison. However, constipation and drowsiness did appear to occur more commonly. In placebo-controlled studies, 13% of participants withdrew from opioid therapy due to adverse events, and 2% due to lack of efficacy. While these percentages are not particularly high, most of the study durations were less than eight weeks; therefore numbers may increase over longer periods. Additionally, the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not clearly address the issues of addiction and abuse. The absence of any report of addictive behavior or abuse in any of the intermediate-term trials may have several explanations. It is possible that the prevalence of these behaviors is indeed low (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2005</LINK>). Alternatively, the duration of treatment in these studies may have been too short to allow such behaviors to develop. Furthermore, although not mentioned specifically as an exclusion criterion in all studies, it is reasonable to assume that the recruitment of people with active or potential abuse disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar 1996</LINK>) into such studies would routinely be avoided. The need to further assess the risk of abuse and addiction continues to be important.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>The included articles studied participants with a wide range of neuropathies, but predominately postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and diabetic neuropathy. This reflects the distribution of neuropathic pain in the general population, with the exception that few studies included participants with back pain of neuropathic origin, which is thought to be the most common type of neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>). This may be due to the fact that it is often difficult to diagnose back pain as being purely neuropathic, with it frequently also having features of nociceptive pain. There were insufficient numbers of participants with individual neuropathies to perform a subanalysis of efficacy or safety. While our updated review added a substantial amount of data for each meta-analysis, the overall numbers are still low for most comparisons. In particular, the inconsistency of reporting of outcomes related to functioning precludes our making firm conclusions. Many of the studies reported outcomes only on those participants completing the trial; therefore efficacy may have been over-estimated. In those that performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) or modified ITT analysis, the most commonly used method of imputation was last observation carried forward (LOCF), which again may overestimate efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). None of the studies used baseline observation carried forward (BOCF). The short duration of many intermediate-term studies is also a potential source of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Several points deserve consideration in terms of applicability of the evidence.</P>
<P>First, the fact that short-term trials, in contrast to the intermediate-term trials, yielded inconsistent efficacy results suggests that short-term opioid administration is unlikely to serve as a useful predictive tool when initiating a trial of opioid therapy in people with neuropathic pain.</P>
<P>Second, the NNTB results further confirm that opioids reduce various forms of neuropathic pain and are relatively safe, and therefore indicate that opioids at low-to-moderate doses are suitable for use over periods of weeks to months in the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, despite the common use of NNTB values to compare relative efficacy of different treatments, especially when head-to-head comparative trials are relatively scarce, their validity has been questioned for reasons such as differences in trial designs, exclusion of non-placebo-controlled trials, dichotomization of data, and strict and not necessarily clinically relevant cut-off points (i.e. 50% pain relief) (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Third, the use of a single dimension for assessment of efficacy of analgesic treatments is problematic in any form of chronic pain, which is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. This becomes even more problematic in neuropathic pain, where even a single etiological syndrome (e.g. PHN) typically differs considerably from one patient to another in term of its clinical representation. For that reason the use of additional outcome measures rather than a single pain intensity or pain relief method have been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Wittink-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittink 2005</LINK>). Unfortunately, consistent improvement in specific features of neuropathic pain (e.g. evoked pain), in emotional or physical aspects of functioning, or in health-related quality of life could not be demonstrated in the present review.</P>
<P>Fourth, the debate regarding the differential efficacy of opioids for central versus peripheral neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Canavero-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavero 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dellemijn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellemijn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2004</LINK>) has not been resolved by our study. Results of the included studies varied considerably and the meta-analyses could not include all relevant studies. Despite limited data, the meta-analyses showed similar opioid responsiveness for pain of central and peripheral etiologies.</P>
<P>Fifth, although a dose-dependent analgesic effect was found in two studies, the dose ranges tested are still in the low-intermediate range and do not necessarily reflect clinical practice in some countries (e.g. the USA). This, along with increasing concerns about opioid toxicity, especially at higher dose ranges (greater than the daily equivalent of 200 mg of oral morphine), does not support the use of high doses of opioids for the relief of neuropathic pain.</P>
<P>Lastly, this review also included a quantitative analysis of common opioid-related adverse effects. Although the analysis is based on a relatively large number of participants with neuropathic pain, those enrolled in clinical trials may not be representative of the broader patient population seen in clinical practice. Enrolled participants have met inclusion criteria, and their willingness to enter a clinical trial suggests that they may have a higher adherence profile compared with those who are not enrolled.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-08-08 16:20:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence improved somewhat with those articles included in our updated search. Many more of the newer studies reported outcomes considered to be clinically relevant, such as numbers of participants with at least 50% pain relief, and in a format that allowed us to perform meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). Additionally, the risk of bias for each domain, while low overall, was generally lower in newer studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-08-09 11:53:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe the search methodology used here to be unbiased, and the selection criteria relevant to the nature of neuropathic pain. However, two aspects of our review methodology have the potential to introduce bias to our analyses. First, we included studies of less than 12 weeks duration. While we included 'short-term' studies purely for 'proof of concept', even amongst our 'intermediate-term' studies only one (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>) was conducted over 12 weeks. Studies of less than 12 weeks duration may overestimate treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>). Given the dearth of long-term studies, we adopted a 'best available evidence' approach, and anticipate that future studies will have longer durations, allowing us to better assess the efficacy and safety of opioids administered over clinically relevant time periods.</P>
<P>Second, we analyzed data from cross-over studies in the same manner as that from parallel studies. This approach may give rise to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). However, as discussed (<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>) we performed a sensitivity analysis where cross-over studies were removed from meta-analyses and found negligible differences in estimates of effect for either efficacy or safety.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-08-08 16:24:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most recent guidelines on the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain are in agreement with the results of the present review and recommend the use of opioids, typically as second- or third-line treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Attal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moulin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pergolizzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pergolizzi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of the evidence for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2010</LINK>) also found that opioids have a consistent efficacy in neuropathic pain. Notably, the NNTBs for achieving meaningful pain relief in several neuropathic pain conditions (i.e. painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury and mixed neuropathic pain) varied from 2.1 to 5.1 and were slightly lower than the NNTBs found in the present review. The differences in findings occurred for several reasons. First, we excluded studies with tramadol. Second, we had two additional studies in our NNTB analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Khoromi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khoromi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zin 2010</LINK>). Third, <LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2010</LINK> combined results for participants with at least 33% and at least 50% pain relief, whereas we analyzed these outcomes separately. Last, and perhaps most importantly, they performed meta-analysis separately for each neuropathic pain syndrome. We combined data as we considered numbers of participants for each syndrome to be insufficient for subanalysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-08 16:25:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Short-term studies provided only equivocal evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing the intensity of neuropathic pain. Intermediate-term studies demonstrated significant efficacy of opioids over placebo, but these results are likely to be subject to significant bias because of small size, short duration, and unclear, potentially inadequate methods for handling of dropouts. Analgesic efficacy of opioids in chronic neuropathic pain is subject to considerable uncertainty. The difference in outcomes between short-term and intermediate-term opioid studies does not support the use of short-term opioid administration as a predictive tool to decide whether to initiate a trial of opioid therapy. Although our review demonstrated clinically significant efficacy of opioids and an increase in the incidence of commonly-reported side effects in the intermediate term for neuropathic pain, the participants in the included studies may not reflect those commonly seen in practice. Therefore, issues such as rare but serious adverse events, abuse of medication, or conversely, non-compliance due to participants' unwillingness to tolerate side effects may not be accurately reflected in our results. Clinicians may be required to assess persons' suitability for a trial of opioid therapy and to monitor progress more rigorously than they would for other pharmacological treatments.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-26 16:32:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our updated and revised meta-analysis takes the necessary step of showing efficacy for spontaneous pain during opioid treatment for up to three months. A goal of future studies in this area should be to evaluate the true efficacy of opioids for neuropathic pain by means of trials with wider dose ranges rather than fixed-dose studies. In addition, further RCTs assessing longer-term efficacy, safety (including addiction potential), and improved quality of life should be undertaken before the value of opioids for management of neuropathic pain is finally established.</P>
