<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:57:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cocaine dependence is often associated with medical, psychological and social problems for individual and public health, generating problems for the community. Users play a role in the spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis, as well as in crime, violence and neonatal drug exposure. Use of drugs such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants and dopamine agonists to treat cocaine abuse or dependence is not supported by evidence from Cochrane reviews. The use of antipsychotic agents has also been considered, particularly because cocaine can induce hallucinations and paranoia that mimic psychosis.</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors identified 14 randomised controlled trials involving 719 adults. One study was conducted in Italy, and the rest in the USA. They involve both inpatient and outpatient settings and had a duration of 14 to 168 days (mean 80 days). Eleven trials randomised participants to receive an antipsychotic drug or placebo using the following antipsychotic medications: risperidone (three studies, 1 to 4 mg/day and one study with injections of long-acting risperidone at a dose of 25 mg/14 days); olanzapine (three studies, 2.5 to 20 mg/day); quetiapine (two studies, 400 and 800 mg/day); lamotrigine (one study, 400 mg/day); reserpine (one study, 50 mg/day). Three trials compared two drugs; olanzapine (10 mg/day) versus haloperidol (10 mg/day), olanzapine (20 mg/day) versus risperidone (9 mg/day) and aripiprazol (10 mg/day) versus ropirinol (4.5 mg/day).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The studies used different instruments or ways to assess the outcomes of interest, limiting the possibility for us to combine the data. When we grouped together all trial results comparing any antipsychotic drug to placebo, we found that antipsychotics slightly increase those who stayed in treatment but they were not effective in reducing cocaine use during treatment (two studies), in sustained abstinence (three studies), or in reducing the urge to consume cocaine (four studies). The single comparisons of each drug versus placebo or versus another drug were made in few trials with small sample sizes, limiting the reliability of the results. However, among these comparisons, only quetiapine seemed to perform better than placebo in reducing cocaine use and craving, but results came only from one study with 60 participants. Information was limited on the acceptability of treatment in terms of side effects, abstinence from cocaine use and withdrawal symptoms. Overall we found no evidence supporting the clinical use of antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cocaine dependence.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The major limitations of the studies were the high number of people who withdrew from them and the lack of clear reporting of the methods used to conduct the studies. Moreover, the number of participants was small, and different ways of measuring and reporting results were used, limiting the possibility for us to combine the data. Overall we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for dropouts and low for all the other outcomes considered. The evidence is current up to 15 of July 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Funding and conflict of interest reported by the studies</B>
</P>
<P>The majority of trials included in this review had funding from industrial sources or declared conflict of interests for some of the researchers due to different contractual collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry. Only five of the 14 included trials reported being funded exclusively by non-industry sources, and of these just one (Grabowski 2004) disclosed no conflict of interest for the authors. Another study (Brown 2012) reported conflicts of interest for several authors and three studies (Levin 1999, Reid 2005 and Winhusen 2007) did not disclose conflict of interest of the authors. One included trial (Meini 2010) did not report information about funding sources, but disclosed no conflict of interest for the authors. The other eight studies included in this review were either funded by industry (Brown 2010; Hamilton 2009; Kampman 2003), or by a combination of industry and non-industry grants (Akerele 2007; Loebl 2008; Smelson 2004; Smelson 2006; Tapp 2015), with three (Brown 2010; Hamilton 2009; Kampman 2003) disclosing conflicts of interests for the authors, and the rest without declaration on this issue.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-16 23:15:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 14 studies (719 participants). The antipsychotic drugs studied were risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, lamotrigine, aripiprazol, haloperidol and reserpine. Comparing any antipsychotic drugs versus placebo, we found that antipsychotics reduced dropout: eight studies, 397 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97), moderate quality of evidence. We found no significant differences for any of the other primary outcomes considered: number of participants using cocaine during the treatment, two studies, 91 participants: RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.62); continuous abstinence, three studies, 139 participants: RR 1.30 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.32); side effects, six studies, 291 participants: RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.10); and craving, four studies, 240 participants: RR 0.13 (-1.08 to 1.35). For all of these comparisons we rated the quality of evidence as low.</P>
<P>Comparisons of single drug versus placebo or versus another drug are conducted in few trials with small sample sizes, limiting the reliability of the results. Among these comparisons, only quetiapine seemed to outperform placebo in reducing cocaine use, measured by grams per week: mean difference (MD) -0.54 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.16), by US dollars spent per week: MD -53.80 (95% CI -97.85 to -9.75), and by craving: MD -1.23 (95% CI -2.19 to -0.27), but results came from one study with 60 participants.</P>
<P>The major limitations of the studies were the high risk of attrition bias (40% of the included studies) and low quality of reporting, mainly for the risk of selection bias, performance and detection bias, that we rated as being at unclear risk for 75% to 80% of the studies. Furthermore, most of the included studies did not report results on important outcomes such as side effects, or use of cocaine during treatment and craving, which prevented the possibility of including them in statistical synthesis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:56:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the coca leaf, being commonly used as powder, for intranasal or intravenous use, or as crack, a free-base form which is normally smoked. Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem, characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a wide and well-documented range of consequences associated with acute and chronic use of this drug, such as medical, psychological and social problems, including the spread of infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis), criminal behaviour, violence and neonatal drug exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 1994</LINK>). Both injection and non-injection cocaine use are thought to increase the risk of HIV infection through high-risk injecting and sexual behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The illicit use of cocaine has become a persistent health problem worldwide. According to the estimates of the World Drug Report 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-UNDOC-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNDOC 2015</LINK>) about 0.4 % of the global population uses cocaine, and in recent European national population surveys between 0.3% and 9% of the adult population report having tried cocaine at least once (i.e. lifetime prevalence), with Ireland (6.8%), Spain (8.8%) and the United Kingdom (9%) being at the upper end of this range. Recent cocaine use (last 12 months) is, in general, reported by less than 1% of adults; in most countries, the range is between 0.1% and 1%. After a peak in 2008, a decline in cocaine use has been observed in almost all countries, including those reporting high prevalence rates. In Spain and the United Kingdom recent prevalence rates are still around 2%. Although cocaine prevalence figures are much lower than comparable figures for cannabis, levels of use among younger adults can be higher than the population average. Lifetime experience among 15- to 34-year-olds ranges from 0.7% to 11.9%, with the highest levels again being found in Spain (11.1%) and the United Kingdom (11.9%). Recent use ranges from 0.2% to 3.6%, with Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands all having rates of about 2%; Spain and the United Kingdom over 3% and 3.6% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014b</LINK>). In the USA in 2013, an estimated 1.5 million people (0.6%) were current cocaine users (<LINK REF="REF-NSDUH-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSDUH 2014</LINK>).The number of people entering treatment for the first time in their life for primary cocaine use has been decreasing in recent years in countries with traditionally high prevalence, from a peak of 38,000 in 2008 to 24,000 in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2015</LINK>). Differences exist between countries, with more than 70% of all cocaine users being reported by only three European countries: Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although effective pharmacotherapy is available for alcohol and heroin dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brian 2001</LINK>), none exists currently for cocaine dependence despite more than two decades of clinical trials primarily involving antidepressant, anticonvulsant and dopaminergic medications. </P>
<P>Cocaine effect seems to rely on its ability to increase the availability of monoamines (dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline) in the brain. The dopamine increase in specific areas of the mesolimbic system, which is shared by cocaine with other drugs like heroin, alcohol, cannabis and nicotine, has been involved in rewarding effect of drugs and self-administration behaviour in animals and humans (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Chiara-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Chiara 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drevets-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drevets 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drevets-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drevets 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volkow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volkow 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been extensive research of optimal pharmacological approaches to the treatment of cocaine dependence, with consideration of both dopamine antagonists and agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Grabowski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabowski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosten-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosten 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Cocaine dependence remains a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists, although considerable advances in the neurobiology of this addiction could guide future medication development.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antipsychotics have been candidates for the treatment of addiction for their ability to block dopamine receptors and counterbalance the increase in dopaminergic activity related to drugs' effects. However, while the short-term effect of cocaine is associated with dopamine increase in definite brain areas, acute and protracted withdrawal from this drug is associated with diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission. This reduced dopaminergic tone may underlie impaired hedonic function and increased craving, so maintaining the addictive behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Dackis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dackis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuhar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhar 1996</LINK>). On this basis, the supposed efficacy of dopamine antagonists in cocaine addiction could be questionable, since their use could even further reduce dopamine tone.<BR/>While these observations apply well to classical neuroleptics, which exert their action essentially through the dopaminergic system, the so-called 'atypical' ones, like risperidone and olanzapine, extend their action to other brain systems which have been involved in drug addiction. Particularly, their action on the serotoninergic system has been regarded with interest, given the involvement of serotonin neurotransmission in addictive behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Filip-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filip 2005</LINK>). The use of atypical neuroleptics in cocaine addiction has also been criticised due to their antagonist effect on dopamine receptors. However, their interference with the serotoninergic system and a less severe side-effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Berk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 1999</LINK>) could improve the compliance of patients and promote their retention in treatment. These assumptions would support the use of atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine and aripripazol in the treatment of cocaine addiction.</P>
<P>Furthermore, cocaine use can lead to symptoms mimicking psychosis, such as hallucinations and paranoia, and the use of antipsychotics may relieve these symptoms. Some of the antipsychotics more commonly studied for this purpose are, for example, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone and lamotrigine.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-16 23:50:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (BII, SM) independently assessed risk of bias of the included studies.</P>
<P>We conducted the 'Risk of bias' assessment using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews is a two-part tool, addressing specific domains, namely sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement related to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgements we used the criteria indicated by the Handbook, adapted to the addiction field. See <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>We addressed the domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>We considered blinding of participants and of outcome assessors (avoidance of detection bias) separately for objective outcomes (e.g. dropouts, abstinence measured by urinanalysis, participants relapsed at the end of follow-up) and for subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, craving, participant self-reported use of substances, side effects, psychiatric symptoms, clinical global evaluation).</P>
<P>We assessed incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) for all outcomes except for the dropout rates from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for a detailed description of how we assessed the risks of bias in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Grading of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome using the GRADE system. The GRADE Working Group developed a system for grading the quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2006</LINK>) which takes into account issues not only related to internal validity but also to external validity, such as directness of results. The 'Summary of findings' tables present the main findings of a review in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, they provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes.</P>
<P>The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grades of evidence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Grading is decreased for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality.</LI>
<LI>Important inconsistency (-1).</LI>
<LI>Some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness.</LI>
<LI>Imprecise or sparse data (-1).</LI>
<LI>High probability of reporting bias (-1).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Grading is increased for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Strong evidence of association - significant relative risk of &gt; 2 (&lt; 0.5) based on consistent evidence from two or more observational studies, with no plausible confounders (+1).</LI>
<LI>Very strong evidence of association - significant relative risk of &gt; 5 (&lt; 0.2) based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity (+2).</LI>
<LI>Evidence of a dose-response gradient (+1).</LI>
<LI>All plausible confounders would have reduced the effect (+1).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed dichotomous outcomes by calculating the risk ratio (RR) for each trial with uncertainty in each result expressed by 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous outcomes by calculating the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI when studies used the same instrument to assess the outcome. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) when studies used different instruments. For craving score, severity of dependence (Drug ASI, CGI-O, depression (HAM-D) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)), we compared the postintervention mean scores of the experimental and control groups. Meta-analysis of continuous outcomes of the old studies of ASI, CGI-O, HAM-D and HAM-A had to be redone for postintervention outcomes, because the previous type of analysis comparing before-and-after changes was incorrect.</P>

We now excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Grabowski-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grabowski 2006</LINK>), included in the previous version as an ongoing trial which met the inclusion criteria, due to a modification in the study protocol in 2007. The pharmacological intervention had been modified, substituting an antipsychotic drug (aripiprazol) with an antidepressant (citalopram), thus rendering it ineligible for this update. Another study included in the previous version (<LINK REF="STD-Berger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berger 1996</LINK>) was excluded from the update because the outcome did not comply with our inclusion criteria.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:14:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We include 14 trials. They tested risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, lamotrigine, reserpine, haloperidol and aripiprazol as antipsychotic agents for the treatment of cocaine dependence, comparing them with placebo and in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smelson 2006</LINK>) comparing two drugs.</P>
<P>Comparing any antipsychotic drugs versus placebo, we found moderate-quality evidence that antipsychotics reduced dropouts; these findings came from eight studies with 397 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grabowski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grabowski 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kampman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kampman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loebl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loebl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smelson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smelson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tapp 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winhusen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Winhusen 2007</LINK>). There were no significant differences for any of the other primary outcomes: number of participants using cocaine during the treatment (as days/week by urine tests or self report): continuous abstinence (number of participants who maintained negative drug screens for two to three weeks), and side effects (number of participants with at least one side effect), but the evidence was low and came from only two, three and four studies respectively. We also found low-quality evidence showing no difference in craving as assessed by the BSCS, but these results are based on only four studies with 240 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kampman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kampman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tapp 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winhusen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Winhusen 2007</LINK>). The single comparisons of each drug versus placebo or versus another drug included few trials with small sample sizes, so limiting the reliability of the results. Among these comparisons, only quetiapine seemed to perform better than placebo in reducing cocaine use as measured by grams per week or US dollars spent per week, and in levels of craving assessed by the BSCS. These results came only from two studies, one with 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tapp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tapp 2015</LINK>) and another with 20 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:14:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirteen of the 14 included studies were conducted in the USA; this limits the generalisability of the results, because health effects of various substances of abuse seem to be strongly dependent on social context, and the location of the conduct of the studies could act as an effect modifier in the estimation of the efficacy of treatment.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies did not report useful results on important outcomes such as side effects, use of cocaine during the treatment and craving. In those studies which did report them, it was not possible to undertake a cumulative analysis because of the great heterogeneity of the scales used in the primary studies and in the way in which results are reported.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:14:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The major limitations of the studies were the high risk of attrition bias (40% of the included studies) and the low quality of reporting, mainly affecting the risk of selection bias, and performance and detection bias, which we rated as being at unclear risk for 75% to 80% of the studies. Overall we rated study quality as moderate for dropouts, and low for the other outcomes</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-03-17 00:20:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of publication bias by Funnel plot could not be assessed because less than ten trials were included in the analysis. We performed a very comprehensive search and contacted investigators to request information about unpublished or incomplete trials. However, publication bias could not be excluded because only small studies have been included in the analyses.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 14:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The argument in favour of antipsychotics for treating cocaine use disorders is based largely on their use in treating psychiatric complications, which is not the same as treating the use disorder itself. Antipsychotics are not risk-free medications; their side effects are not trivial and may be long-lasting. We have not found positive effects on reduction in cocaine use. At present, there is no evidence supporting the clinical use of antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cocaine dependence, although results come from only 14 trials, with small sample sizes and moderate-to-low quality of evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-25 14:07:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the included studies did not report useful results on important outcomes such as side effects, use of cocaine during the treatment, and craving. When studies did report them, no cumulative analysis was possible due to great heterogeneity among the scales used by the primary studies and in the way results were reported. This major problem needs to be addressed in future research through the use of instruments that allow for improved comparability of results and by following best-practice recommendations for the reporting of results (i.e. GRADE).</P>
<P>Given the absence of promising results for reduction of drug use and the relevance of side effects, no further research seems to be justified to explore the effectiveness of this class of drug in people without psychiatric comorbidities or complications.</P>

<P>We now excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Grabowski-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grabowski 2006</LINK>), included in the previous version as an ongoing trial which met the inclusion criteria, due to a modification in the study protocol in 2007. The pharmacological intervention had been modified, substituting an antipsychotic drug (aripiprazol) with an antidepressant (citalopram), thus rendering it ineligible for this update. Another study included in the previous version (<LINK REF="STD-Berger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berger 1996</LINK>) was excluded from the update because the outcome did not comply with our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of continuous outcomes of the old studies of ASI, CGI-O, HAM-D and HAM-A had to be redone for postintervention outcomes, because the previous type of analysis comparing before-and-after changes was incorrect.</P>
