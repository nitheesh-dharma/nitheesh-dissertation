<P>Intravenous lidocaine and oral derivatives relieve pain from damage to the nervous system (neuropathic pain). In early reports, intravenous lidocaine and its oral analogs mexiletine and tocainide relieved neuropathic pain, a type of pain caused by disease in the nervous system. However, the evidence was conflicting. The authors reviewed all randomized studies comparing these drugs with placebo or with other analgesics and found that: local anesthetics were superior to placebo in decreasing intensity of neuropathic pain; limited data showed no difference in efficacy or adverse effects between local anesthetics and carbamazepine, amantadine, gabapentin or morphine; local anesthetics had more adverse effects than placebo; and local anesthetics were safe.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lidocaine, mexiletine, tocainide, and flecainide are local anesthetics which give an analgesic effect when administered orally or parenterally. Early reports described the use of intravenous lidocaine or procaine to relieve cancer and postoperative pain. Interest reappeared decades later when patient series and clinical trials reported that parenteral lidocaine and its oral analogs tocainide, mexiletine, and flecainide relieved neuropathic pain in some patients. With the recent publication of clinical trials with high quality standards, we have reviewed the use of systemic lidocaine and its oral analogs in neuropathic pain to update our knowledge, to measure their benefit and harm, and to better define their role in therapy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate pain relief and adverse effect rates between systemic local anesthetic-type drugs and other control interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 through 15 May 2004), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2002), Cancer Lit (through 15 December 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd Quarter, 2004), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), and LILACS, from January 1966 through March 2001. We also hand searched conference proceedings, textbooks, original articles and reviews. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included trials with random allocation, that were double blinded, with a parallel or crossover design. The control intervention was a placebo or an analgesic drug for neuropathic pain from any cause. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We collected efficacy and safety data from all published and unpublished trials. We calculated combined effect sizes using continuous and binary data for pain relief and adverse effects as primary and secondary outcome measurements, respectively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 14:48:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Thirty-two controlled clinical trials met the selection criteria; two were duplicate articles. The treatment drugs were intravenous lidocaine (16 trials), mexiletine (12 trials), lidocaine plus mexiletine sequentially (one trial), and tocainide (one trial). Twenty-one trials were crossover studies, and nine were parallel. Lidocaine and mexiletine were superior to placebo [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -11; 95% CI: -15 to -7; P &lt; 0.00001], and limited data showed no difference in efficacy (WMD = -0.6; 95% CI: -7 to 6), or adverse effects versus carbamazepine, amantadine, gabapentin or morphine. In these trials, systemic local anesthetics were safe, with no deaths or life-threatening toxicities. Sensitivity analysis identified data distribution in three trials as a probable source of heterogeneity. There was no publication bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Lidocaine and oral analogs were safe drugs in controlled clinical trials for neuropathic pain, were better than placebo, and were as effective as other analgesics. Future trials should enroll specific diseases and test novel lidocaine analogs with better toxicity profiles. More emphasis is necessary on outcomes measuring patient satisfaction to assess if statistically significant pain relief is clinically meaningful. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Lidocaine (lignocaine) is a local anesthetic used intravenously as an antiarrhythmic drug. Early reports described the use of intravenous lidocaine or procaine to relieve cancer and postoperative pain (<LINK REF="STD-Keats-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Keats 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Clive_x002d_Lowe-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Clive-Lowe 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1961</LINK>). Interest reappeared decades later when patient series and clinical trials reported that parenteral lidocaine and its oral analogs tocainide, mexiletine, and flecainide relieved neuropathic pain in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Boas-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindblom-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindblom 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bach-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bach 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Awerbuch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awerbuch 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>The International Association for the Study of Pain defined neuropathic pain as pain resulting from damage to the peripheral or central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Merskey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merskey 1994</LINK>). There is no uniform classification for neuropathic pain, but a convenient and simple anatomical classification divided neuropathic pain as peripheral or central, depending on the location of the primary lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Bowsher-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowsher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2003</LINK>). This classification attempted to give uniformity to a symptom that represented the common expression of many different disorders. There is experimental evidence that systemic lidocaine lessened pain by blockade of peripheral and central sodium ion gate channels (<LINK REF="REF-Woolf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 1985</LINK>), although the analgesic action of lidocaine may be more complex, and the inhibition of neuronal ectopic discharges is one of several mechanisms involved (<LINK REF="REF-Nagy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagy 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is unclear why some patients with neuropathic pain responded better to lidocaine than others (<LINK REF="REF-Mao-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mao 2000</LINK>). In animal models, lidocaine modified or relieved some components of neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Abdi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdi 1998</LINK>), an observation reproduced in clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Galer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Attal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Attal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2004</LINK>). Lidocaine was not suitable for long term use, so pain clinicians and researchers used its oral analogs, mostly mexiletine. However, the evidence for mexiletine as an effective drug in neuropathic pain was weak; the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) diabetic polyneuropathy or central pain with mexiletine ranged between 10 and 38, placing this drug below other agents for neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 2000</LINK>). This estimate was based on a few trials providing response rates, when most trials measured pain relief as continuous data. A systematic review of local anesthetic drugs for chronic (including neuropathic and nociceptive) pain concluded that lidocaine and oral analogs "are effective in pain due to nerve damage, but there is little or no evidence to support their use in cancer-related pain" (<LINK REF="REF-Kalso-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kalso-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 1998</LINK> included in his review other types of pain, and did not measure the therapeutic benefit of lidocaine and its oral analogs. With the recent publication of clinical trials with high quality standards, we have reviewed the use of systemic lidocaine and its oral analogs in neuropathic pain to update our knowledge, to measure their benefit and harm, and to better define their role in therapy.</P>

<P>We used a search strategy based on guidelines published elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2001</LINK>). We combined a series of search terms relevant to randomized double blind, placebo-controlled trials with pain-specific terms and with the subject headings related to forms of local anesthetic agents or to local anesthetics as a class of drugs. The search strategy was adapted to each of the following databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1st Quarter 2004); EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2004); CancerLit (1963 to December 2002); LILACS; and the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE). We searched in CancerLit and SIGLE for conference proceedings. We contacted investigators to learn about unpublished trials, or to request additional information on published trials. There was not any language restriction. We adapted the list of terms found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> to each of the electronic databases.</P>

<P>Three of us independently screened all titles and abstracts identified in the literature search. We resolved any disagreement by discussion to find a consensus, and were not blinded to the author names, affiliated institutions, journal of publication, or study results. We examined the internal validity of each trial using the Oxford Quality Score criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis </HEADING>
<P>We extracted data on participants, methods, interventions, outcome measurements, and adverse effects from the original articles. The outcomes and the instruments to measure them varied across studies. The outcome measurements were published as binary (dichotomous) or continuous data. The continuous data included medians, means with standard deviations or standard errors. In the articles that did not publish standard deviations, we could still derive the standard deviation if the article included the number of participants and the standard error. We dichotomized ordinal scales to pain relief (proportion of patients with significant and total pain relief) or no pain relief (moderate, mild, or no pain relief) to estimate response rates. We extracted data on adverse effects as listed and defined by the authors. We did not make judgments on drug causation. We combined the data on pain relief and adverse effects to obtain a pooled effect size for each outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Synthesis and presentation of data</HEADING>
<P>Data analysis was done with RevMan Analyses for Windows version 1.0.2, the analysis module for RevMan 4.2.2. We estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between placebo control or active control and the treatment intervention using visual analog scores (VAS). We studied statistical heterogeneity using the Cochrane Q test (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic is a reliable and robust test to quantify heterogeneity, since it does not depend on the number of trials or on the between-study variance. I<SUP>2</SUP> measures the extent of inconsistency among the studies' results, and we can interpret this statistic as the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. Other sensitivity tests to investigate heterogeneity and publication bias were the comparison between model effects (fixed and random), and subgroup analyses by number of participants, etiology, drug type, trial quality, trial design, and time of outcome measurement. We used funnel plots to investigate publication bias and heterogeneity.<BR/>For the analysis of response rates and for adverse effects we used binary data to estimate odds ratios (OR) in a random effects model. We included pooled response rates as defined by the different investigators, because such outcomes may have more clinical meaning to patients and clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>).</P>

For trials measuring pain at different times we chose the last measurement time, except one study in which we pooled the data from all time points (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1992</LINK>). However, the negative results of this study were not affected by data from any single time point. We pooled daytime and nocturnal pain scores for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oskarsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oskarsson 1997</LINK>), and for a trial on post-amputation pain evaluating stump and phantom pain, we chose stump pain (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>).<BR/>Pretreatment and posttreatment mean pain scores were available from 11 lidocaine and nine mexiletine trials (n = 750), for a total of 371 patients allocated to the treatment drug and 379 patients allocated to the placebo intervention. The summary effect size favors both lidocaine and mexiletine over placebo to decrease chronic neuropathic pain in the random and fixed effects models (WMD = -11 mm; 95% CI: -15 to -7 mm; P &lt;0.00001, random effects model). We found a slightly asymmetric funnel plot due to three studies on or out of the 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baranowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baranowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fassoulaki-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fassoulaki 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the mexiletine clinical trials included for meta-analysis, 184 patients received mexiletine and 193 received placebo. The heterogeneity was greater than in the lidocaine trials because two trials had a wide dispersion of data around the mean (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fassoulaki-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fassoulaki 2002</LINK>).

<P>We could extract response rates from 14 trials (lidocaine, n = 9; mexiletine, n = 5). Each article included presented a proportion of responders, most defining response as a 30% or greater decrease in pain. The total number of participants was 589, 321 patients treated with local anesthetics and 268 patients who received placebo. Forty-seven percent (151/321) allocated to local anesthetics had significant pain relief compared with 22% (59/268) of those receiving placebo (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.1 to 5.6). Mexiletine was as effective as lidocaine for patients with significant pain relief, and the studies with mexiletine yielded more precise estimates of effect mainly because of the number of participants. There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity.</P>

<P>We divided trials in two subgroups: fewer than 25 participants (n = 17, six mexiletine trials and 11 lidocaine trials), and more than 25 participants (n = 3, two mexiletine trials and one lidocaine trial). The subgroup of trials with fewer than 25 patients was not statistically heterogeneous, despite mixing lidocaine and mexiletine trials and that 50% of these studies were negative. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the subgroup with more than 25 patients due to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>). These results suggest that heterogeneity was not due to the intervention or to the number of participants, and that there was no publication bias because half of the small trials were negative studies.</P>

<P>Although there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity in the subgroup with outcome measurements within 24 hours (n = 10, all lidocaine trials), the second subgroup (outcome measurements recorded for more than 24 hours, n = 10) was heterogeneous. If we excluded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>, outcome 03), heterogeneity virtually disappeared (P = 0.41, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.8%). In another sensitivity analysis, we excluded the three trials with widely spread data (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baranowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baranowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fassoulaki-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fassoulaki 2002</LINK>, outcome 04); the effect sizes for both subgroups separately or combined showed no evidence of statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial design (Comparison 02, outcome 5)</HEADING>
<P>The classification by trial design was straightforward: trials had a crossover or a parallel treatment sequence.

<P>We divided trials in three subgroups: studies with a score between two and three points (low and fair quality), four points (good quality), and studies with five points (very good quality). The subgroup with the best methodological quality was homogeneous despite one trial with widely spread data, suggesting that high methodological quality reduced heterogeneity. The heterogeneity present in the other two subgroups decreased sensibly after removing two trials with widely dispersed data. Such findings suggest that heterogeneity is less if trials have very high quality standards.</P>

<LI>Peripheral, infectious cause: Three trials including HIV-1-related polyneuropathy treated with mexiletine (n = 1), and postherpetic neuralgia treated with lidocaine (n = 2).</LI>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The main and most solid conclusion of this review is that intravenous lidocaine and its oral analog mexiletine were more effective than placebo in decreasing neuropathic pain. The treatment effect was similar and consistent for both drugs despite clinical variability between trials. These results are more precise than previous estimates of effect published for mexiletine (<LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 2000</LINK>). The role of systemic local anesthetics to treat neuropathic pain was controversial, and difficult to define objectively even in comparison with placebo interventions. The complex nature of neuropathic pain, and the methodological flaws of some clinical trials underlie this fragmentary evidence and lack of definition; more than half of the 29 trials were of low or fair methodological quality, one third did not adequately describe the method for random allocation, and 80% did not estimate the number of participants to have enough statistical power. However, these deficiencies could be due to incomplete reporting of a clinical trial at publication and not to poor methodology, as an observational study showed with randomized controlled trials conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A previous systematic review of local anesthetics on chronic pain found evidence to support these drugs, yet the evidence was qualitative (<LINK REF="REF-Kalso-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 1998</LINK>). Other reviews were narrative (<LINK REF="REF-Mao-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mao 2000</LINK>), limited by their own nature and prone to author bias. We approached the problem of fragmented evidence by synthesizing all the quantitative data published so far, and by examining variables that may limit and confuse the interpretation of results. We investigated, identified, and explained sources of heterogeneity in this review. By using subgroup analysis we found that statistical heterogeneity was confined to two or three clinical trials, and that their exclusion did lessen heterogeneity but did not affect the overall treatment effect. Therefore, the final results were robust against statistical heterogeneity or clinical variability. </P>
<P>We observed in the subgroup analysis that lidocaine and mexiletine were more effective for pain from diabetes, trauma, and cerebrovascular disease than for other causes. However, such finding comes from an arbitrary, retrospective classification to assess heterogeneity, and we cannot make firm conclusions based on such results. We also investigated publication bias, a frequent problem limiting the validity of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We did not find evidence of such bias because positive and negative studies were evenly split in trials with fewer than 25 participants, and the effect sizes between small and large studies were roughly similar. </P>
<P>A more difficult question to answer is whether a mean difference of 11 mm on a 0-100 VAS (or 1.1 on a 0-10 NRS) represents a true clinical difference for patients. For neuropathic pain, we believe that this effect size is clinically relevant. First, most study participants had chronic pain, had been previously treated with other analgesics, and had failed such treatments; hence, this is a group very difficult to treat, and small quantitative differences in these patients are valuable. Second, the response to placebo may render new treatments ineffective if such response is large enough to lessen any statistical difference. Third, the analysis of continuous data from pain scales using means or medians is a mathematical attempt to make a multidimensional, subjective variable like pain more objective. A limitation of the use of mean pain scores is that individual responses may not follow a normal probability distribution but rather a bimodal pattern, in which a mean difference of 11 mm can be a clinical difference for some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>). Even in the absence of a bimodal distribution, individual patients may experience a larger response. </P>
<P>One solution to this problem in clinical pain research is the use of binary data, expressing results as response rates. The definition of the smallest decline in pain intensity considered successful or clinically significant by the patient has been explored (<LINK REF="REF-Sriwatanakul-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sriwatanakul 1982</LINK>). Recent research analyzing data from large randomized clinical trials showed that a clinically meaningful difference begins around a 30% reduction in pain intensity, or a 2-point reduction in absolute pain intensity (0-10 scale) (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2003</LINK>). Two of these studies deserve more comment. The first study analyzed pain response data from 130 patients with cancer-related breakthrough pain treated with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in a randomized controlled trial. Two of the scales were absolute pain intensity difference, and the percentage pain intensity difference. Patients defined pain relief as clinically important when they did not have to use another opioid as rescue of the painful episode. The best cut-off points defining clinically important pain relief were a change in the percent pain intensity difference of 33% or greater, and a change in absolute pain intensity difference of 2 points or greater on an 11-point numerical scale (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>). A similar analysis of 2724 patients participating in clinical trials with pregabalin yielded identical results. These patients had diabetic neuropathy, osteoarthritis, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic low back pain, and fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>). We collected and analyzed the responder rates published in 14 of the mexiletine and lidocaine trials. We found that both drugs were better than placebo. This result is in agreement with the WMD between oral anesthetics and placebo, suggesting that such a difference is clinically important (comparison 01, outcome 02). This result is valid for our systematic review, and could be cautiously extrapolated to future trials using local anesthetics, but may not be applicable to studies of neuropathic pain using other experimental interventions. </P>
<P>In this review, a limited number of trials did not show a difference in efficacy between lidocaine and its oral analogs and other analgesics for treating neuropathic pain, for example the single study that compared tocainide with carbamazepine did not show a difference between the two drugs. This finding implies that lidocaine and mexiletine may be as good as other analgesics. However, even though it is permissible to use different control interventions in a meta-analysis, each control intervention had few patients, and we cannot generalize these results with enough confidence. This area of research needs development, and we need more controlled clinical trials comparing local anesthetic-type drugs against other analgesics.</P>
<P>We showed in this review that lidocaine and other oral analogs of lidocaine caused more adverse effects than placebo. However, the use of such drugs was safe, as we did not find reports of severe toxicity or life-threatening events, and very few withdrawals. We did not find any difference in the frequency of adverse effects between lidocaine or mexiletine compared with morphine, gabapentin, amantadine, amitriptyline, ketamine, or carbamazepine. The use of other analgesics makes unblinding more difficult, as all participants are exposed to drugs with the potential to cause side effects. Adverse effects from lidocaine or mexiletine may be more frequent in debilitated patients with poor functional status, for example in participants with advanced cancer or HIV infection, creating the impression of easy toxicity that will bias the study results against the experimental intervention. To avoid such bias, researchers should consider stratification by performance status. </P>
<P>In trials controlled with placebo, a narrow margin between benefit and adverse effects can be a problem to keep participants and researchers blinded to the interventions, because it may unmask the treatment intervention to participants and investigators. Very few trials with lidocaine or its oral analogs used strategies to reduce this unmasking effect, such as using active placebos (<LINK REF="STD-Wallace-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>), including a checklist of unrelated symptoms to confound participants (<LINK REF="STD-Backonja-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Backonja 2000</LINK>), or asking the participants whether they knew what treatment they received at the end of each intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Attal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Attal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Attal 2004</LINK>). This is not surprising because only 2% of 191 randomized clinical trials published in top medical and psychiatry journals assessed blinding in participants and investigators, indicating that lack of blinding assessment is widespread (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>As intravenous lidocaine has a very limited role to manage pain in the outpatient population, it is important to plan controlled clinical trials with subcutaneous lidocaine given by pumps with preset dose infusions, or to use mexiletine and newer analogs to treat pain in diseases for which there is little or no evidence, such as trigeminal neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, poststroke central pain, post-amputation pain, or the complex regional pain syndrome types I and II. <BR/>Considerable debate surrounds the field of systematic reviews. Some have recommended caution on the potential mis-application of such methods (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1997</LINK>). Others have shown how meta-analyses of low quality trials may produce unreliable estimates of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hedges-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 2001</LINK>). We believe to have kept these risks to a minimum, by taking special care to investigate bias, methodological quality, and by acknowledging the limits of some results in this review. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The role of lidocaine and its oral analogs to control neuropathic pain was unclear until recently. This lack of definition was due to the multifaceted nature of neuropathic pain, the statistical and clinical heterogeneity of many of the trials, and few study participants. These drugs can relieve pain in selected patients with neuropathic pain, compared with placebo. We found evidence suggesting that this analgesic effect is also clinically important.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There should be greater emphasis on accruing patients with neuropathic pain caused by one disease, with well-structured, consistent trials with active placebos or active drug controls to evaluate the efficacy of local anesthetic-type drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain from specific etiologies. Future trials should also explore subcutaneous infusions with lidocaine, and move to newer oral analogs with more specificity to sodium channel receptor subtypes and fewer adverse effects. In addition, we recommend that future trials include quality of life or global satisfaction endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Compared with placebo, lidocaine significantly reduced evoked pain at the end of treatment (P&lt;0.05, Median difference = - 30, 95% CI: -50 to 0). Lidocaine did not significantly improve spontaneous pain over placebo (Median difference = - 16.5, 95% CI: -38 to 5). Significant analgesia on spontaneous pain for the first 45 min post-injection. During 3 weeks follow-up, no difference in pain between lidocaine and placebo. No statistically significant difference between placebo and lidocaine in mechanothermal detection and pain thresholds. Global assessment of pain: 11/32 patients reported moderate-complete pain relief vs 6/32 with placebo.</P>
