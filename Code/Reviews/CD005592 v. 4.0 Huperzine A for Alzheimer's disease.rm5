<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is currently insufficient evidence of the effects of Huperzine A for Alzheimer's disease (AD).</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Huperzine A is derived from Chinese club moss Huperzia serrata, and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial for AD. This review looked for randomized trials comparing Huperzine A with control in patients with AD. Six trials were identified but most trials were of low methodological quality. Although Huperzine A seemed to have some beneficial effects on improvement of general cognitive function, global clinical status, behavioral disturbance and functional performance for patients with AD, the small trials with limited numbers of patients and the low methodological quality resulted in cautious assessment of the results. More large, high-quality randomized trials are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major public health problem around the world due to its increasing prevalence, long duration, caregiver burden, and high financial cost of care. The degeneration of acetylcholine-containing neurons in the basal forebrain has been implicated in the symptoms of AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors may block the degradation of acetylcholine, thus increasing the efficacy of the remaining cholinergic neurons. Huperzine A is a linearly competitive, reversible inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase that is said to have both central and peripheral activity with the ability to protect cells against hydrogen peroxide, beta-amyloid protein (or peptide), glutamate, ischemia and staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These properties might qualify Huperzine A as a promising agent for treating dementia (including AD).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of Huperzine A for the treatment of patients with AD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group was searched on 1 February 2006 using the search term: huperzin*. The CDCIG Specialized register contains records from all major health care databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SIGLE, ISTP, INSIDE, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. In addition, the CBM and AMED databases and relevant websites were searched and some journals were hand-searched. Specialists in the field were approached for unpublished material and any publications found were searched for additional references.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P> All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of Huperzine A for AD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a self-developed data extraction form and entered into RevMan 4.2.10 software. Meta-analyses were performed when more than one trial provided data on a comparable outcome on sufficiently similar patients. Random effects analyses were performed whenever heterogeneity between results appeared to be present. Standardized differences in mean outcome measures were used due to the use of different scales and periods of treatment.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials including a total of 454 patients met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of most included trials was not high. It was shown that compared to placebo, Huperzine A had beneficial effects on the improvement of general cognitive function measured by MMSE (WMD 2.81; 95% CI 1.87 to 3.76; P &lt; 0.00001) and ADAS-Cog at six weeks (WMD 1.91; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.55) and at 12 weeks (WMD 2.51; 95% CI 1.74 to 3.28), global clinical assessment measured by CDR (WMD -0.80; 95% CI -0.95 to -0.65) and CIBIC-plus (OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.37 to 7.90), behavioral disturbance measured by ADAS-non-Cog at six weeks (WMD -1.33, 95%CI -2.12 to -0.54) and at 12 weeks (WMD -1.52, 95% CI-2.39 to -0.65), and functional performance measured by ADL (WMD = -7.17; 95% CI -9.13 to -5.22; P &lt; 0.00001). However, Huperzine A was not superior to placebo in the improvement of general cognitive function measured by Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS) (WMD: 2.78; 95% CI -0.17 to 5.73, P = 0.06) and specific cognitive function measured by Weshler Memory Scale (WMS) (WMD = 6.64; 95% CI -3.22 to 16.50; P = 0.19). No data were available on quality of life and caregiver burden. The adverse events of Huperzine A were mild and there were no significant differences of adverse events between Huperzine A groups and control groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>From the available evidence, Huperzine A seems to have some beneficial effects on improvement of general cognitive function, global clinical status, behavioral disturbance and functional performance, with no obvious serious adverse events for patients with AD. However, only one study was of adequate quality and size. There is therefore inadequate evidence to make any recommendation about its use. Rigorous design, randomized, multi-centre, large-sample trials of Huperzine A for AD are needed to further assess the effects.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting older people. It is initially characterized by memory loss, followed by a more general cognitive decline, inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and behavioral symptoms, such as wandering, agitation, depression and anxiety. </P>
<P>AD has become a major public health problem around the world due to its increasing prevalence, long duration, caregiver burden, and high financial cost of care. It is recently reported by the Alzheimer's Association that an estimated 5.1 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease in 2007, including 4.9 million people age 65 and over. The number of people age 65 and over with AD is estimated to be 7.7 million in 2030, a greater than 50% increase over the number currently affected (<LINK REF="REF-AD-Association-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AD Association 2007a</LINK>). In Canada, the prevalence of dementia was about 8% in 1991 among seniors over the age of 65 years and increased to 34% among those aged 85 years or more (<LINK REF="REF-CSHA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSHA 1994</LINK>). The age-standardized incidence of dementia in Canada has been estimated at 21.8 per thousand for females and 19.1 per thousand for males (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgarten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgarten 1994</LINK>). The prevalence of AD is expected to increase three- to four-fold in Canada during the next 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Brookmeyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brookmeyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USGAO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">USGAO 1998</LINK>) resulting in upwards of 10 million cases by the year 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Brookmeyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brookmeyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1990</LINK>). In China, the prevalence of AD varied considerably from 0.94% to 5.98% among those aged 60 years or older across different regions (<LINK REF="REF-He-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2001</LINK>). One 2004 study by Larson and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 2004</LINK>) noted that people newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's survived about half as long as those of a similar age who did not have the disease. The average survival time of a patient with AD was from four to six years after diagnosis, but survival can be as long as 20 years from first symptoms. In the USA, it is estimated that direct and indirect costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias, including Medicare and Medicaid costs and the indirect cost to business of employees who are caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's, amount to more than $148 billion annually (<LINK REF="REF-AD-Association-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">AD Association 2007b</LINK>). It has been estimated that a treatment that delays onset of the disease by just 12 months would decrease the number of persons afflicted with AD by 770,000 more than projected 50 years after initiation of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Brookmeyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brookmeyer 1998</LINK>). The impact of such a treatment on healthcare costs would be enormous, saving as much as US$36 billion per year (<LINK REF="REF-Brookmeyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brookmeyer 1998</LINK>). These factors justify the intensive efforts to treat or delay onset or progression of AD around the world. </P>
<P>Although there is currently no cure for AD, treatment options do exist. One of the hallmarks of the disease is the degeneration of acetylcholine-containing neurons in the basal forebrain (<LINK REF="REF-Rosler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosler 1999</LINK>); treatments have been focused on increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain. Cholinesterase inhibitors accomplish this by blocking the degradation of acetylcholine, thus increasing the efficacy of the remaining cholinergic neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehouse-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehouse 1981</LINK>). Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve some aspects of cognitive functioning and slow cognitive decline in patients with AD (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1991</LINK>). In addition, there are other possible therapeutic approaches based on neurotransmitter substitution or modulation including serotoninergic, noradrenergic substances or neuropeptides, and those acting on excitatory amino acid receptors such as glutamic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Emre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emre 2001</LINK>). There is evidence that enhancement of the excitatory action of L-glutamate plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Low affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type receptor antagonists might prevent excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity without interfering with the physiological actions of glutamate necessary for learning and memory (<LINK REF="REF-Cacabelos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cacabelos 1999</LINK>).The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far approved five drugs that temporarily slow worsening of symptoms for about 6 to 12 months, including tacrine (<LINK REF="REF-Gracon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gracon 1996</LINK>), donepezil (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006</LINK>), rivastigmine (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2000</LINK>), galantamine (<LINK REF="REF-Loy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loy 2006</LINK>) and memantine (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2006</LINK>). However, these drugs are not always effective and are expensive, especially for developing countries. This reality drives people to search for other modalities of treatment in an attempt to further improve the outcome of AD, including Chinese herbal medicines. </P>
<P>Huperzine A, derived from Chinese club moss Huperzia serrata, was isolated initially in China as a monomeric substance, a new Lycopodium alkaloid (Hup, [(5R, 9R, 11E)-5-amino-11-ethylidene-5, 6, 9, 10-tetrahydro-7-methyl-5, 9-methano-cycloocteno[b] pyridine-2(1H)-one]). It is a linearly competitive, reversible inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase that is said to have both central and peripheral activity with the ability to protect cells against hydrogen peroxide, beta-amyloid protein (or peptide), glutamate, ischemia and staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1985</LINK>). These reported protective effects might allow attenuation of oxidative stress, regulation of expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bax, P53 and caspase-3, protection of mitochondria, and interference with APP metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Liang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2005</LINK>). Animal and human studies have shown Huperzine A to be a promising agent for treating acetylcholine-deficit dementia (including AD) (<LINK REF="REF-Liang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1995</LINK>). Several clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999-a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) have been done over the past few years with Huperzine A for AD, showing that Huperzine A appears to offer benefits for some patients with AD without severe adverse effects. But these trials are small in sample size. Recently a report about the pharmacological treatment of dementia has been published by McMaster University Evidence-Based Practice Center (<LINK REF="REF-Santaguida-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santaguida 2004</LINK>), in which 186 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 97 drugs were summarized. This report stated that there was inconclusive evidence showing Huperzine A to be beneficial for AD. However, this report only included English-language randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1999</LINK>) and did not include trials published in non-English language, such as in Chinese. Therefore, we propose to perform a systematic review of Huperzine A, including clinical trials without language limitation, to determine whether the conclusions reached by analysis of English-only literature was valid or invalid and to provide the best available evidence for clinical practice and further research in Alzheimer's disease.<BR/> </P>

<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (Li J and Zhou RL) independently checked the titles and abstracts of trials for inclusion based on the selection criteria outlined previously. The full texts of the articles were retrieved if there was any doubt whether the article should be excluded or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third member (Wu HM) of the review team if necessary.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>No specific scoring system or checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Rather, the methodological quality of studies was documented using the following internal validity criteria in this review:</P>
<P>(1) Method of randomization: a method to generate the sequence of randomization was regarded as appropriate if it allowed each study participant to have the same chance of receiving each intervention and the investigators could not predict which treatment was next. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation were not regarded as appropriate. </P>
<P>(2) Concealment of allocation: scored A (adequate), B (unclear), or C (inadequate), following criteria adopted from the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook and Schulz et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).<BR/>A - Adequate measures to conceal allocation such as central randomization; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes or other description that contained convincing elements of concealment.<BR/>B - Unclearly concealed trials, in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all, or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A).<BR/>C - Inadequately concealed trials, in which the method of allocation was not concealed, such as alteration methods or use of case record numbers.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding (both of participants and outcome assessors): a study was regarded as double blind if the word "double blind" was used. The method was regarded as appropriate if it was stated that neither the person doing the assessments nor the study participant could identify the intervention being assessed, or if in the absence of such a statement the use of active placebos, identical placebos, or dummies was mentioned.</P>
<P>(4) Intention-to-treat analysis: whether an intention-to-treat analysis was possible on all patients from the published data (i.e. whether there were any exclusions from the trial after randomization), and the number of patients who were lost to follow-up. If there were no withdrawals, it should be stated in the article.</P>
<P>Quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers (Li J and Zhou RL) and disagreements reported and resolved by a third member (Wu HM). These criteria did not form exclusion criteria, and are described in the Table of Included Studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>Information on patients, methods, interventions, outcomes, and results were extracted independently by two reviewers (Li J and Zhou RL) using a self-developed data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by a third member (Wu HM) or through discussion. For dichotomous outcomes (such as all cause mortality, numbers experiencing adverse effects and so on), the number of participants experiencing the event and the total number of participants in each arm of the trial were extracted. For continuous outcomes (such as the change of cognitive function and behavior disturbance and QOL), the mean value and standard deviation for the changes in each arm of the trial were extracted along with the total number in each group.</P>
<P>Data on the number of patients with each outcome event and by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance or follow-up, were sought to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the above data were not available in the trial reports, additional information was sought by correspondence with the principal authors.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>For dichotomous outcomes (such as all cause mortality), results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using the fixed effects model unless there was evidence of heterogeneity. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (such as the change of cognitive function and behaviour disturbance, QOL, ADL), the weighted mean difference (WMD) was used, or the standardized mean difference (SMD) if different scales have been used or there were major differences between the trials as evidenced by heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was analyzed using a chi squared test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I<SUP>2</SUP> test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, treatments). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, sex, educational level, comorbidity and the severity of AD. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to the dose and duration of therapy. </P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of including<BR/>

<LI>only those trials which were double blinded.</LI>
</UL>
<P> <BR/>Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques. Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent.</P>
<P>Finally, if sufficient RCTs were identified, we planned to examine for publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>) using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Seventeen potentially eligible trials were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, six trials including a total of 454 patients met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>). Eleven trials were excluded because:<BR/> <BR/>(1) They did not diagnose AD according to ICD, DSM or NINCDS/ADRDA criteria (four trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Liu--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ye-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ye 2001</LINK>); <BR/>(2) They included non-AD dementia (three trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999-b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004-a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1991</LINK>); <BR/>(4) The types of intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria (one trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>);<BR/>(5) The comparisons between two groups were inappropriate (three trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Kuang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999-a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For details of each included trial, see the "Characteristics of Included Studies" table.</P>
<P>Of the six included trials, all were conducted in China. The mean age of participants ranged from 66 to 78 years, except <LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK> which did not give the mean age of patients. Of all the patients, men accounted for about 56%. All patients with AD were diagnosed using DSM criteria (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and/or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association) (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>). The average duration of AD was between 2.7 and 3.4 years in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>). The range of the duration of AD was from three months to 10 years in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>), and no information on the duration of AD was available from the remaining one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>). The severity on entry was mild to moderate in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) and mild to severe in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>) without a unified definition of severity. The remaining four trials did not report the severity of AD (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>). The trials varied considerably in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients with AD were usually excluded because of complications with other serious physical or psychotic problems. </P>
<P>Of the six included trials, four trials compared Huperzine A with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>), one trial compared Huperzine A plus Vitamin E with placebo plus Vitamin E (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>), and there were three compared arms in one trial (Huperzine A versus acupuncture and Huperzine A versus routine treatment ) (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>). The dose of Huperzine A ranged from 0.2 mg/day to 0.4 mg/day in all included trials. The usage of Huperzine A in each trial was by oral administration. The length of treatment period was from eight weeks to 36 weeks. Only one trial reported a dose titration period, i.e. Huperzine A group with 0.2 mg/day for the first week, then 0.3 mg/day for the second and third weeks before increasing the dose to 0.4 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most commonly reported outcomes were the mean score of global cognitive function (MMSE, HDS (Hasegawa Dementia Scale) and ADAS-Cog), specific cognitive function (Weshler Memory Scale, WMS), global clinical assessment [Clincial Dementia Rating (CDR), Clinician Interview-Based Impression (CIBIC-Plus)] and functional performance (activities of daily living, ADL) before and after treatment. There was no description of ADL scale used, but the total score of ADL was generally between 14 and 64 in the included studies. One trial measured the behavior disturbance using ADAS-non-Cog (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>). None of the six trials provided any information on death, quality of life and caregiver burden. One trial did not provide any information on the adverse events associated with Huperzine A (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>). The other five trials gave details of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>). The most common adverse events of Huperzine A were symptoms of cholinergic side effects, such as dizziness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, insomnia and somnolence. One trial indicated that one case in the Huperzine A group withdrew because of nausea and anorexia (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>), but there was no statistical difference between treatment and control groups. Another trial stated that two cases in the Huperzine A group withdrew because of nausea, anorexia and mild abdominal pain and there was no statistical difference between treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>). The remaining three trials just reported that the side effects of Huperzine A were mild without withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Method of randomization and concealment of allocation<BR/>
</B>The method of randomization provided adequate concealment of allocation in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) by using a center controlled randomized code. A randomization number table was used in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>), but the concealment of allocation was unclear. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>) used the randomization number table, but stated that the controlled patients were allocated according to patients' willingness. So whether a true randomization method was used was uncertain. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>) stated that patients were stratified according to gender and allocated by random sampling. Details of the methods of randomization remain unknown in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>).</P>

<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) used double-blinding methods in which participants and researchers were blinded. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>) used a single-blinding method in which outcome assessors were blinded. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>) stated that blinding was not used. </P>

<P>In general, with regard to the methodological quality, one of six included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) was relatively good and the remaining five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>) were fair or poor.<BR/> </P>

Abnormalities in ECG (e.g. cardiac ischemia or arrthymia) were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004b</LINK>) reported withdrawals due to adverse events (e.g. dizziness, nausea or vomiting, anorexia) in Huperzine A groups. Two trials with 168 patients comparing Huperzine A with placebo only reported the number of events of dizziness, nausea or vomiting and anorexia (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>). It was shown that these three cholinergic side effects were not statistically significant between groups, with ORs and corresponding 95% CIs of 0.85 (0.29, 2.47), 2.31 (0.58, 9.22) and 1.62 (0.51, 5.17), respectively. One trial with 103 patients comparing Huperzine A with placebo only reported the number of events of exciting, hyperactivity, nasal obstruction, diarrhea and insomnia (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>). It was shown that these cholinergic side effects were not statistically significant between groups (P &gt; 0.05). One trial with 28 patients comparing Huperzine A with placebo only reported ECG abnormalities and cholinergic side effects including dry mouth, constipation and drowsiness (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>). It was shown that there were no significant differences in ECG abnormalities (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.91) and the above-mentioned cholinergic side effects between groups (OR 12.43. 95% CI 0.60 to 256.66). One trial with 202 patients comparing Huperzine A plus Vitamin E with placebo plus Vitamin E (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) showed that there was no statistical significance of adverse events (e.g. nausea or vomiting, anorexia, insomnia, bradycardia, headache) between groups (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.18).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Six trials with a total of 454 patients were included in this review. Because all the included trials were conducted in China and no data from other country were available, the present review is not representative of different racial groups. </P>
<P>The results revealed that, compared with placebo, for patients with AD, Huperzine A significantly improves global cognitive function measured by MMSE and ADAS-Cog, global clinical assessment measured by CDR and CIBIC-plus, behavioral disturbance measured by ADAS-non-Cog and functional performance measured by ADL. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. The results were based on data from a single trial or several trials with a limited number of patients; most of trials were of fair or poor methodological quality with regard to method of randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of assessment except <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>. However, it should also be mentioned that <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK> was a confounded study (Huperzine A + Vitamin E versus placebo + Vitamin E). There may be a synergistic effect between Vitamin E and Huperzine. It is reported that Vitamin E is probably beneficial for the treatment of cognitive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Qizilbash-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qizilbash 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It seemed that there was no significant improvement of global cognitive function measured by HDS and specific cognitive function measured by WMS after Huperzine A treatment compared with placebo. It should be noted that the result was based on data from only two trials with a small number of patients (a total of 131 patients). Larger samples would be needed to detect moderate effects with any reliability. </P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) provided adequate concealment of allocation and only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) used a double-blind method. Therefore, the insufficient number of trials identified and their general low methodological quality prohibited meaningful sensitivity analysis to illuminate how robust the results of the review are. </P>
<P>It is known that the severity of AD has an influence on the effects of Huperzine A, as well as the dose and duration of Huperzine A. From the information available, it was not possible to perform pre-specified subgroup analyses comparing patients with different severity for each outcome, as well as comparing patients with different dose or duration for each outcome. This was due to the limited amount of data, the varied outcome measurements, or both, of the included studies. Moreover, in the meta-analysis, heterogeneity tests, analyzed using a chi squared on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I<SUP>2</SUP> test, all showed that heterogeneity was not found among the included studies.</P>
<P>The most important goal of treatment for AD is to reduce disability and to improve quality of life. There was a lack of data in the RCTs on quality of life. There was also a lack of data in the RCTs on caregiver burden. Therefore, we were not able to draw conclusions about these important outcomes. </P>
<P>The pharmacotherapy for AD is a long-term strategy, which requires drugs with few side effects. The longest course of therapy in the included studies was 36 weeks. But most of the included studies were of short duration (the shortest course was eight weeks), lacked follow-up data and did not report adverse events sufficiently or in a standardized way. According to the forthcoming evidence, it seemed that the adverse effects of Huperzine A were mild for the treatment of AD. However, it should be noted that this result was based on insufficient information from several trials with a small number of participants. Larger samples and long-term follow-up studies would be needed to detect the adverse effects with any reliability.</P>
<P>It was not possible to perform a funnel plot to assess the degree of publication bias in this systematic review because of the limited numbers of trials for each outcome. All the six included trials in this review were conducted in China and published in Chinese. Vickers and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>) found that some countries, including China, publish unusually high proportions of positive results. Although we have undertaken extensive searches for published material, we still could not exclude the possibility that studies with negative findings remain unpublished.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on this systematic review, it appears that Huperzine A may have positive effects on the improvement of general cognitive function, global clinical status, behavioral disturbance and functional performance, with no obvious serious adverse events in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately due to the low methodological quality of most included trials, small number of trials and probable publication bias, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Huperzine A for patients with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The promising results with less severe side effects and insufficient quality of the available trials warrant further research. Large sample and placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the available evidence. The following features should be addressed in further studies:</P>
<P>(1) Detailed reporting of the methods of randomization and allocation concealment;<BR/>(2) Application and clear description of blinding;<BR/>(3) Clear description of withdrawal and use of intention-to-treat analysis;<BR/>(4) Use of standard validated outcome measures;<BR/>(5) Reporting of clinically important outcome measures at long-term follow-up, such as mortality, disability, quality of life and caregiver burden; and <BR/>(6) Adverse events critically assessed by standardized reporting.</P>
