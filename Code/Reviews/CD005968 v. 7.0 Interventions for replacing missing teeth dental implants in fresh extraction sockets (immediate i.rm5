<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-02 15:24:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants can be placed in sockets just after tooth extraction (immediate implants) or after a couple of weeks up to a couple of months (immediate-delayed implants) or thereafter (delayed implants). This review looked at which was the best time to place dental implants and whether it would be advantageous to augment sites with gaps present at implant placement. It also tried to determine the most effective bone augmentation procedure.</P>
<P>The seven identified studies included too few patients to answer the questions. Four studies evaluated which is the best time to place implants. One study evaluated whether bone grafting is advantageous at implant placement and two studies evaluated which are the best grafting techniques.</P>
<P>There is currently too little evidence to draw any reliable conclusions, however, the aesthetic outcome could be slightly better when placing implants early after tooth extraction, though early placed implants might be at a higher risk of failure. There is not enough evidence supporting or refusing the need of bone augmentation when extracted teeth are immediately replaced with dental implants, nor it is known whether any augmentation procedure is better than the others. Bone substitutes (anorganic bovine bone) can be used instead of self generated (autogenous) bone graft.</P>

<P>'Immediate' implants are placed in dental sockets just after tooth extraction. 'Immediate-delayed' implants are those implants inserted after weeks up to about a couple of months to allow for soft tissue healing. 'Delayed' implants are those placed thereafter in partially or completely healed bone. The potential advantages of immediate implants are that treatment time can be shortened and that bone volumes might be partially maintained thus possibly providing good aesthetic results. The potential disadvantages are an increased risk of infection and failures. After implant placement in postextractive sites, gaps can be present between the implant and the bony walls. It is possible to fill these gaps and to augment bone simultaneously to implant placement. There are many techniques to achieve this but it is unclear when augmentation is needed and which could be the best augmentation technique.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-02 15:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges permitting restoration of chewing function, speech, and aesthetics. Dental implants offer an alternative. These implants are inserted into the jawbones to support a dental prosthesis and are retained because of the intimacy of bone growth on to their surface. This direct structural and functional connection between living bone and implant surface, termed osseointegration, was first described by <LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>
<B> </B>and has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 30 years.</P>
<P>Teeth may have been lost through dental disease or trauma or they may be congenitally absent. However in many clinical situations compromised teeth or roots may still be present in the patient's mouth. Traditionally, before placing dental implants, compromised teeth were removed and the extraction sockets were left to heal for between several months and 1 year. However, the great majority of patients are interested in shortening the treatment time between tooth extraction and implant placement, or even better in having the implants inserted during the same session as the teeth are extracted (immediate implants). This would result in patients having fewer surgical sessions and shorter treatment periods. Another potential advantage with immediate implants is that the amount of bone loss which physiologically occurs during the remodeling phase of the extraction socket might be reduced if the implant is placed early during the healing process. Finally, it may not even be necessary to raise a flap in several situations when placing dental implants. On the other hand there are also some potential disadvantages with immediate implants such as: (1) an enhanced risk of infections and the associated failures if the socket becomes infected (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenquist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenquist 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takeshita-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeshita 1997</LINK>); (2) the mismatch between the implant surface and the socket wall, therefore gaps may be present after implantation since dental roots do not have a regular circular diameter shape (it is also possible that one or more bony socket walls are partly resorbed either due to the disease processes or damaged as a result of the tooth extraction procedure); (3) the necessity of raising a flap for covering the implants, if a two-stage implantation procedure is preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenquist-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenquist 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>These potential problems have been tackled in different ways. Manufacturers have designed specific implant systems to be used as immediate implants having various troncoconical shapes and different diameters in order to be used in sockets of varying dimensions (<LINK REF="REF-Gomez_x002d_Roman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez-Roman 1997</LINK>). Some dentists wait for some time, generally 2 to 8 weeks, before placing the implants, in order to achieve some soft tissue healing and decrease the risk of infections (immediate-delayed implants).</P>
<P>Depending on the degree of damage of the extraction socket and of the shape as well as the diameter of the extracted root, some portion of the implants could remain exposed and/or there might remain a residual gap between the implant and the bony wall. Since alveolar bone will remodel after tooth extraction, the degree of bone resorption is difficult to predict and could leave some portion of the implants exposed, determining a poor aesthetic outcome. In order to prevent this problem it has been suggested to augment the socket just after implant placement using various bone augmentation techniques such as autogenous bone grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Becker-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1994a</LINK>), bone substitutes (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yukna-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yukna 1991</LINK>), guided bone regeneration (GBR) with resorbable (<LINK REF="REF-Lazzara-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazzara 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Becker-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenquist-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenquist 2000</LINK>) or non-resorbable barriers, and various bone promoting molecules such as enamel matrix derivative (<LINK REF="REF-Cangini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cangini 2005</LINK>), platelet rich plasma (PRP), growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in order to accelerate and increment bone formation. However, it is unclear whether bone augmentation procedures are of any benefit for immediate implants, since immediate and immediate-delayed implants can be successful and heal properly without any bone graft procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Covani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covani 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A few reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fugazzotto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugazzotto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schropp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schropp 2008</LINK>) evaluating the efficacy of immediate implants, have been published over the years but so far evidence was inconclusive. It would be of great benefit to know whether the number of surgical sessions, treatment time and patient discomfort may be reduced using immediate implants without compromising the success of the implant therapy, and if and when bone augmentation could be beneficial, by conducting a rigorous systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>

<P>Details of the journals being handsearched by the Cochrane Oral Health Group's ongoing programme are given on the website: <A HREF="http://www.ohg.cochrane.org">www.ohg.cochrane.org</A>.<BR/>The following journals have been identified as being potentially important to be handsearched for this review: <I>British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</I>, <I>Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research</I>, <I>Clinical Oral Implants Research</I>, <I>European Journal of Oral Implantology</I>, <I>Implant Dentistry</I>, <I>International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants</I>, <I>International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</I>, <I>International Journal of Periodontics and Restorative Dentistry</I>, <I>International Journal of Prosthodontics</I>, <I>Journal of Clinical Periodontology</I>, <I>Journal of Dental Research</I>, <I>Journal of Oral Implantology</I>, <I>Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</I>, <I>Journal of Periodontology</I>, <I>Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry</I>. Where these have not already been searched as part of the Cochrane Journal Handsearching Programme, the journals were handsearched by one review author up to the month in which the last electronic search was undertaken.</P>
<P>The bibliographies of all identified RCTs and relevant review articles were checked for studies outside the handsearched journals. Personal references were also searched.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently by two review authors to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent validity assessment and data extraction. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table, and reasons for exclusion recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as required before use. Any disagreement was discussed and a third review author consulted where necessary. All authors were contacted for clarification or missing information.</P>
<P>For each trial the following data were recorded.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Year of publication, country of origin and source of study funding.</LI>
<LI>Details of the participants including demographic characteristics, source of recruitment and criteria for inclusion.</LI>
<LI>Details of the type of intervention.</LI>
<LI>Details of the outcomes reported, including method of assessment, and time intervals.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measure of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group using mean differences and 95% CIs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The statistical unit was the patient and not the prosthesis or implant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>All trial authors were contacted to retrieve missing data where necessary. Data were excluded until further clarification was available if agreement could not be reached. Methods for estimating missing standard deviations in section 7.7.3 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) will be used. An ITT analysis was undertaken if data available and appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and heterogeneity would have been considered significant if P &lt; 0.1. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, was used to quantify heterogeneity with I<SUP>2 </SUP>over 50% being considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there had been sufficient numbers of trials (more than 10) in any meta-analysis publication bias would have been assessed according to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). If asymmetry was identified we would have examined possible causes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures a meta-analysis was done. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using fixed-effect models. Random-effects models were to be used if there were more than three studies in the meta-analysis. Data from split-mouth studies were to be combined with data from parallel group trials with the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan.<B> </B>Numbers needed to treat (NNT) were to be calculated for patients affected by implant failures. The Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) recommendations were followed for studies with zero-cell counts. The fixed value of 0.5 was added to all cells with zero-cell counts and risk ratios calculated with the RevMan software. If there were no events in both arms, no calculations were undertaken because in this situation the study does not provide any indication of the direction or magnitude of the relative treatment effect.</P>
<P>For the Visual Analogue Scores where the median and interquartile range were presented, and the data were not skewed, the standard deviation was estimated as the width of the interquartile range/1.35.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was to be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. No hypotheses, to be investigated for subgroup analyses, were formulated, however this may be done in future updates of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the study quality assessment on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined. There were too few trials to undertake these analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other issues&#8217;). Each domain includes one specific entry in a &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicates low risk of bias, &#8216;No&#8217; indicates high risk of bias, and &#8216;Unclear&#8217; indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. In the case that the paper to be assessed had one or more review authors in the authors list, it was independently evaluated only by those review authors not involved in the trials.</P>

<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>) compared immediate (same day) versus delayed (3 months on average) implants after extractions of periapically infected single teeth. Twenty-five patients were included in each group. Implants were placed 2 mm below the cervical junction of the adjacent teeth. Autogenous bone grafts from the trigonum retromolar or chin region were covered with a bioresorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) in all patients and implants were submerged and left healing for 6 months. Single crowns were cemented with temporary cement. All implants were Frialit-2 Synchro (Dentsply Friadent Ceramed, Mannheim, Germany).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>) compared single immediate (same day) versus delayed (4 months) implants in maxillary anterior sites up to premolars. Seventy-six patients were recruited and randomised, however it was not specified how many in each group. The implant&#8217;s axis of immediate implants was directed palatal to the planned incisal edge, and at least 2 mm palatal to the emergence line angle. The implant was placed with the coronal surface of the implant 3 mm apical to the gingival margin of the planned restoration. The length of the implants was 13 mm except when the maxillary sinus limited the implant length to 11.5 mm. When a gap was present between the implant and the labial bone, a graft of human mineralised bone was used to graft the site and preserve the width of the ridge. Immediate implants were immediately provisionalised with acrylic crowns not in occlusion, whereas delayed sites were grafted with human mineralised bone (350 to 500 micron, cortical, freeze-dried, U Miami Tissue Bank, Miami, FL, USA). After the graft had been compressed, a piece of collagen (Collaplug; Zimmer Dental, Carlsbad, CA) was placed over the graft and under the margins of the labial and palatal gingiva. 4-0 Chromic sutures were placed in a horizontal mattress fashion to gently conform the gingiva to the collagen. After a healing period of 4 months, implants were placed and immediately temporised. Four months after implant placement final restorations were made. All implants were straight wall design, threaded, with a roughened surface, and a parallel type abutment implant interface (Certain Implant; Biology of Metals 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA).</LI>

<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schropp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schropp 2003</LINK>) compared immediate-delayed (10 days on average) versus delayed implants (3 months on average) after extractions of compromised single teeth. Twenty-three patients were included in each group. Implants were placed with the top of the cover screw even with the bone ridge. Autogenous bone grafting was done when implants threads were exposed at abutment connection for immediate-delayed implants and at both implant placement and at abutment connection for delayed implants. Implants were submerged and left to heal for about 3 months. Single-tooth metal-ceramic crowns were provided. All implants were Osseotite (3i Implant Innovations Inc, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA).</LI>

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schropp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schropp 2003</LINK>), an experienced prosthodontist, who had not been involved in the treatment and blind to the interventions, evaluated the clinical photographs of the single crowns which included one adjacent tooth from each side. Photographs were done 1 week after seating of the prosthetic restoration and 16 to 18 months later. The following parameters were evaluated: (a) the interproximal papilla dimensions, assessed as 0 = no papilla or negative papilla; 1 = less than half of the height of the proximal area occupied by soft tissue; 2 = at least half of the height of the proximal area occupied by soft tissue; (b) clinical crown height, assessed as: 1 = too long; 2 = too short; 3 = appropriate in relation to the level of the marginal mucosa when compared to that of the adjacent teeth, rather than the incisal/occlusal extension of the crown. The papilla score was dichotomised as 2 (good outcome) or not. The crown length was also dichotomised as appropriate (score 3) or not. In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palattella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palattella 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>), the interproximal gingival papillae was evaluated according to the papilla score (<LINK REF="REF-Jemt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemt 1998</LINK>): 0 = no papillae; 1 = less than one half of the gingival embrasure; 2 = at least one half of the height; 3 = complete closure of the proximal space; 4 = overgrowth. We dichotomised this outcome into 0, 1 and 4 as negative outcome, and 2 to 3 as positive outcome, and evaluated the proportion for the negative outcome. The mid-buccal gingival level (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>) was assessed by measuring the difference with the buccal gingival outline of the adjacent teeth: 0 = no difference in gingival level; 1 = less than 1 mm difference; 2 = less than 2 mm difference; 3 = less than 3 mm difference; 4 = differences in buccal gingival outline greater than 3 mm. We dichotomised this outcome into 0 to 1 (= positive outcome) and 2 to 4 (= negative outcome) and evaluated the proportion for the negative outcome. The papilla score could not be evaluated in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Palattella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palattella 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>) since data were presented in a way we could not use. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>) the operator assessed whether marginal mucosal recession occurred or not. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Palattella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palattella 2008</LINK>) the position of mucosal margin was measured by the operator as the distance in mm from the most apical point of the gingival margin to the implant shoulder measured in mm with the aid of a periodontal probe.

<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>) of parallel group design compared immediate versus delayed implants in periapical infected sites. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in each group and none dropped out. All patients were bone grafted at implant placement and subjected to a regenerative therapy with resorbable membranes. Two early implant failures occurred in the immediate group, however the authors informed us that no complication occurred.

Seventy-six patients were enrolled and 16 dropped out or were excluded but it was not described from which group. When a gap was present at immediate implants, the site was grafted with human mineralised bone. Immediate implants were immediately provisionalised with non-occluding temporary acrylic crowns, whereas delayed sites were grafted with human mineralised bone and left to heal for 4 months before placing the implants. Two years after loading, four implants failed in the immediate group versus one in the delayed group and this was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schropp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schropp 2003</LINK>) of parallel group design compared immediate-delayed versus delayed implant placement up to 5 years after loading. Twenty-three patients were enrolled in each group. Two patients withdrew, one from each group, because they did not pay for the implant crown at the 1-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up more drop-out/withdrawals occurred: two<B> </B>from the immediate-delayed group (one excluded because the implant was used to support a removable denture and one because the crown was remade) and five from the delayed group (one excluded since treated with a bridge and not a single crown, one because the crown was remade, three did not want to attend the 5-years examination, though their implant supported crowns were still in place without causing any inconvenience). At implant placement six patients out of 10, having bone dehiscence, of the delayed group were bone grafted versus none of the immediate-delayed group. At abutment connection six out of 15 patients with bone dehiscence of the immediate-delayed group and four out of 11 of the delayed group were bone grafted. The consequence of these bone grafting procedures on the final results are difficult to evaluate since only some patients with dehiscence were actually grafted. Three early implant failures occurred, two in the immediate-delayed group and one in the delayed group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Four postoperative minor complications occurred all in the immediate-delayed group: one fistula in relation to remnants of cement at the implant-abutment joint (after meticulous scaling the fistula disappeared but the patient suffered from a bad taste originating from the perimplant mucosa), two cases of temporarily sensibility disturbances which recovered within 1 month, and one minor postoperative bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The following additional complications occurred up to the fifth year: five in the immediate-delayed group (one crown was remade, two crown recementations, one case with several recementations, one case with metal margin of the implant restoration exposed) and two in the delayed group (one crown was remade and one crown was recemented). After 2 years there were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and implant failures (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), complications (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), aesthetics assessed by the patient (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>), the papilla height assessed by the dentist (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>), and marginal bone level changes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>). There was a statistically significant difference with patients in the delayed group perceiving the period between tooth extraction and insertion of the crown significantly longer than patients in the immediate-delayed group, mean difference of visual analogue scale (VAS) -20.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -33.36 to -7.24) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).

No patients dropped out. Two complications occurred in the group treated with autogenous bone: one abscess that determined the early failure of the implant and one wound dehiscence.

<LI>One trial compared 10 patients receiving Bio-Oss versus 10 patients receiving Bio-Oss plus a resorbable barrier at immediate single implants placed in fresh extraction sockets at maxillary anterior or premolar sites (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>) up to 3 years post-loading. A third control group of 10 patients who received no barrier and no graft could not be evaluated since some patients were systematically excluded from that group and included in the remaining two groups. The following bone measurements at implant placement and 6 months after implant exposure were included in the present review: the vertical height of the defect (VDH) measured from the most apical extent of the defect to the coronal aspect of the implant collar, and the horizontal depth of the defect (HDD) measured bucco-lingually from the most buccal extent of the implant collar to the labial bone crest (at dehisced sites, the HDD was estimated by measuring the horizontal distance from the implant collar to a periodontal probe placed against the intact portions of the labial plate at the level of the implant collar). After 3 years, three patients dropped out from the Bio-Oss group and five patients from the Bio-Oss plus barrier group. There were no prosthesis or implant failures. Two complications occurred in the Bio-Oss plus barrier group: one abscess developed during the healing period around one implant (the site was re-treated with the same procedure); another implant displayed a chronic inflammation of the perimplant tissues (perimplant mucositis) for the entire study period (<LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>). All treatments resulted in statistically significant bone gain, however, no statistically significant differences in bone gain were found between the two procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-005.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.8</LINK>). After delivery of the prostheses one patient in each group, when asked by the operator, was dissatisfied with aesthetics due to recession of the mucosa on the buccal aspect. Both patients refused a corrective intervention with a soft tissue graft. Aesthetics (position of the soft tissue margin in relation to the adjacent teeth) were also evaluated by the operator after the 6-month healing period, at placement of the final restorations and after 3 years of loading. After healing, 3/10 sites treated with Bio-Oss and 4/10 sites treated with Bio-Oss plus barrier were considered aesthetically unsatisfactory by the operator. The two sites which were judged as unsatisfactory by the patients, were also judged unsatisfactory by the operator. The operator then treated two sites with recession in the Bio-Oss group and one patient with recession and one without recession (marginal mucosa judged to be too thin) in the Bio-Oss plus barrier group with connective tissue grafts. After placement of the final restorations (about 2 months after), the operator judged aesthetics to be poor in 2/10 patients of the Bio-Oss group and in 4/10 of the Bio-Oss plus barrier group. After 3 years of loading, the operator judged aesthetics to be poor in 2/7 patients of the Bio-Oss group and in 2/5 patients of the Bio-Oss plus barrier group. No statistically significant differences were found for any of the aesthetic outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>). With respect to treatment time, the differences among groups may not be clinically significant. The only difference in cost between the two procedures was the additional cost of the barrier. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 16:45:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only four trials comparing different timing for implant placement could be included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Schropp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schropp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palattella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palattella 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>). Different timings for implant placement after tooth extraction were evaluated, however all trials were underpowered, therefore only limited indications can be gained from them.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>) comparing immediate versus delayed implants found no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures, though trends clearly suggested that more implant failures occurred at immediate implants (6 versus 1). No other meta-analysis could be done, nor other outcome was significant. According to the authors of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>), there was 1 mm more recession of buccal soft tissues at delayed implants. This is plausible but since data were not clearly presented in the study, we were unable to evaluate this outcome as well as other outcomes that they presented. It was disappointing that limitations in data reporting in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Block-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2009</LINK>) did not allow us to conduct additional meta-analyses. This could have been easily obviated if the trial authors had answered our request for information.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schropp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schropp 2003</LINK>) compared immediate-delayed implants placed on average 10 days after extraction with delayed implants placed on average 3 months after extractions. After 2 years patients in the delayed group perceived the period between tooth extraction and insertion of the crown significantly longer and were less satisfied. Moreover an independent blinded assessor judged the level of the perimplant marginal mucosa in relation to that of the adjacent teeth as more appropriate in the immediate-delayed group. The possible biological explanation is that the early implant placement decreased resorption of the alveolar bone. In other words, the implants may have contributed to maintaining the alveolar bone height with a perceived aesthetic benefit. However after 5 years all these differences disappeared, but complications become statistically more common for immediate-delayed implants. These findings are difficult to interpret also because there were many drop-outs that reduced the sample size. Data interpretation is further complicated by the fact that the authors withdrew several patients from the study. No patient should have been withdrawn from the study, according to the principle of the intention-to-treat analysis, allowing the readers to draw their conclusions, and avoiding unnecessary bias.</P>
<P>The study comparing immediate and immediate-delayed implants (<LINK REF="STD-Palattella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palattella 2008</LINK>), though well conducted, included only eight patients per group. Such a small sample size does not allow for any reliable conclusion, since the probability to find a difference, if any, is remote.</P>
<P>Regarding the need for bone augmentation procedures at implant placement, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005b</LINK>) evaluated whether they could be advantageous or not. The trial tested in 26 patients augmentation with autogenous bone collected from the implant site. It was underpowered to detect any difference, however all failures (two) and complications (two) occurred in the augmented group. A second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>) including a control group not subject to augmentation could not be used because the authors subverted the randomisation, allocating preferentially patients with buccal defect to the augmentation arms of the study.</P>
<P>Five different augmentation procedures were tested in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>) including<B> </B>56 patients. By dividing the few patients into five different groups, the authors eliminated the already scarce possibility to find any possible statistically significant difference, therefore the findings were inconclusive.</P>
<P>The only trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cornelini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cornelini 2004</LINK>) showing some statistically significant difference was excluded from this review update because it was decided to include only trials having a follow-up of at least 1 year after loading. This trial, having a follow-up to abutment connection/implant loading, compared 10 patients with an immediate postextractive implant covered by a resorbable barrier versus 10 patients treated with a resorbable barrier plus anorganic bovine bone (Bio-Oss) at implants placed in fresh extraction sockets. No failures, complications or drop-outs occurred. A statistically significant higher position of the soft tissue margins in relation to the implant shoulder was found at the buccal aspects of implants treated with barrier plus Bio-Oss (2.1 mm versus 0.9 mm; mean difference = -1.2 mm; 95% confidence interval -2.29 to -0.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Cornelini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cornelini 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>With respect to generalisation of the results of the present review to general practice, failures and complications at immediate postextractive implants were slightly higher. Caution is therefore recommended when deciding to place implants immediately after tooth extraction. The first question that clinicians should ask themselves is what are the added benefits for the patient by having immediate implants. Then the expected benefits need to be carefully weighed against the risk of complications of the chosen procedures.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants, therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias. There is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risk of implant failures and complications than delayed implants; on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction. There is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques are superior to the others.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-02 16:48:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a definite need for randomised controlled trials evaluating the best timing for placing dental implants after teeth extractions. These trials must be powered to detect a difference for primary outcomes such as prosthesis/implant success and complications, should evaluate objective aesthetic outcomes assessed by blind outcome assessors and the patient's own perception of aesthetics, and should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org</A>). We also need to understand when bone augmentation procedures are needed and which are the most effective. Trials evaluating the efficacy of non/slow resorbable bone substitutes in alternative to autogenous bone should be prioritised.</P>

<P>Single immediate (same day) versus delayed (4 months) implants in maxillary anterior sites up to premolars. The implant&#8217;s axis of immediate implants was directed palatal to the planned incisal edge, and at least 2 mm palatal to the emergence line angle. The implant was placed with the coronal surface of the implant 3 mm apical to the gingival margin of the planned restoration. The length of the implants was 13 mm except when the maxillary sinus limited the implant length to 11.5 mm. When a gap was present between the implant and the labial bone, a graft of human mineralised bone was used to graft the site and preserve the width of the ridge. Immediate implants were immediately provisionalised with acrylic crowns not in occlusion, whereas delayed sites were grafted with human mineralised bone (350 to 500 micron, cortical, freeze-dried, U Miami Tissue Bank, Miami, FL, USA). After the graft had been compressed, a piece of collagen (Collaplug; Zimmer Dental, Carlsbad, CA) was placed over the graft and under the margins of the labial and palatal gingiva. 4-0 Chromic sutures were placed in a horizontal mattress fashion to gently conform the gingiva to the collagen. After a healing period of 4 months, implants were placed and immediately temporised. Four months after implant placement final restorations were made. All implants were straight wall design, threaded, with a roughened surface, and a parallel type abutment implant interface (Certain Implant; Biology of Metals 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA).</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>From the article: &#8220;The study statistician provided a computer-generated randomization schedule. Patients were assigned to 1 prosthodontist and then randomly assigned to either treatment group using a generalized randomized block design. The randomization scheme used ensured that balance was achieved with respect to the number of patients receiving a given treatment both within and across blocks. This balance was accomplished by randomising treatments to patients in groups of 6.&#8221;</P>
