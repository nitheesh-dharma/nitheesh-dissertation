<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-10 11:17:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Individuals with SAnD often experience intense fear, avoidance, and distress in unfamiliar social situations. There is evidence that medications are useful in minimising these symptoms.</P>
<P>
<B>Who will be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>- People with SAnD.</P>
<P>- Families and friends of people who suffer from anxiety disorders.</P>
<P>- General practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pharmacists.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>- Is pharmacotherapy an effective form of treatment for SAnD in adults?</P>
<P>- Is medication effective and tolerable for people in terms of side effects?</P>
<P>- Which factors (methodological or clinical) predict response to pharmacotherapy?</P>
<P>
<B>Which studies were included in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We included studies comparing medication with placebo for the treatment of SAnD in adults.</P>
<P>We included 66 trials in the review, with a total of 11,597 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>There was evidence of benefit that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more effective than placebo, although the evidence was of very low quality. There was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), and benzodiazepines, even though the evidence was low in quality. The anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin also showed moderate-quality evidence of a clinical response. We did not observe this effect for the remaining medication classes. The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. There was low-quality evidence that more people taking SSRIs and SNRIs dropped out due to side effects than those taking placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low.</P>
<P>For the outcome of SAnD symptom severity, there was evidence of benefit for SSRIs, the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine, MAOIs, RIMAs, benzodiazepines, the antipsychotic olanzapine, and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) atomoxetine, but most of the evidence was of very low quality. SSRIs and RIMAs reduced depression symptoms, and SSRIs reduced functional disability across all domains.</P>
<P>We also observed response to long-term treatment with SSRIs (based on low-quality evidence), MAOIs (based on very low-quality evidence), and RIMAs (based on moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>What should happen next?</B>
</P>
<P>Most evidence for treatment efficacy is related to SSRIs. Nevertheless, SSRI trials were associated with very low-quality evidence and high risk of publication bias. It would be useful for future studies to evaluate the treatment of SAnD in people with comorbid disorders, including substance use disorders. Trials that provide adequate information on randomisation and allocation concealment are needed.</P>

<P>Recognition is growing that social anxiety disorder (SAnD) is a chronic and disabling disorder, and data from early trials demonstrate that medication may be effective in its treatment. This systematic review is an update of an earlier review of pharmacotherapy of SAnD.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-04-12 09:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and identify which factors (methodological or clinical) predict response to treatment.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-10 07:41:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR-Studies and CCMDCTR-References) to 17 August 2015. The CCMDCTR contains reports of relevant RCTs from MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and CENTRAL (all years). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We updated the search in August 2017 and placed additional studies in Awaiting Classification, these will be incorporated in the next version of the review, as appropriate.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-27 09:18:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy versus placebo in the treatment of SAnD in adults.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-27 09:18:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors (TW and JI) assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion for this review update. We extracted descriptive, methodological and outcome information from each trial, contacting investigators for missing information where necessary. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided) and undertook subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-10 11:17:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 66 RCTs in the review (&gt; 24 weeks; 11,597 participants; age range 18 to 70 years) and 63 in the meta-analysis. For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found very low-quality evidence of treatment response for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (number of studies (k) = 24, risk ratio (RR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.85, N = 4984). On this outcome there was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (k = 4, RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.75, N = 235), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) (k = 8, RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55, N = 1270), and the benzodiazepines (k = 2, RR 4.03; 95% CI 2.45 to 6.65, N = 132), although the evidence was low quality. We also found clinical response for the anticonvulsants with gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogues (k = 3, RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.20, N = 532; moderate-quality evidence). The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. We assessed tolerability of SSRIs and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine on the basis of treatment withdrawal; this was higher for medication than placebo (SSRIs: k = 24, RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.97 to 3.39, N = 5131, low-quality evidence; venlafaxine: k = 4, RR 3.23; 95% CI 2.15 to 4.86, N = 1213, moderate-quality evidence), but there were low absolute rates of withdrawal for both these medications classes compared to placebo. We did not find evidence of a benefit for the rest of the medications compared to placebo.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of SAnD symptom severity, there was benefit for the SSRIs, the SNRI venlafaxine, MAOIs, RIMAs, benzodiazepines, the antipsychotic olanzapine, and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) atomoxetine in the reduction of SAnD symptoms, but most of the evidence was of very low quality. Treatment with SSRIs and RIMAs was also associated with a reduction in depression symptoms. The SSRIs were the only medication class that demonstrated evidence of reduction in disability across a number of domains.</P>
<P>We observed a response to long-term treatment with medication for the SSRIs (low-quality evidence), for the MAOIs (very low-quality evidence) and for the RIMAs (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found evidence of treatment efficacy for the SSRIs, but it is based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence. Tolerability of SSRIs was lower than placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low.</P>
<P>While a small number of trials did report treatment efficacy for benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, MAOIs, and RIMAs, readers should consider this finding in the context of potential for abuse or unfavourable side effects.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:05:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:05:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-27 09:45:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAnD) have long been recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 1966</LINK>), the disorder only appeared within the official psychiatric nomenclature relatively recently (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_III-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-III 1980</LINK>). Diagnostic criteria for SAnD in the third edition of the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</I> (DSM-III) encouraged research on its epidemiology, psychobiology, and treatment. Subsequent epidemiological research determined that the disorder is highly prevalent in a wide range of settings, that it is characterised by significant chronicity and comorbidity, and that it is associated with marked functional impairment, including academic, occupational, marital, and social dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2008</LINK>). Such data allay skepticism about whether SAnD is really a medical disorder and support the importance of pharmacotherapy for its treatment.</P>
<P>SAnD usually begins in childhood or adolescence, with studies reporting lifetime prevalence rates of between 3% and 16% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK>). Some European studies describe a one-year prevalence of 2% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Wancata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wancata 2009</LINK>). Typically, individuals with SAnD experience severe, intense fear of drawing attention to themselves in unfamiliar social situations or negative evaluation in situations that are potentially embarrassing or humiliating. This in turn results in avoiding the phobic situation or tolerating it with extreme distress. The affected individual recognises this fear as unreasonable, excessive, and more than mere shyness. These symptoms may take the form of a situationally predisposed panic attack and always impair functioning on a number of levels (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a growing body of work demonstrating that SAnD is mediated by specific neurocircuitry, with serotonergic and dopaminergic systems particularly relevant (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002d</LINK>), providing a rationale for the use of pharmacotherapy. The glutamatergic and noradrenergic systems, as well as substance P, may also be implicated in the neurological basis of SAnD, suggesting a role for agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Pande-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pande 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pande-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pande 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tauscher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tauscher 2010</LINK>). Indeed there is accumulating evidence that particular medications are effective in the management of SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in managing SAnD is also receiving increasing empirical support (<LINK REF="REF-Dorrepaal-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorrepaal 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedoroff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedoroff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1997</LINK>), and current expert consensus is that both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have a role in the management of this disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2015</LINK>). Interestingly, both CBT and pharmacotherapy are able to normalise functional neuroanatomical abnormalities in SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Furmark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furmark 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, this review focuses exclusively on pharmacotherapy interventions.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-11 11:45:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research has evaluated a range of medications for SAnD.

<P>Although the pathophysiology of SAnD is incompletely understood, various mono-aminergic systems, such as the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic systems, may play a role in mediating SAnD symptoms. Strongly serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs have specific activity in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, with minimal direct effects on norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. This inhibition of reuptake increases the bio-available concentration of serotonin, which then binds to and activates various receptors. Clinical efficacy is observed with 70% to 80% occupancy of serotonin transporters (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). SNRIs are potent inhibitors of the reuptake of catecholamines but weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake (<LINK REF="STD-Rickels-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickels 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). The putative effects of the selective NARI atomoxetine on the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system in adults and children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reported by <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Michelson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelson 2001</LINK>, suggest potential use for anxiety and mood disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest that some serotonin-dopamine antagonists (SDAs) such as quetiapine and olanzapine may possess anxiolytic properties, and they may potentially have a role in treatment-resistant SAnD (<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaishnavi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vaishnavi 2007</LINK>). Nefazodone is an agent with both pre- and postsynaptic serotonin reuptake inhibition, but concerns about hepatotoxicity limit its use in clinical practice (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameringen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameringen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>MAOIs increase biogenic amine neurotransmitter levels by inhibiting their degradation, facilitating presynaptic reuptake of these chemicals through specific transporter molecules and inhibiting their de-amination in mitochondria by the enzyme MAO. This inhibition may be either reversible or irreversible (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). RIMAs are generally safer and better tolerated than MAOIs and have shown efficacy in treating SAnD (<LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1992</LINK>). The drug functions by selectively binding to a specific isoenzyme of monoamine oxidase (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists block catecholamines released in the stress response, thus potentially reducing the physiological symptoms associated with SAnD. This may then enable the individual to function with fewer objective signs of anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Liebowitz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Liebowitz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner--1994" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1994</LINK>). The NaSSA mirtazepine has potent action on central adrenergic receptors, leading to a net increase in noradrenaline and serotonin, without the unwanted activation of cholinergic receptors (<LINK REF="STD-Muehlbacher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Muehlbacher 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of many anxiety disorders is consistent with the hypothesized role of GABA in these conditions. In low doses, benzodiazepines act as anxiolytic agents and may be especially useful in providing rapid control of anxiety symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Gorman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pecknold-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecknold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). Repeated buspirone treatment may desensitise inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors and this, together with its modest postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist actions, could lead to an overall increase in 5-HT neurotransmission as well (<LINK REF="REF-Cowen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The anticonvulsant pregabalin reduces the release of norepinephrine, glutamate, and substance P from the brain and spinal cord and may have a benefit in anxiety reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Pande-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pande 2004</LINK>). Gabapentin may be similarly effective for these conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Stephen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephen 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Newer medications such as GW876008 have corticotropin-releasing factors (CRFs) that target behavioural, autonomic, and neurochemical responses linked to a variety of anxiety and stress-related disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2011</LINK>). GW876008 also plays a role in the activation of the hypothalamus in patients with anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:05:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of pharmacotherapy studies may be useful in tackling several questions for the field. First, is pharmacotherapy in fact an effective form of treatment in SAnD? Given scepticism about SAnD diagnosis and the importance of psychological models and psychotherapy studies for the disorder, the role of pharmacotherapy remains moot for some. For those who accept the role of pharmacotherapy, questions remain about the appropriate dose and duration of treatments. Although in the late 1990s expert consensus suggested continuing pharmacotherapy for at least a year, there was arguably relatively little data to support this conclusion at the time (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, are particular medication classes more effective in treating symptoms, more tolerable to the patient in terms of adverse events, or both? The use of recently introduced antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) for SAnD has raised the question of how these agents compare with older medications (e.g. MAOIs). Current expert consensus has suggested that in view of their efficacy and tolerability, SSRIs should be considered as first-line medications for the treatment of SAnD, while beta-blockers have a role in the management of performance anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2015</LINK>); it is important to determine whether such recommendations are supported by evidence from RCTs.</P>
<P>Third, can a systematic review of RCTs provide information about the most important variables affecting pharmacotherapy response? Methodological factors such as the number of participating centres or the duration of the trial may affect treatment outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002c</LINK>). Some authors have also suggested that clinical factors such as the nature of the SAnD sub-type present (e.g. generalised versus non-generalised), and the severity of baseline symptoms, may play a role (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002c</LINK>). The body of evidence from RCTs may provide more conclusive information about the predictors of pharmacotherapy response in this disorder.</P>
<P>Indeed, a series of reviews of the pharmacotherapy of SAnD has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Blanco-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanco 2002</LINK>; 
<LINK REF="REF-Blanco-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanco 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtiss-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtiss 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Menezes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Menezes 2011</LINK>). These reviews have been useful in summarising the existing research, pointing to methodological flaws, and outlining areas for future research. A number of systematic reviews also exist (<LINK REF="REF-Blanco-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanco 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedoroff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedoroff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linden 2000</LINK>), and these have provided useful lessons for both clinicians and researchers. Further reviews in this area, from Cochrane or elsewhere, need to adhere to guidelines for the systematic identification of trials, investigation of sources of heterogeneity, measurement of methodological quality, and estimation of the effects of intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors updated the systematic review of RCTs of the pharmacotherapy of SAnD, following Cochrane guidelines and software (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>

<B>Reduction in SAnD symptoms</B>: we assessed symptom severity and, where available, symptom cluster response, using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), a validated, commonly used, and psychometrically sound instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Liebowitz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebowitz 1987</LINK>). The LSAS is a 24-item scale that provides separate scores for fear and avoidance in social and performance situations, with higher scores representing increased social anxiety. The LSAS contains three total scores: total fear score (0 to 72), total avoidance score (0 to 72), and total overall score (0 to 144). Suggested interpretations are that total scores of 55 to 65 indicate moderate social phobia; 65 to 80, marked social phobia; 80 to 95, severe social phobia; and greater than 95, very severe social phobia.</LI>

<B>Reduction in depressive symptoms</B>: we determined comorbid depressive symptoms using standardised scales such as the Hamilton Depression scale (HAM-D) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>) or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>), the Montgomery&#8211;Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or similar. The Hamilton Depression scale (HAM-D) is a multiple item questionnaire with 17 to 29 items (depending on the version). Patients are rated on a 3 or 5 point scale. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal and a score of 20 or higher moderate, severe, or very severe. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. A score of 0&#8211;9 indicates minimal depression, 10&#8211;18 mild depression, 19&#8211;29 moderate depression and 30&#8211;63 severe depression. The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. A higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Usual cutoff points are 0 to 6 &#8211; normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19 &#8211; mild depression; 20 to 34 &#8211; moderate depression; and &gt; 34 &#8211; severe depression.</LI>

The patient rates the extent to which his or her 1) work, 2) social life or leisure activities, and 3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10-point visual analogue scale.

<P>We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We considered the following six domains.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation: did investigators use a random number table or a computerised random number generator?</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: was the medication sequentially numbered, sealed, and placed in opaque envelopes?</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors for each main outcome or class of outcomes: was knowledge of the allocated treatment or assessment adequately prevented during the study?</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data for each main outcome or class of outcomes: were missing or excluded outcome data adequately addressed?</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: were the reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? We could only make such a judgement based on the availability of the protocol.</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI>
</OL>
<P>We extracted relevant information from each study report, where provided. We made a judgement on the risk of bias for each domain within and across studies, based on the following three categories: 'low' risk of bias, 'unclear' risk of bias, and 'high' risk of bias. Two independent review authors (TW and JI) assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We discussed any disagreements with a third review author (DS). Where necessary, we contacted the authors of the studies for further information. We present all risk of bias data graphically and describe them in the text.</P>

<P>We calculated the risk ratio (RR) of response to treatment for the dichotomous outcomes of interest. We used RR instead of odds ratio (OR), as ORs are more difficult to interpret. ORs also tend to overestimate the size of the treatment effect relative to RRs, especially when the occurrence of the outcome of interest is common (as anticipated in this review, with an expected response greater than 20%) (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>In cluster-randomised trials, groups of individuals are randomised to different interventions rather than individuals themselves. Analysing treatment response in cluster-randomised trials without taking these groupings into account is potentially problematic, as participants within any one cluster often tend to respond in a similar manner, and thus analyses cannot assume that participants' data are independent of the rest of the cluster. Cluster-randomised trials also face additional risk of bias issues including recruitment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters, and non-comparability with trials randomising individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). No cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. To prevent unit of analysis errors in future updates of this review, we plan to divide the effective sample size of each comparison group in trials that do not adjust for clustering by the design effect metric (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For these analyses the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) that is incorporated within the design effect will be set equivalent to the median ICC from published cluster-randomised pharmacotherapy RCTs for anxiety disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We only included cross-over trials in the calculation of summary statistics when it was possible to extract medication and placebo/comparator data from the first treatment period or when the inclusion of these data from both treatment periods was justified by a washout period of sufficient duration that minimised the risk of carry-over effects. In the latter case, we included data from both periods only when it was possible to determine the correlation between participants' responses to the interventions in the different phases (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). A washout period of at least two weeks was necessary in the case of trials assessing the efficacy of agents with extended half-lives, such as the SSRI fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Gury-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gury 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>A number of the trials included in this review compared more than two intervention groups or multiple doses of the same medication against placebo. Including data from the same placebo group for these studies repeatedly in the same comparison would result in a unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). To prevent these errors for trials comparing multiple dosages of the same agent to placebo, we averaged the mean and standard deviation of the outcome of interest across dosage groups. We included outcome data from multiple treatment arms in the same comparison if the agents tested were from different medication classes. We turned off the subtotals of the outcome if the placebo group appeared twice in the analysis to accommodate for the second medication. In the case of trials testing multiple agents from the same classes, and in calculating the total effect across all medication classes, we restricted data from multi-arm RCTs to the agent that was least represented in the database.</P>
<P>We will circumvent unit-of-analysis bias resulting from the simultaneous comparison of multiple arms from the same trial in future updates of this review by means of a multiple-treatments meta-analysis (MTM) (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2002</LINK>). An MTM allows the assessment of treatment efficacy through the combination of both direct and indirect comparisons of all interventions on a specific outcome. We can subsequently assess potential unit-of-analysis bias in a sensitivity analysis in which we compare the results obtained with those from a meta-analysis restricted to data from direct comparisons of interventions.</P>

<P>All analyses of dichotomous data were intention-to-treat (ITT). We only included data from trials providing information on the original group size (prior to dropouts) in the analyses of treatment efficacy. We gave preference within studies to the inclusion of summary statistics for continuous outcome measures derived from mixed-effects models, followed by last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) summary statistics (in that order).

If the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test had a P value of less than 0.10, we interpreted it as evidence of heterogeneity, given the low power of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test when the number of trials is small (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). We also used the Deeks' stratified test of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-200" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 200</LINK>), as implemented in RevMan 5, to assess differences by means of the Q<SUB>b</SUB> metric in treatment response between subgroups, by subtracting the sum of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for the subgroups from the total Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for those subgroups.</P>

<P>Funnel plots provide a graphic illustration of the effect estimates of an intervention from individual studies against some measure of the precision of that estimate. We visually inspected publication bias from the funnel plot for treatment efficacy, with the consideration of confounding selection bias, poor methodological quality, true heterogeneity, artefact, and chance. We also calculated Eggers' regression tests as a more objective quantitative measure of funnel plot asymmetry using the Dersimonian and Laird estimator of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Given that both tests are dependent on having 10 trials per outcome, we could only calculate this for SSRIs. <LINK REF="REF-Irwig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwig 1998</LINK> and others have voiced concerns that the statistical phenomenon increasing the likelihood of falsely detecting publication bias when applying the Egger test to odds ratio effect estimates may extend to risk ratio effect estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>). Accordingly, we generated contour enhanced funnel plots, which explicitly illustrate the relationship between missing studies and the statistical significance of study findings at various statistical thresholds (e.g. alpha = 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01) (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2008</LINK>).

<P>We obtained binary and continuous treatment effects from a random-effects model. Random-effects analytic models include both within-study sampling error and between-study variation in determining the precision of the confidence interval around the overall effect size, whereas fixed-effect modelling approaches take only within-study variation into account. In recognition of the possibility of differential effects for different types of medication, such as the SSRIs and the MAOIs, we stratified all of the comparisons by medication class.

<P>Sensitivity analyses determine the robustness of the review authors' conclusion to methodological assumptions made in conducting the meta-analysis. We planned to compare the effect of assessing interventions in terms of clinical treatment response versus non-response in light of evidence that treatment response may result in less consistent outcome statistics than non-response (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>).

<P>In addition, we performed a 'worst case/best case' analysis to determine whether the the coding of participants who were lost to follow-up influenced the findings of treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). In this analysis, we recorded all the missing data for the treatment group as responders in the worst case scenario, whereas in the best case, we coded all missing data for the control group as responders.

<P>Twenty-three trials assessed the primary efficacy outcome &#8211; number of participants with SAnD who responded to treatment &#8211; using the Clinical Global Impression &#8211; Global Improvement (CGI&#8211;I) Scale, whilst 27 other trials assessed this outcome as a secondary measure using the same scale. Forty-two trials used the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) to assess the reduction of SAnD symptoms, while eight used the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S). The most common measures used to assess depression were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; k = 2), the the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D; k = 12), and the Montgomery&#8211;Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (k = 10). Thirty trials assessed functional disability using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Post-treatment follow-up assessments ranged from two weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Tauscher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tauscher 2010</LINK> to 15 months in <LINK REF="STD-Oosterbaan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oosterbaan 2001</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">20. Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>There is evidence of possible funnel plot asymmetry providing data on response to short-term medication treatment, both for the SSRIs and all medications combined. Inspection of the contour enhanced funnel plots for the SSRIs (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and all of the trials (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) suggests that this asymmetry is due to publication bias, as trials with less precise treatment response outcomes are more likely than their higher precision counterparts to be missing from regions of the plot representing statistically non-significant treatment effects. Egger regression tests quantitatively confirmed this visual impression, providing evidence of possible publication bias for all of the medication trials (t = 2.8226, df = 49, P = 0.0069) and for the SSRIs (t = 2.6426, df = 22, P = 0.015). Nevertheless, trim and fill imputation of missing effect estimates from small studies with negative results continue to provide support for the efficacy of both the SSRIs (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.71) and all medications (RR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.66) in treating SAnD.

<P>We found evidence of an overall benefit of medication for treating SAnD in this review. Most evidence was for the SSRIs (i.e. paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and citalopram) and was very low in quality. Similarly, we found low-quality evidence of efficacy for the MAOI phenelzine, the RIMAs brofaromine and moclobemide, and the benzodiazepines clonazepam and bromazepam, with moderate-quality evidence of efficacy observed for the anticonvulsant/GABAs gabapentin and pregabalin. Conversely, there was no evidence in this review of a global clinical response to treatment for certain medication classes, including the 5HT1A partial agonists, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, the antipsychotic olanzapine, the beta-blockers, the NARIs, the NaSSAs, or the SNRI venlafaxine, as well as for the experimental agents GW876008 and NK1 receptor antagonist GR205171.</P>
<P>This review also found evidence for an effect of the SSRIs in preventing relapse. Individuals diagnosed with SAnD who were treated with either SSRIs or the SNRI venlafaxine were more likely to withdraw from treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. Nevertheless, the absolute proportion of individuals dropping out from treatment with these medications due to adverse events over the short term (14 weeks or less) was low (12% for SSRIs and 16% for venlafaxine). There was little evidence that any of the SSRI agents were less tolerable than any other (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 23%), as confirmed by a post hoc comparisons of dropout rates due to adverse events by agent (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 31.82, df = 24, P = 0.13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 25%). The MAOIs and benzodiazepines appeared to be relatively well tolerated and also showed the largest treatment response (see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found sufficient evidence of efficacy for reducing depression symptoms only observed for the SSRIs and RIMAs. Nevertheless, the possibility that response to treatment with these agents is entirely accounted for by their anti-depressant effect is countered by evidence (albeit of very low quality) in this review that the SSRIs and RIMAs are effective in reducing SAnD symptoms (in addition to the MAOIs, the benzodiazepines, the SNRI venlafaxine, the antipsychotic olanzapine, and the NaSSA mirtazapine). Moreover, although trials of the MAOIs, SARIs, and benzodiazepines demonstrated evidence of efficacy of these agents in improving functioning in some domains, the SSRIs were the only medications showing a treatment effect on all three subscales (i.e. work, social, and family) of the SDS. It was on the basis of evidence such as this that the US FDA approved the SSRIs paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine for treating SAnD &#8211; the only agents that currently enjoy this status (<LINK REF="REF-Blanco-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanco 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found a response to long-term treatment (20 to 24 weeks) with medication for the SSRIs (based on low-quality evidence), the MAOIs (based on very low-quality evidence), and for the RIMAs (based on moderate-quality evidence). A similar proportion of participants withdrew due to treatment-emergent side effects from the paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and placebo groups after long-term treatment. Readers should exercise great caution in any inferences about the experimental agents (GW876008, the NK1 antagonist GR20517 and LY686017), more trials with each of these agents in the future may allow better comparison of classes of medication.</P>
<P>For the subgroup outcomes, there was evidence that treatment response was influenced by whether RCTs took place at single or multiple centres. The size of the effect observed was also dependent on participant characteristics, with a smaller response to treatment observed in studies that restricted inclusion to participants diagnosed with generalised SAnD. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that treatment response across all medication classes varied as a function of whether trials were funded by industry or included participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder. There is also reason to believe that the effect sizes reported across all medication classes, as well as for the SSRIs, may be inflated, based on properties of the data that are consistent with publication bias. Nevertheless, the effects of medication in general and the SSRIs in particular on treatment response persist even after adjustments to account for the effect of the increased likelihood of publishing small trials if they report a positive effect of medication.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Reviews of the body of evidence for pharmacotherapy of SAnD have designated SSRIs as first-line medication agents for treating SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). The current review supports the efficacy of SSRIs for short-term treatment of SAnD. Similarly, maintenance studies demonstrate some further consolidation of clinical response to SSRIs over time.</P>
<P>Importantly, although there was evidence for treatment withdrawal owing to drug-related adverse events in the SNRI and SSRI trials, dropout rates were comparable between these medication classes. This contradicts findings in a meta-analysis of the depression literature, which found venlafaxine to be more efficacious than SSRIs in increasing remission rates, but with a higher rate of withdrawal owing to treatment-related adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Nemeroff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemeroff 2008</LINK>). Given the frequent prescription of beta-blockers for performance anxiety, the relative lack of empirical support for this intervention is surprising. We also found evidence of heterogeneity for the MAOIs, the RIMAs, and the SSRIs when investigating the efficacy of treatment in participants with SAnD. These differences may be partly accounted for by methodological and clinical variance but may also reflect real differences in efficacy across different medications. None of the four trials of the MAOI phenelzine provide information on the number of participants who withdrew from treatment as a result of drug-related adverse events, against which to weigh the observed evidence for a response to treatment with this agent. There has been no investigation into the efficacy of other medication classes that may be considered for treating SAnD, such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).</P>
<P>Although the SSRI trials under review used medication doses that are consistent with those advised in recent expert consensus recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>), there are few rigorous dose-finding studies using fixed-dose comparisons. The paroxetine database suggests that the dose-response curve of SSRIs is relatively flat in SAnD, but that some participants may require higher doses (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>). Most SSRI studies lasted at least 12 weeks. The finding from the paroxetine database that a significant proportion of non-responders at week 8 become responders by week 12 suggests that patients in clinical practice should be treated for a minimum period of 12 weeks before modifying treatment regimens due to medication non-response (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002c</LINK>). Similarly, the maintenance studies demonstrate some further consolidation of clinical response over time in SAnD.</P>
<P>The negative 14-week trial of fluoxetine raises the question of whether all SSRIs are equally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Kobak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobak 2002</LINK>). The fluoxetine study included in this review had a relatively high placebo response rate and was not consistent with several early open-label reports of the value of this medication in SAnD. Further work is needed to understand the differences in placebo response across the database of SAnD studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oosterbaan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oosterbaan 1997</LINK>). In a study by <LINK REF="STD-Katschnig-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Katschnig 1997</LINK>, for example, placebo response was higher in participants without avoidant personality disorder, in participants with a short duration of illness, and in participants with less severe illness. <LINK REF="REF-Kobak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobak 2002</LINK> found that placebo-responders had an earlier response than medication responders and that lower severity of illness was associated with increased placebo response. These findings were similar to a recent report on two meta-analyses where bias (i.e. reporting bias) appeared to have led to significant increases in the number of positive findings in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Roest-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roest 2015</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes of this review may be generalisable to a diverse range of settings. Studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Japan, South Africa, and Iran, in both outpatient and inpatient settings (mainly outpatient settings). The interventions targeted both men and women across a wide age range. Differences in treatment delivery, as well as the background and training of study investigators and outcome assessors, increases the likelihood that the findings of this review are applicable to a range of countries in different income brackets. However, careful consideration should be given to the specific contexts in which the trials took place, given the lack of evidence on the availability and cost-effectiveness of individual medications. The findings of this review will not apply equally to the full range of individuals presenting at clinics for the treatment of SAnD. RCTs included in this review were also restricted to those assessing the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for SAnD in adults. The finding in this review that clinicians should consider medication, and in particular the SSRIs, for treating SAnD, may not apply to children. Readers are referred in this regard to another Cochrane Review on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Ipser-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ipser 2009a</LINK>). Most published trials of pharmacotherapy for SAnD exclude individuals with concurrent psychopathology, including substance use disorders, which are highly comorbid with SAnD. Although the limited RCT database suggests that medication may be equally effective in people with SAnD who are dependent on alcohol (<LINK REF="STD-Book-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Book 2008</LINK>), and certain forms of comorbidity may actually be prognostic of greater treatment response (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2002a</LINK>), firm evidence supporting conclusions regarding whether medication is indicated for these populations is currently lacking.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-27 12:21:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve of the included RCTs possessed a high risk of bias related to at least one aspect of study design, with the most commonly observed weaknesses having to do with attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Allgulander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allgulander 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Book-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Book 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katzelnick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Katzelnick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liebowitz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Liebowitz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moghadam-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Moghadam 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordahl-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Nordahl 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameringen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameringen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). Lack of blinding for outcome assessors may also have influenced the detection of treatment effects (<LINK REF="STD-Blomhoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blomhoff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moghadam-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Moghadam 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameringen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameringen 2007</LINK>). There was also evidence for selective reporting bias in <LINK REF="STD-Book-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Book 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nordahl-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Nordahl 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tauscher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tauscher 2010</LINK>. Even though the SSRIs were the best-represented medication class, with 24 of the 51 RCTs contributing to the outcome of clinical response, most of these trials scored unclear for random sequence generation as well as for allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Judgements of response to treatment with the SSRIs were based on evidence rated as being of very low quality. Therefore, we are very uncertain about the estimate (see <LINK REF="SOF-13" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 13</LINK>). The RIMAs, MAOIs, and benzodiazepines were based on evidence rated as being of low quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>), indicating that additional data from further studies may change the size of the treatment effect estimate for these medication classes, as well as our confidence in that estimate of effect. The anticonvulsants/GABAs, on the other hand, were based on evidence rated as being of moderate quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-12" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 12</LINK>). Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect for these medication classes. The most common reasons for downgrading studies were imprecise effect estimates, low response rates, small sample size, a rating of high or unclear bias for study design (based on 50% attrition rates across groups, detection, and selective reporting bias), and inconsistency between studies (indicated by heterogeneity between the medication and placebo group).</P>
<P>Variability in the number of sites contributing data reported in included studies could also have biased the results of the review. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the size of treatment effect estimates are larger in single-centre than multicentre trials, even after adjusting for sample size and various bias risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2011</LINK>). It is notable that approximately a third of the trials providing data on treatment response for this review were in single centres. Moreover, those trials were over-represented amongst RCTs of SSRIs and in studies reporting the largest treatment effects, including more than half of the MAOI trials and both benzodiazepine RCTs. Additionally, there was a smaller treatment response in RCTs that explicitly described limiting study inclusion to people diagnosed with generalised SAnD. This finding is in agreement with the perception that the generalised SAnD subtype is more difficult to treat. It may once again have resulted in a positive bias for the MAOI, RIMA, and benzodiazepine studies in particular, given that with the exception of a single trial of phenelzine (<LINK REF="STD-Heimberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Heimberg 1998</LINK>), all of the included RCTs for these medication classes failed to specify that they restricted inclusion to the generalised subtype.</P>
<P>The size of the response to acute treatment with any medication and specifically with the SSRIs may be exaggerated, as possible funnel plot asymmetry for this outcome suggests (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Egger regression tests quantitatively confirmed the presence of small sample bias. Although small sample bias may arise from other factors besides publication bias, the absence of smaller studies with statistically non-significant effects of treatment, as illustrated by contour-enhanced funnel plots (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), does suggest that investigators are not publishing smaller studies that fail to detect treatment effects.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-27 12:21:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted an extensive search for studies meeting rigorous inclusion criteria and repeatedly attempted to obtain missing data from the trial investigators. Nevertheless, there were insufficient data available to assess the extent to which selective publication may have introduced bias in the findings for medication classes besides the SSRIs. Furthermore, the post hoc addition of comparisons of the efficacy of 5HT partial agonists, anticonvulsants with or without GABAs, antipsychotics, NARIs, NaSSAs, and SARIs may have also introduced bias as a result of the small number of eligible RCTs for these medication classes (1 to 3 studies).</P>
<P>The reliance on the LSAS, while considered the gold standard for measurement of SAnD symptom severity in clinical trials, represents another potential source of bias. Treatment outcomes not assessed by standardised scales such as the LSAS also deserve more attention. For example, physiological symptoms are often a source of concern for people (symptoms such as excessive sweating may for example lead to a request for surgery), and the LSAS does not specifically record these (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis also has inherent problems (<LINK REF="REF-Bailar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailar 1999</LINK>); although indirect comparison of competing interventions usually agree with direct ones (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2003</LINK>), meta-analysis is by no means a substitute for direct clinical research. Furthermore, the context of general clinical practice differs from RCTs in specialised centres in many respects, not the least being the need to treat more complex participants. In particular, conclusions about the relative efficacy of different agents from trials with different participants require confirmation in head-to-head comparisons. An early head-to-head study of clomipramine versus diazepam suggested superiority of clomipramine, but there were relatively few participants with social phobia (<LINK REF="STD-Allsopp-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Allsopp 1984</LINK>). The only head-to-head comparison of an SSRI versus moclobemide did not include a placebo control but did suggest equal efficacy and tolerability, lending caution to the findings of the current review (<LINK REF="STD-Atmaca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Atmaca 2002</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The finding in this review of moderate to substantial variability in the response of participants with SAnD to pharmacotherapy is likely to reflect real differences in efficacy across different medication and differences brought on by trial methodology and the clinical characteristics of patients. In comparing medication classes in terms of beneficial and adverse responses to medication, the data included in this review are consistent with findings from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses in identifying the SSRIs as first line agents for the treatment of SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Ballenger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballenger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanco-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanco 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linden 2000</LINK>). The finding of efficacy for the SSRIs reported in this review is based on a considerably larger database of randomised controlled trials than in previous reviews and reports. 
</P>
<P>This review classified medications based on their putative mechanisms of action (taken from CCMD antidepressant classification map) (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2015</LINK>), and they do not necessarily map onto the drug classification schemes employed in other reviews. Nevertheless, we are able to confirm the efficacy of the SSRIs, SNRIs, the RIMAs, and the anticonvulsants/GABAs.</P>
<P>MAOIs, in the form of phenelzine, as well as certain benzodiazepines, are also effective in SAnD, but in view of concerns about ease of administration (e.g. MAOIs require dietary and medication restrictions) and side effects (risk of abuse with benzodiazepines seems to be highest in individuals with a history of substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Licata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Licata 2008</LINK>)), it does not seem reasonable to view these drugs as second-line agents.</P>

<P>Medication can be effective for the treatment of SAnD, with higher rates of treatment response compared to placebo, as well as reductions in core SAnD symptoms and associated disability. Most evidence of efficacy in this review was for the SSRIs. Although there was evidence that treatment with SSRIs was less tolerable than placebo, the absolute proportions of participants withdrawing due to drug-related adverse events after treatment with these agents were small (&lt; 17%). Moreover, the SSRIs were the only medication class that demonstrated consistent evidence of reductions in functional disability across a number of domains. The possible influence of publication bias on the validity of conclusions regarding the efficacy overall, and the SSRIs in particular, in treating SAnD, as well as the potential risk of bias for this outcome, needs to be acknowledged. This review also found preliminary evidence to support the use of the anticonvulsants/GABAs in treating SAnD. Readers should exercise great caution in making any inferences about the experimental agents GW876008 and NK1 receptor antagonist GR205171; more trials with each of these agents in the future may allow better comparison of classes of medication.</P>
<P>Treatment efficacy of medication was significantly larger in trials conducted at single centres than multiple centres, as well as when administered to participants described as being diagnosed with generalised SAnD. The findings that both RIMAs and benzodiazepines were efficacious and tolerable in treating SAnD therefore needs to be interpreted in light of the observation that none of the included trials for these medications reported restricting inclusion to the generalised SAnD subtype. Moreover, the RIMAs are not available in clinical practice, while findings from the small number of trials of benzodiazepines must be weighed against concerns regarding their adverse effects and their lack efficacy for common comorbid conditions that occur with SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Licata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Licata 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials took place in a diverse range of settings and with heterogenous samples and should therefore currently be considered in a broad spectrum of SAnD participants. Nevertheless, we recognise that certain forms of the disorder, such as those consisting of 'pure' public speaking fears, were not well represented in this review. We observed continued response to medication in trials extending beyond 12 weeks in duration, supporting the consensus that medication responders should continue to be treated over the long term. Although beta-blockers are often recommended for the treatment of performance anxiety, there was insufficient evidence in this review to support the use of this medication class for people without the generalised type of SAnD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-26 15:17:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Differences in the efficacy of different medications deserve more attention; there are few studies directly comparing modern agents with one another. In addition, there is a paucity of RCTs evaluating the efficacy of medications for treating SAnD in people with comorbid disorders, including substance use disorders, and in people in general psychiatric and medical settings. Studies of these populations could address the question of whether early and robust pharmacotherapy of SAnD can prevent subsequent morbidity and comorbidity. Further attention should also be paid to people who fall on a putative SAnD spectrum of disorders, including people with performance anxiety. Finally, commonly used symptom outcomes in SAnD have limitations, with more refined measures of response to treatment warranting further investigation. This would help inform the concept of remission in SAnD.</P>
<P>Additional work is also needed to determine the best approach to people who fail to respond to pharmacotherapy; there are relatively few studies of treatment augmentation (<LINK REF="REF-Ipser-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ipser 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Ameringen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Ameringen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aarre-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarre 2003</LINK>) or pharmacotherapy switching (<LINK REF="REF-Kelsey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelsey 1995</LINK>). The current review also does not directly address the question of whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy has a larger effect size in SAnD (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1997</LINK>). In clinical practice, clinicians often use exposure instructions (<LINK REF="STD-Gelernter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gelernter 1991</LINK>), while theoretically, modern understanding of SAnD as involving psychobiological dysfunctions would indicate that it is unnecessary to institute false dichotomies between brain and mind, and that both kinds of intervention might be useful (<LINK REF="REF-Furmark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furmark 2002</LINK>). Therefore, another research priority revolves around the combined use of pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy and when and if these treatments should be combined or sequenced.</P>

The laboratory communicated serum levels outside the targeted range to the psychiatrist, and medications were added.

Treating clinicians (M.B.S., C.D.L.K., and R.A.C.) followed a protocol that mandated 10-mg weekly increments to a maximum of 50 mg/day. If subjects experienced side effects, a once-only dosage reduction of 10 mg/day was permitted, with the option of reinstituting the prior dose if clinically indicated 1 week later. Only one such dosage adjustment was allowed per patient. Patients who could not tolerate a minimum of 20 mg/day were withdrawn from the study. Treatment lasted for a total of 11 weeks ... Patients were then randomized to either continue paroxetine with no change in dose or to taper and then discontinue paroxetine with placebo substitution for a total of 12 weeks. Regardless of the starting dose, the rate of taper consisted of 1 week at 20 mg and then discontinuation.

<P>A larger proportion of participants discontinued the study in the atenolol (4/25; 16%) group compared to the placebo group (1/21; 5%), though a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test reported that the difference in dropout proportions across all 3 treatment arms was not significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>(2, N = 71) = 2.19, P &gt; 0.05). No information was provided regarding the reasons for treatment withdrawal nor was there information reported on if the 2 groups differed by sample characteristics at week 12. Quote: "Nine patients (12.1%) dropped out during the course of the 12-week treatment; 5 from flooding, 3 from atenolol, and 1 from placebo. In addition, 1 patient was removed from atenolol treatment because of orthostatic hypotension. Thus, there were 62 patients who completed the study".

<P>Similar proportions of participants withdrew from sertraline (31/135; 23%) and placebo groups (15/69; 22%). Similar reasons for withdrawal were found across the 2 groups, although more participants withdrew in the sertraline group because of adverse events compare to those participants in the placebo groups. The 2 groups did not differ by sample characteristics at baseline. Quote: "There were no statistically significant differences between groups in demographic characteristics or mean baseline rating scale scores ... In the sertraline group, 104 (77%) of 135 patients completed the 20-week trial. In the placebo group, 54 (78%) of 69 patients completed the trial. The reasons for patient discontinuation in the sertraline and placebo groups, respectively, were adverse events (N=16 versus N=1), lack of efficacy (N=4 versus N=4), withdrew consent (N=4 versus N=7), lost to follow-up (N=3 versus N=1), protocol violation (N=1 versus N=0) and administrative reasons (N=3 versus N=2)". Overall 22% of the participants dropped out of the study.

No information was provided on whether participants differed in terms of characteristics by group at week 12, however. Nevertheless, the total proportion of dropouts (10%) is relatively low, suggesting that dropout rates may not have biased the outcomes.

Seventeen patients in the moclobemide group and 20 patients in the phenelzine group entered phase III ... There were no significant differences between the three treatment groups regarding demographic characteristics or diagnostic features. In phase I, during the first week, two patients refused to continue the study and were replaced. During weeks 4 to 8, four patients left the study three from the placebo group (for lack of efficacy) and one from the phenelzine group (for side-effects - dizziness, loss of libido, and headache).

Quote: "Twenty-four subjects were screened and 19 subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment. Reasons for screen failure included voluntary withdrawal after reading the informed consent (n=3), a primary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (n=1), and not meeting criteria for social anxiety disorder (n=1). Among those who were enrolled, one subject dropped out immediately after baseline for unrelated medical reasons, presenting a protocol violation, and was therefore replaced to provide 18 appropriately enrolled subjects as per the study design. Two subjects dropped out following the baseline visit due to early side effects from LEV (muscle spasms and pain, n=1; severe headache, n=1) and failed to return for efficacy ratings, thus leaving 16 subjects (n=9 LEV, n=7 PBO) available for the ITT LOCF analysis. Fourteen subjects (n=7 each LEV and PBO) completed the 7-week treatment period ... No between treatment differences were observed in the baseline demographic characteristics". Overall 22% of the participants dropped out of the study.

The high percentage of dropouts in the placebo group due to lack of efficacy, however, raises the question of whether blinding of participants was broken. Quote: "It must be emphasized that this study did not include a comparison of paroxetine CR and paroxetine IR. Moreover, the dose ranges studied in the current study were not identical to the dose ranges employed in prior studies, hence conclusions regarding their relative tolerability and efficacy profiles cannot be drawn from these trials ... A greater proportion of patients in the placebo group withdrew from the study prematurely due to lack of efficacy (2.2% in the paroxetine CR group and 15.8% in the placebo group)".</P>

<P>Although the authors caution against "the possibility of publication bias", they conclude that drugs, in particular SSRIs, appear effective. I don't agree. The trials were of very poor quality, and the effect decreased so dramatically with the number of patients in the trial that any meta-analysis of these data would be grossly unreliable. The authors nonetheless meta-analysed their data and reported a relative risk of non-response of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.73) on the Global Impression Scale. But they also showed in a figure that the largest trials found an effect close to zero.</P>
<P>Another problem is that all the scales appear to have been rated by the clinicians and not the patients, which is known to create a large bias in trials of SSRIs. For depression trials, the standardised mean difference in trials that had both psychiatrists and patients as observers was around 0.25 when the psychiatrists evaluated the effect but only 0.05 when the patients were their own judges (1).</P>
<P>The review also reported an effect in relapse prevention studies, but such trials are highly unreliable because abstinence symptoms are introduced in the placebo group when the patients come off their drug cold turkey (1). An additional problem is that many trials use the last observation carried forward, which would be expected to bias these trials further since the patients' abstinence symptoms can be depression and anxiety, causing them to drop out, against which the effect of the active drug is judged. This is an unfair comparison.</P>
<P>In my opinion, neither SSRIs, nor benzodiazepines should be used for social phobia. Psychotherapy works and the patients need to learn how to cope with their anxiety rather than being emotionally numbed by drugs that many have difficulty stopping again, as they become dependent on them (1).</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:04:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prof. Gøtzsche recently commented on our Cochrane review of pharmacotherapy for social phobia, published in 2006. While we have responded to his comments below, we would like to note that the review in question is currently in the process of being updated to conform to the most recent Cochrane standards regarding assessment of trial quality using the risk of bias tool and GRADE quality ratings.</P>
<P>It is true that the quality of the reporting of some of the included studies was poor, as assessed using the CCMD Quality of Research Scale. This was particularly apparent amongst the earlier and smaller studies, the same studies that contributed towards evidence for possible publication bias on the CGI-I. It should be noted, however, that the weight assigned to data from individual studies in deriving the overall treatment effect estimate for CGI-I non-response is proportional to the size of their samples. As a result, the less reliable effect estimates from smaller studies have a relatively minor influence on the overall treatment effect. This can be appreciated when one considers that removing the half of the 26 studies contributing towards this outcome with the smallest sample sizes has minimal effect on the total effect estimate (Risk Ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.78). It should also be noted that the majority of the remaining trials (9/13), each of which contain at least 40 participants in each treatment arm, compared the efficacy of SSRIs to placebo. These findings suggest that evidence for the efficacy of medication in treating social anxiety disorder is relatively robust.</P>
<P>The peer-reviewed literature suggests that self-rated and clinician rated SAD symptom severity measures are highly concordant (1), and that these measures might perhaps best be thought of as providing different kinds of data with respect to treatment response, at least within the depression literature (2). Alluding to lower outcome effect estimates as indicative of less susceptibility to bias presumes a level of knowledge about the true efficacy of medication in treating psychiatric disorders that we do not currently possess. Indeed, one of the primary motivations for conducting our review in the first place was to arrive at a best estimate of the effect of medication in treating SAD, using data from trials that are optimally designed to be informative with respect to their efficacy. Preference was given to clinician-rated instruments in our review, as they have been more consistently employed across treatment studies, thereby facilitating meta-analytic synthesis of data provided by these studies.</P>
<P>Three of the four relapse prevention trials included in the analysis referred to by Prof. Gøtzsche employed gradual step-wise down-titration of doses to minimise the possibility of abstinence symptoms. For instance, Connor et al. (1998) describe employing "a fixed-dose taper of 0.25 mg every 2 weeks" of clonazepam, so that it took between 6 and 18 weeks to take participants completely off medication. In the single study where participants were abruptly discontinued from sertraline (Walker et al. 2000), the authors report that only "two patients (8%) in the Placebo-Switch group discontinued in the 2 weeks following abrupt discontinuation of sertraline because of adverse events that may have been attributable to discontinuation reactions". While we do not agree that relapse prevention studies are highly unreliable, it is certainly important that withdrawal effects be considered and addressed.</P>
<P>The evidence indicates that certain forms of psychotherapy are effective in social anxiety disorder, although they arguably involve a good deal more than learning to cope. We are not aware of a great deal of evidence that medications lead to emotional numbing in social anxiety disorder. While benzodiazepines can certainly be associated with withdrawal effects, the relapse prevention studies in SAnD indicate relatively few adverse events with SSRI withdrawal. We would note that in settings such as our own, it was estimated by the World Health Organization that in 2011 there was one psychologist for roughly 300 000 people (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/atlas)">http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/atlas)</A> and that even in well-resourced developed nations, individuals with SAnD face barriers in accessing or engaging with psychotherapy.</P>
