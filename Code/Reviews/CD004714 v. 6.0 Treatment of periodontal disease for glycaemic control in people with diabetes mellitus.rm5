Keeping blood sugar levels under control is a key issue for people with diabetes, and some clinical research suggests a relationship exists between gum disease treatment and glycaemic control. As a result, it is important to discover if gum disease treatment does improve glycaemic control to encourage better use of clinical resources.</P><P>There is a broad range of gum disease treatments available for treating patients with diabetes. This review considered two types.</P><P>1. Does gum disease treatment improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes?<BR/>2. Does one type of gum disease treatment have a bigger effect than another in improving blood sugar control?</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>This review of existing clinical trials was carried out by authors working with the Cochrane Oral Health Group and updates the previous version published in 2010. The evidence is current up to 31 December 2014.</P><P>In this review there are 35 trials (including 2565 participants), published between 1997 and 2014, where people randomly received a type of gum disease treatment (including scaling and root planing (SRP) and SRP combined with other types of treatment), or usual care/no active treatment.</P><P>The trials included in this review used SRP with, or without, an additional treatment. Additional treatments included instructions for cleaning teeth properly (known as oral hygiene instruction (OHI)), and other gum treatments (for example, antimicrobials, which are used to treat infections).</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>We found 35 trials that were suitable for inclusion in this review. Thirty-four of those studies provided results that could be included in at least one of the two comparisons.</P><P>1. The evidence from 14 trials (1499 participants) showed that SRP reduces blood sugar levels in diabetic patients by 0.29% up to 4 months after receiving care when compared with usual care/no active treatment. After 6 months, there was no evidence that this reduction was sustained.</P><P>2. The evidence from 21 trials (920 participants) investigating different types of gum disease treatments failed to show that one treatment was better than another.</P><P>There were not enough studies measuring side effects to be able to show if gum disease treatments cause any harm.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Currently there is low quality evidence to support using scaling and root planing for controlling blood sugar levels up to 4 months after receiving treatment. Ongoing gum disease treatment is advised to maintain improvements in blood sugar levels.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:08:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-05 19:12:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Glycaemic control is a key issue in the care of people with diabetes mellitus (DM).

ZETOC (1993 to 31 December 2014) and Web of Knowledge (1990 to 31 December 2014) were searched for conference proceedings. Additionally, two periodontology journals were handsearched for completeness, <I>Annals of Periodontology</I> (1996 to 2003) and <I>Periodontology 2000</I> (1993 to 2003). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-05 10:18:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with type 1 or type 2 DM (T1DM/T2DM) with a diagnosis of periodontitis. Interventions included periodontal treatments such as mechanical debridement, surgical treatment and antimicrobial therapy. Two broad comparisons were proposed:</P><P>1. periodontal therapy versus no active intervention/usual care;<BR/>2. periodontal therapy versus alternative periodontal therapy.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-05 10:18:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>For this review update, at least two review authors independently examined the titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, selected the included trials, extracted data from included trials and assessed included trials for risk of bias.</P><P>Our primary outcome was blood glucose levels measured as glycated (glycosylated) haemoglobin assay (HbA1c).</P><P>Our secondary outcomes included adverse effects, periodontal indices (bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and probing pocket depth (PPD)), cost implications and diabetic complications.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:08:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 35 studies (including seven from the previous version of the review), which included 2565 participants in total. All studies used a parallel RCT design, and 33 studies (94%) only targeted T2DM patients. There was variation between studies with regards to included age groups (ages 18 to 80), duration of follow-up (3 to 12 months), use of antidiabetic therapy, and included participants' baseline HbA1c levels (from 5.5% to 13.1%).</P><P>We assessed 29 studies (83%) as being at high risk of bias, two studies (6%) as being at low risk of bias, and four studies (11%) as unclear. Thirty-four of the studies provided data suitable for analysis under one or both of the two comparisons.</P><P>Comparison 1: low quality evidence from 14 studies (1499 participants) comparing periodontal therapy with no active intervention/usual care demonstrated that mean HbA1c was 0.29% lower (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48% to 0.10% lower) 3 to 4 months post-treatment, and 0.02% lower after 6 months (five studies, 826 participants; 95% CI 0.20% lower to 0.16% higher).</P><P>Comparison 2: 21 studies (920 participants) compared different periodontal therapies with each other. There was only very low quality evidence for the multiple head-to-head comparisons, the majority of which were unsuitable to be pooled, and provided no clear evidence of a benefit for one periodontal intervention over another. We were able to pool the specific comparison between scaling and root planing (SRP) plus antimicrobial versus SRP and there was no consistent evidence that the addition of antimicrobials to SRP was of any benefit to delivering SRP alone (mean HbA1c 0.00% lower: 12 studies, 450 participants; 95% CI 0.22% lower to 0.22% higher) at 3-4 months post-treatment, or after 6 months (mean HbA1c 0.04% lower: five studies, 206 patients; 95% CI 0.41% lower to 0.32% higher).</P><P>Less than half of the studies measured adverse effects. The evidence was insufficient to conclude whether any of the treatments were associated with harm. No other patient-reported outcomes (e.g. quality of life) were measured by the included studies, and neither were cost implications or diabetic complications.</P><P>Studies showed varying degrees of success with regards to achieving periodontal health, with some showing high levels of residual inflammation following treatment. Statistically significant improvements were shown for all periodontal indices (BOP, CAL, GI, PI and PPD) at 3-4 and 6 months in comparison 1; however, this was less clear for individual comparisons within the broad category of comparison 2.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 10:29:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>There is low quality evidence that the treatment of periodontal disease by SRP does improve glycaemic control in people with diabetes, with a mean percentage reduction in HbA1c of 0.29% at 3-4 months; however, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that this is maintained after 4 months.</P><P>There was no evidence to support that one periodontal therapy was more effective than another in improving glycaemic control in people with diabetes mellitus.</P><P>In clinical practice, ongoing professional periodontal treatment will be required to maintain clinical improvements beyond 6 months. Further research is required to determine whether adjunctive drug therapies should be used with periodontal treatment. Future RCTs should evaluate this, provide longer follow-up periods, and consider the inclusion of a third 'no treatment' control arm.</P><P>Larger, well conducted and clearly reported studies are needed in order to understand the potential of periodontal treatment to improve glycaemic control among people with diabetes mellitus. In addition, it will be important in future studies that the intervention is effective in reducing periodontal inflammation and maintaining it at lowered levels throughout the period of observation.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-13 14:58:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-13 14:58:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-13 13:02:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jo C Weldon"><P>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease of the metabolism that is caused by the body's failure either to produce the hormone insulin or to effectively use its production of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that enables the body to direct glucose from the bloodstream to cells for energy. Without this vital hormone, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream and can result in disabling and life-threatening complications.</P><P>In 2014, the global prevalence of DM was estimated to be 8.3% among adults over 18 years old (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Estimates produced by the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 387 million people worldwide were affected in 2014, a number that is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035 (<LINK REF="REF-International-Diabetes-Federation-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">International Diabetes Federation 2013</LINK>). In 2011, under the leadership of the World Health Organization, governments agreed a global action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, with a target of reducing global premature deaths in the 30- to 70-year-old age group by 25% by 2025 as part of its overall strategy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Glycaemic control is a key issue in the care of people with DM. Prolonged hyperglycaemia is associated with complications such as retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, macrovascular disease (coronary heart and cerebrovascular disease), foot disease (arising from a combination of vascular and neuropathic disease) and renal failure. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Diabetes Control and Complications trial in the USA have demonstrated that intensive treatment of hyperglycaemia can reduce the risk of long-term complications (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>). Each 1% reduction in the haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the UKPDS was associated with a relative risk reduction of 21% for any diabetes-related endpoint, 21% for diabetes-related deaths, 14% for myocardial infarction and 37% for microvascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>). As part of this process, blood glucose levels may be monitored daily by the patient but also by regular haematological tests in a clinical laboratory. The HbA1c level is commonly measured to assess blood glucose levels over a period of approximately 6 to 8 weeks preceding the test and is recognised as a good indicator of glycaemic control, particularly as higher HbA1c levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bunn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunn 1981</LINK>).</P><P>Poorly controlled diabetes is also a well-recognised risk factor for developing periodontal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Papapanou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papapanou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preshaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preshaw 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sepp_x00e4_l_x00e4_-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppälä 1993</LINK>). There is epidemiological evidence that people with both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) experience more periodontal disease, and periodontal disease of greater severity, than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Firatli-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Firatli 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandberg 2000</LINK>).</P><P>Periodontitis is defined as inflammation and destruction of the underlying supporting tissues of the teeth (the periodontium). In susceptible patients whose oral hygiene is suboptimal, a microbial biofilm (bacteria and extracellular substances) can form around the gum margin and result in inflammation and destruction of the periodontium. This complex, chronic disease requires lifelong control of the causative factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kornman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kornman 2014</LINK>). Reduced periodontal support can lead to mobility (or drifting) of teeth, and ultimately tooth loss; this in turn may require additional treatment to restore lost function and appearance. Chronic inflammation of the periodontium may also lead to systemic inflammation more distantly.</P><P>The condition is categorised as aggressive or chronic (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1999</LINK>). There is no subclass specific to DM, as it is recognised that diabetes may modify all forms of periodontal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Milward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milward 2003</LINK>). Disease severity is graded by measurement of clinical attachment levels (clinical attachment loss, pocket depth, or both if available). It has been estimated that the total surface area of inflamed and ulcerated epithelium of the periodontal tissues in an individual with periodontitis is at least equivalent to the surface area of the palm of the hand (<LINK REF="REF-Page-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Observational studies have demonstrated that associations exist between socioeconomic status (SES: broadly includes ethnicity, income, social class, and education) variables and periodontal disease progression (low education and low income: <LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 2013</LINK>), and SES (low income) and DM prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Rabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabi 2006</LINK>). Consequently, SES may confound observational studies of the association between DM and periodontal disease; however, adequate randomisation in trials of periodontal treatment will avoid such confounding.</P><P>In previous years, evidence has been published suggesting a bidirectional relationship between glycaemic levels and periodontal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Grossi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2001</LINK>). In other words, the chronic inflammation and infection that results from periodontal disease could also have an adverse effect on glycaemic control in people with diabetes, which, in turn, could lead to worsening gum disease.

In many cases, oral hygiene instruction will be used to educate and motivate people to control for themselves the accumulation of causative factors, dental plaque, and bacterial biofilm. In addition, mechanical debridement (different forms of scaling, using conventional hand- or powered-instruments or both) by a dentist or hygienist is often required to remove both plaque and plaque deposits that have mineralised and hardened (calculus). These deposits can form both above and below the gingival margin.</P><P>With more advanced forms of disease, surgery can be needed to lift the gingival tissues away from the tooth, facilitating access to clean away the deposits when located below the gum line. Some of these measures require several visits. Antimicrobials (inclusive of antiseptics, antibacterials and antibiotics) have also been used as adjuncts to scaling, although without evidence of a clear benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Bonito-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonito 2004</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-12 16:06:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Any improvement in glycaemic control resulting from regular and appropriate periodontal treatment has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of diabetic complications and on quality of life for people with diabetes.

The glycated (glycosylated) haemoglobin assay (HbA1c) gained widespread acceptance during the 1980s as the laboratory test of choice and is still widely used. HbA1c has been measured using a number of differing methods with several internationally adopted standards. These include the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) or the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standard tests (their respective standardised values were implemented globally after achieving consensus in 2007 before being refined further in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Hanas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanas 2010</LINK>)). The latter consistently gives lower values (non-diabetic reference range is about 3% to 5% IFCC and 4% to 6% DCCT, with good control in diabetic groups as 5% IFCC and 7% DCCT. Treatment alteration becomes a requirement with values &gt; 6% IFCC and &gt; 8% DCCT (<LINK REF="REF-Florkowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Florkowski 2003</LINK>). We noted methods and reference ranges where given and would have subjected these to sensitivity analysis had the information been available.</P><P>Measures of glycaemic control may, therefore, not be comparable between studies, but the focus of this review was internal comparisons. Some studies measured blood glucose levels (such as plasma glucose fasting levels); however, we did not feel that it was appropriate to use this as an outcome measure. Whilst blood glucose is useful for management on a daily basis (particularly in T1DM), it can be very variable and heavily influenced by many factors like diet, exercise etc. HbA1c gives a better measure of long-term glycaemic control and is shown to be more strongly associated with complications of diabetes than blood glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2004</LINK>).</P><CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2015-11-05 11:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><UL><LI>The absolute percentage change from baseline in HbA1c - from pre-treatment for periodontal condition to at least 90 days post-treatment.</LI></UL><P>The minimum of 3-month follow-up duration, for including studies in this review, is clinically justified due to human red blood cells ordinarily having a lifespan of between 8 to 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Franco-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franco 2012</LINK>).</P><P>We excluded trials that did not measure HbA1c as an outcome (ie where HbA1c is not reported in the trial report or these data are not available from the trial authors).</P></CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY><CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2015-11-05 11:15:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><UL><LI>Changes in periodontal attachment level.</LI><LI>Gingival indices (inflammation or bleeding or both).</LI><LI>Plaque indices.</LI><LI>Any adverse effects of treatment.</LI><LI>Quality of life indicators (eg hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL)).</LI><LI>Cost implications.</LI><LI>Diabetic complications.</LI></UL></CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY></CRIT_OUTCOMES></SELECTION_CRITERIA><SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 11:18:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2015-11-05 11:17:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>For the identification of studies for this review, we developed detailed search strategies for each database searched. These were based on the search strategy developed for MEDLINE but revised appropriately for each database to take account of differences in controlled vocabulary and syntax rules.</P><P>The MEDLINE search strategy was linked with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS) for identifying randomised trials (RCTs) in MEDLINE: sensitivity maximising version (2008 revision) as referenced in Chapter 6.4.11.1 and detailed in box 6.4.c of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for</I> <I>Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>.</I> The searches of EMBASE and CINAHL were linked to the Cochrane Oral Health Group filters for identifying RCTs, and the search of LILACS was linked to the Brazilian Cochrane Center filter.</P><P>We searched the following databases:</P><UL><LI>the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 11);</LI><LI>MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>LILACS via BIREME Virtual Health Library (1982 to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>ISI Web of Knowledge (conference proceedings) (1990 to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>ZETOC (conference proceedings) (1993 to 31 December 2014).</LI></UL><P><I>See</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of all search strategies.<BR/></P></ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES><OTHER_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2015-11-05 11:18:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>We searched the following databases for ongoing trials:</P><UL><LI>US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) (to 31 December 2014);</LI><LI>WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx</A>) (to 31 December 2014).</LI></UL><P>No restrictions were placed on the language of publication when searching the electronic databases, or reviewing reference lists in identified studies or reviews.

We found evidence to demonstrate that the treatment of periodontal disease does improve glycaemic control in people with diabetes, with a mean percentage reduction of 0.29% in HbA1c at 3-4 months. The quality of the body of evidence for this finding was assessed as low.</P><P>To put this in context, the epidemiological analysis of <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK> data indicated that for every percentage point decrease in HbA1c, there was a 35% reduction in the risk of microvascular complications, which appeared to be linear; however, we acknowledge that a linear relationship may not exist at lower levels. In a general population, of whom only a minority had diabetes, a lower average HbA1c level by 0.2% was associated with a 10% lower mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 2001</LINK>) over 2-5 years. although the findings of this and other observational studies of people with diabetes are prone to confounding.</P><P>Glycaemic control is only one component of management of diabetes and smoking cessation, weight loss, physical activity and management of dyslipidaemia and hypertension, where appropriate, are particularly important to reduce risk of macrovascular disease. Consequently, the effect of the modest reduction (0.2%) in HbA1c seems unlikely to result in a major population-level effect, particularly as effectiveness of periodontal treatment is only estimated to 3-4 months post-treatment within this review.</P><P>There was no evidence that periodontal treatment results in a significant effect at 6 months. Due to periodontitis being a chronic condition, ongoing maintenance care by clinicians would be prudent to maintain clinical improvements beyond 6 months.</P><P>Further research is still needed to determine whether or not periodontal treatment (with or without adjunctive intervention) provides further benefit with regard to glycaemic control beyond other interventions of known effectiveness including lifestyle and behavioural change and treatment intensification, and perhaps future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) could look at this. Interestingly, another systematic review's meta-analysis (including 19 RCTs, 1431 participants) demonstrated that psychological intervention (counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy or psychodynamic therapy) results in a mean difference (MD) reduction in HbA1c of 0.54% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.83 to -0.23) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 2009</LINK>). While their review is not directly comparable (participants were not diagnosed with periodontitis, and their results pooled the effects of RCTs across a broad range of follow-up periods (4 weeks to 12 months), we highlight that future trials could potentially also consider the use of adjunctive psychological intervention as this may further improve the reduction in HbA1c of 0.29% demonstrated in this review, but that such a design will require quality of life (QoL) to be measured as an outcome within such trials. Trials may be designed to include three arms, including a no periodontal treatment control.</P><P>We also wish to highlight that due to the array of associated factors (eg QoL, diabetic complications) that have been shown to influence glycaemic control, establishing a direct relationship may be particularly difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Chew-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chew 2015</LINK>). Future trials might attempt to address this issue by including the use of health-related QoL assessments and more thoroughly reporting the prevalence of diabetic complications from their sample population.</P><P>There was no evidence of a difference in glycaemic control demonstrated by delivery of different periodontal treatments (comparison 2 in this review).</P><P>There was some variation between studies of the effect of interventions in achieving periodontal health, with some showing high levels of residual inflammation following treatment. For the trials comparing the effect of periodontal therapy with a usual care or no active treatment control group, there was evidence of reductions for all clinical periodontal indices at both 3-4 and 6 months for patients in the periodontal therapy group.</P><P>There were several head-to-head studies comparing different periodontal treatments. There was no clear evidence that one treatment was more effective than another.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 12:47:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The review assessed a varied population with a wide age range, good gender balance and varied glycaemic control (HbA1c thresholds) who were using different forms of antidiabetic therapy; however, information about socioeconomic status (SES) and body mass index (BMI) were rarely reported, raising doubts concerning the applicability of the evidence to people of various sizes and socioeconomic backgrounds.</P><P>The studies included in the meta-analyses all provided HbA1c data, however, adverse events were seldom reported. Participation in the trials might have resulted in patients monitoring their blood sugars and taking better care of their health, by complying with their medication more than they normally would. This might have resulted in an overestimation of the benefit of periodontal interventions due to potential Hawthorne effect impact (<LINK REF="REF-McCambridge-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCambridge 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Overall, we find the evidence presented in this review to be pragmatic as the results of most of the studies were analysed by intention-to-treat (ITT); however, there was some variation between studies of the effect of interventions in achieving periodontal health, with some showing high levels of residual inflammation following treatment. As the postulated effect of scaling and root planing (SRP) on glycaemic control is predicated upon reduced periodontal inflammation, reduced efficacy of the intervention may have restricted the potential to show benefit.</P><P>A recent cross-sectional survey (<LINK REF="REF-Kowall-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kowall 2015</LINK>) concluded that having pre-diabetes or well-controlled T2DM (defined in their study as a known HbA1c level of &lt; 7.0%) was not associated with a greater prevalence of periodontitis or edentulism; however, their paper implies an association exists for people with HbA1c levels greater than 7.0%.</P><P>Considering the implications of their findings, we highlight an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Khader-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khader 2010</LINK>) excluded by our own review due to its use of a non-periodontal intervention, full mouth tooth extraction (FME). This study, of 58 T2DM participants diagnosed with severe periodontitis, excluded patients with a baseline HbA1c level up to 7.0% (being considered to have well-controlled T2DM), and randomised included participants (all of whose remaining teeth were deemed to be in a hopeless condition and indicated for extraction regardless) to receive FME or no treatment (delayed FME). <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=037104012901025074&amp;versionPK1=z1511060918586927669091356582655&amp;versionPK2=z1511060958116590534581750569837#STD-Khader-2010">Khader 2010</A>'s choice of intervention potentially addresses our hypothesis in a situation where all periodontal disease may be presumed to be eliminated by use of FME. Significant reductions in mean HbA1c were demonstrated by the intervention group (FME recipients) at both 3 months follow-up (MD -0.95%; 95% CI 1.41% lower to 0.49% lower), and 6 months follow-up also (MD -1.09%; 95% CI 1.57% lower to 0.61% lower). The improvement detected in this study suggests that the benefits of eliminating infection or inflammation associated with periodontal disease in people with T2DM are likely to be centred on those with both poor metabolic control and with the most severe presentation of periodontal disease.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-04 15:59:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The quality of the body of evidence was low due to high risk of bias, moderate to substantial heterogeneity and serious imprecision.</P><P>All the included studies were at high risk of bias except six studies, two (6%) at low risk of bias and four (11%) at unclear risk of bias. Bias was due to inadequate randomisation/allocation concealment in four (11%) studies, selective reporting in seven (20%) studies and attrition in 14 (40%) studies. However, the main source of bias was lack of blinding of participants and clinical operator which led to performance bias in 22 (63%) studies.This occurred in studies involving interventions that were mechanical in nature, for which blinding was not possible.</P><P>There was little evidence of heterogeneity across the studies despite differences in intervention delivery and various treatment combinations. There was no indirectness nor publication bias detected.</P><P>When compared to usual care/no active treatment, different periodontal treatments showed consistently significant effects at 3-4 months follow-up.

Consequently, we are satisfied that <LINK REF="STD-Engebretson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretson 2013</LINK>'s clinical conduct is not of sufficient concern to warrant post-hoc sensitivity analyses excluding its contribution, and have confidence in its findings being consistent with those of other included studies.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 14:25:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-11-05 14:27:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>There is low quality evidence that the treatment of periodontal disease by scaling and root planing does improve glycaemic control in people with diabetes, with a mean percentage reduction in HbA1c of 0.29% at 3-4 months; however, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that this is maintained after 4 months.</P><P>There was no evidence to support that one periodontal therapy was more effective than another in improving glycaemic control in people with diabetes.</P><P>In clinical practice, ongoing professional periodontal treatment will be required to maintain clinical improvements beyond 6 months. Further research is required to determine whether adjunctive drug therapies should be used with periodontal treatment. Future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should evaluate this, provide longer follow-up periods, and consider the inclusion of a third 'no treatment' control arm.</P><P>Larger, well conducted and clearly reported studies are needed in order to understand the potential of periodontal treatment to improve glycaemic control among people with diabetes. In addition, it will be important in future studies that the intervention is effective in reducing periodontal inflammation and maintaining it at lowered levels throughout the period of observation.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-06 14:25:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Further studies to confirm or refute these findings should be viewed as a public health priority in view of the prevalence of both periodontal disease and diabetes, and the potential impact of impaired diabetes management on morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We suggest a two-phase approach to investigating the importance of periodontal disease treatment on diabetes.</P><P>Firstly, a limited number of additional RCTs should be conducted investigating the impact of periodontal therapy on glycaemic control, with at least 6 months follow-up after treatment completion. Withholding treatment for the control group is not ethical. This could be managed, as with some of the reported studies, by the control group continuing with 'usual care' for the duration of the trial (eg <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2007</LINK>: examples might include supragingival prophylaxis, standalone oral hygiene instruction or other reasonable oral care treatments), with rescue treatment provided for progressing periodontal disease. Trials should clearly report the occurrence of adverse events, and the use of antidiabetic therapy at baseline and changes to such therapy during the study periods (treatment phase and follow-up, ideally separately).</P><P>Each trial should be large enough to have sufficient power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference if it exists. The data from the existing trials should be able to provide data for such a calculation (allowing for losses to follow-up). Definitions of periodontal disease and diabetes should be clear, and studies should use the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> statement to ensure adequate and transparent reporting of methodology. Trialists should also use the data from this systematic review and meta-analyses to inform their own study designs, and to share the results of new/ongoing trials to update collective findings and determine the overall totality of the evidence. In view of the many potential confounders that exist with a disease such as diabetes, study designs should also include data relating to age, duration, medication, smoking, HbA1c assessment standard (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) or the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC)) and recognised diabetes-related complications.</P><P>The intervention and clinical setting should be appropriate for the severity of periodontitis (eg mild to moderate severity periodontitis should be treated in a similar way to primary or community care provision capabilities, whereas severe periodontitis may require specialist skills), and additional supportive maintenance care should be provided to the intervention group (as per usual practice) for studies in excess of 3 to 4 months duration. It will be important for future studies that the intervention is effective in both reducing periodontal inflammation, and maintaining it at lowered levels throughout the period of observation. In addition, studies should investigate the impact of periodontal therapy on both people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, tobacco consumption status/duration since smoking cessation, glycaemic control, and have sufficient included participants in each group to determine the treatment response in both groups.</P><P>Secondly, if the evidence clearly indicates a potentially clinically significant benefit, community-based trials should be conducted. Future research may involve close co-operative working between researchers with dental/periodontal and medical backgrounds. Such studies might include a variety of research designs, depending on the question to be addressed. For instance, multicentred and/or international (including high income and low- to middle-income countries) RCTs (and possibly cluster-randomised trials) should be considered for addressing the question of the impact of periodontal therapy on control of diabetes. As well as glycaemic control, trials should measure quality of life and diabetes complications. Health economic evaluation is also important. Qualitative research could be used to address questions relating to barriers/facilitators of oral health and diabetes care, and preferences and experiences of patients. Furthermore, patient involvement in the design and conduct of these studies is strongly recommended.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 23:20:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank the Cochrane Oral Health Group (Cochrane OHG) for its support in undertaking this updated review: specifically, Anne Littlewood for running the searches; Laura MacDonald<B>, </B>Luisa Fernandez Mauleffinch and Anne-Marie Glenny for providing editorial and methodological comments; and Luisa Fernandez Mauleffinch for copy editing this review.</P><P>Our thanks to Rahul Alam, Deborah Matthews, Didac Mauricio and Hugo Pinto for peer-refereeing the clinical content of this review.</P><P>Additionally, we recognise the contribution from Cochrane OHG's translators: Chunjie Li (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>), Andreas Neudecker (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 1988</LINK>) and Farhad Shokraneh (<LINK REF="STD-Haerian-Ardakani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Haerian Ardakani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansouri-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mansouri 2006</LINK>).</P><P>Particular thanks are due to the trial authors who provided unpublished information that allowed more thorough appraisal of studies: Mohammed Al-Zahrani (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Zahrani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Zahrani 2009</LINK>), Mary Cullinan (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12605000260628" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12605000260628</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12605000340639" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12605000340639</LINK>), Poliana Mendes Duarte (<LINK REF="STD-Miranda-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Miranda 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2012</LINK>), Elena Firkova (<LINK REF="STD-Yun-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yun 2007</LINK>), Cristiane Miranda França (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01964833" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01964833</LINK>), &#321;ukasz Gilowski (<LINK REF="STD-Gilowski-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gilowski 2012</LINK>), Sara Grossi (<LINK REF="STD-Grossi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Grossi 1997</LINK>), Judith Jones (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2007</LINK>), Sayaka Katagiri (<LINK REF="STD-Katagiri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Katagiri 2009</LINK>), Panagiotis Koromantzos (<LINK REF="STD-Koromantzos-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Koromantzos 2011</LINK>), Shaila Patil Kothiwale (<LINK REF="STD-Kothiwale-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kothiwale 2013</LINK>), Fernando Llambés (<LINK REF="STD-Llamb_x00e9_s-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Llambés 2008</LINK>), Thomas Oates (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00801164" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00801164</LINK>), Rok Schara (<LINK REF="STD-Skaleric-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Skaleric 2004</LINK>), Jean Suvan (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN83229304" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN83229304</LINK>), Mario Taba (<LINK REF="STD-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>), Elif Unsal (<LINK REF="STD-Kiran-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kiran 2005</LINK>),and Jean-Noel Vergnes (<LINK REF="STD-Calbacho-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Calbacho 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansouri-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mansouri 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN15334496" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN15334496</LINK>).</P><P>We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Edward Mills to the original published review.</P><P>Finally, particular thanks are expressed by Terry Simpson to Richard Ibbetson for his personal support and guidance during this review's initial conception.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:57:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Terry C Simpson (TS): none known.<BR/>Jo Weldon (JW): none known.
