<TITLE>Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:58:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We last searched for evidence on 18 October 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children.</P>
<P>Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long-term care for adults with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials.</P>
<P>We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:02:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:02:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:02:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements.</P>
<P>Last search: 18 October 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:02:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 14:08:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:08:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI -0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (-0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro-intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:56:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short-term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long-term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder affecting many organs including the lungs, gastro-intestinal tract, pancreas and liver. Failure to thrive is a common means of presentation of undiagnosed children with CF; and poor nutrition may be a problem in the children and adults diagnosed with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1980</LINK>). This may worsen as the disease progresses. In recent years guidelines have recommended that dietary intake should provide at least 120% of the recommended daily allowance for energy in people with cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sinaasappel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinaasappel 2002</LINK>). This increased calorie requirement is contributed to by multiple factors. These include malabsorption and, in children or adults with more advanced chest disease, it may also be contributed to by increased work of breathing or chronic pulmonary sepsis. In addition, when unwell, people with CF may have reduced appetite. It was suggested by studies in the 1980s that there was an increased energy requirement associated with the basic defect of CF (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1988</LINK>), but this is now disputed and resting energy expenditure in clinical stable children with CF has been shown to be similar to control children without CF (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2004</LINK>). Poor nutrition has been associated with adverse outcomes in CF and therefore nutritional management is directed at maintaining normal weight and height for age in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1996</LINK>). There is a further systematic review which assesses the effectiveness of this intervention for children with chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-19 16:22:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Oral calorie supplements (OCS) are usually in the form of either fortified milk or juice drinks or simple energy sources.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-19 16:22:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>These supplements are used to try and increase the total daily calorie intake and thereby improve weight gain. Provided calorie supplements are taken in addition to normal dietary intake from food, then overall calorie intake should be improved.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:09:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>However, it is possible that OCS may replace some of the calories taken as food and their potential effect on overall total calorie intake be either reduced or eliminated. A further potential adverse consequence of replacing calorie intake from normal food by calories from OCS may be to have a detrimental effect on normal eating behaviour, which is particularly critical in toddlers and young children who are learning to develop normal eating behaviour. In addition, OCS are expensive and therefore it is important to evaluate their effectiveness. The cost for a 10-year old child is about £1124 per annum in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-RLCH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">RLCH 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an updated version of previously published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2014</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-19 16:23:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To examine the evidence that in people with CF oral calorie supplements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>improve measures of nutritional status, lung function and survival and quality of life;</LI>
<LI>increase daily calorie intake, without reducing calorie intake from normal food;</LI>
<LI>are associated with adverse effects in people with CF, which are either important to the individual or have long-term sequelae. These may include diarrhoea, reduced appetite, and bloating.</LI>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:02:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In order to establish a risk of bias for each included trial, each author assessed the methodological quality of each trial. In particular, authors examined details of generation of the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. If these were considered adequate the authors deemed the trial to be at low risk of bias. The authors also assessed whether the trial was blinded. The more people blinded to an intervention (participants, clinicians and outcome assessors), the lower the risk of bias would be for that trial. The authors also examined whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible from the available data and if the number of participants lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the trial was recorded. Any trials which did not discuss or account for missing data or participants was thought to have a potential risk of bias. For quasi-randomised studies, each author examined the baseline characteristics of the intervention and comparison groups to assess whether the two groups were comparable. If groups were not comparable, there would be a risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:11:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>For binary outcome measures, we aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across trials (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls). For continuous outcomes, we recorded either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment/intervention values and standard deviation or standard error for each group. We aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by determining the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings and quality of the evidence (GRADE)</HEADING>
<P>In a post hoc change from protocol, we have presented a summary of findings tables for the comparison of oral calorie supplements compared to control (no intervention, dietary advice or nutritional counselling) for adults and children with CF (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)</P>
<P>The following outcomes were reported in the tables (chosen based on relevance to clinicians and consumers): change in weight (kg), change in height (cm), change in total calories (kcal/day), change in total protein (g/day), change in total fat (g/day), adverse events, lung function (change in per cent (%) predicted FEV&#8321;). All outcomes are reported at 12 months.</P>
<P>We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach; and downgraded evidence in the presence of a high risk of bias in at least one study, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results, high probability of publication bias. We downgraded evidence by one level if they considered the limitation to be serious and by two levels if very serious.</P>

<P>Two trials were RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>) and one was a quasi-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). All three were of parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). Two trials were single centre (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>) and one was multicentre with included participants recruited from 17 hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). All three trials had differing durations: in one the intervention was given for three months with a total of six months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>); in the second trial the intervention was given for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>); and in the third trial, the intervention was given for 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial was an explanatory trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>) (an explanatory trial is one which looks at biological mechanisms, rather than one which aims to provide sound treatment recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>)). The main aim of this trial was to investigate the relationship between nutritional status and skeletal muscle strength. Since they are investigating the biological effects of treatment, explanatory trials usually only analyse the information on individuals who completed treatment, which was the case in this trial. Two trials presented data using an ITT analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>).</P>

Two trials enrolled children up to 15 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>) and one trial included both children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). In two studies there were almost equal numbers of males and females (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>), but in one trial there were more females (n = 10) than males (n = 3) (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:14:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In the trial by Hanning and the CALICO trial, generation of the randomisation sequence was based on a table of random numbers and so we judged these trials to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). In the trial by Kalnins, participants were segregated by age and sex and the initial participants from each group were randomly allocated to intervention or control (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). The paper does not give any details of how this randomisation was undertaken, so we deemed this trial to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allocation in the Hanning trial and the CALICO trial was concealed using sealed envelopes and we judged these trials to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). The trial by Kalnins was quasi-randomised, initial participants from each group were randomly allocated to intervention or control, then each subsequent participant was allocated a different group from the previous one (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). We therefore judged this trial to have a potential risk of bias.</P>
</ALLOCATION>
<BLINDING MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:18:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Due to the interventions, blinding of clinicians and participants was not possible in any of the three included trials, but all three trials blinded the outcome assessors for some or all outcomes. In the Hanning trial, investigators performing skeletal and lung muscle-function tests and anthropometry were unaware of the participant's study group (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>). In the CALICO trial, the researcher undertaking the analysis of outcomes was masked as to the allocation groups (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). These two trials were deemed to have some risk of bias. In the Kalnins trial apart from the 'study monitors' (nurse and dietitian), all other investigators were blinded (but it was not clear whether all investigators who assessed the outcome measures were blinded) (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). Due to this fact the risk of bias for this trial is unclear.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In the Hanning trial, an intention-to-treat analysis was not performed (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>); 20 participants were randomised but data from only 16 participants were presented. The paper does give reasons for the four participants withdrawing (they found the time demands for testing or the travelling distance to be excessive) (<LINK REF="STD-Hanning-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hanning 1993</LINK>). We therefore judged this trial to have a low risk of bias from incomplete outcome data.</P>
<P>In the Kalnins trial, two participants (one in each group) dropped out after completing baseline (reasons were feeling unwell and change of mind) and were not followed up (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). Two out of seven participants allocated to the supplement group were not taking supplements at three months, but were included in the analysis, which was judged to be intention to treat (<LINK REF="STD-Kalnins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalnins 2005</LINK>). We judged there to be some risk of bias in this trial since although the withdrawals were described and the analysis was by intention to treat, the drop outs were not equal across groups.</P>
<P>In the CALICO trial, analysis was by intention to treat (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). It was stated that all 102 children randomised completed the trial; however there were some data not available for some of the outcomes. Interim data on two children from the supplement group (due to parental choice or illness) and on one child from the standard care group (due to illness) were not collected. We judged there to be little risk of bias here as the drop outs were equal across groups and for similar reasons. Furthermore, nine children failed to return the baseline diet diary and 39 failed to return the 12-month diet diary (no details given for which group these children were allocated to), so dietary intake data are based on the 58 children who completed both diaries. Spirometry data are available for 70 of the 72 children who were aged over five years, again no details are given as to which group the two missing sets of data were from.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>This Cochrane Review has shown that use of oral protein energy supplements does not improve nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). It suggests that dietary advice alone is a satisfactory approach to the management of people with CF and moderate malnutrition. This has implications for the nutritional management of CF as these products are widely prescribed and are expensive. We feel that oral protein calorie supplements should not be regarded as an essential part of the long-term clinical care of children with CF who are moderately malnourished.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:16:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There are some issues which should be considered when assessing the implications of the review for clinical practice. Firstly, the result of this review was largely contributed to by the CALICO study (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>). This study was conducted in children, not adults, who were moderately malnourished and the intervention given was in the form of oral protein energy supplements, taken as drinks, over the long term. The children generally had good lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;) % predicted was greater than 70%) and did not have severe complications of CF. Therefore one must be cautious in considering whether the results of this review can be applied to adults with more severe lung disease or worse nutritional status or both. Additionally, the short-term use of nutritional supplements as a strategy to treat acute weight loss was not assessed in any other trial included in this review.</P>
<P>Total energy and macronutrient intake in the included trials were assessed by information from diaries. The investigators in the CALICO trial reviewed this carefully and felt that the diary information was likely to be an overestimate of the participants' intake from supplements, as supplement groups seemed to be consuming about 18% more than the standard care group relative to their estimated average requirement for energy intake, but showed no change in nutritional status. Hence reported intake of food and other nutrients by participants should be interpreted with caution in clinical studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-24 13:16:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The quality of the evidence was judged to be moderate for the change in weight and height and low for the change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake (this is because results are applicable only to children between the ages of two and 15 years and many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned). Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-24 13:18:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The authors undertook comprehensive searching for this review so there is unlikely to be any bias due to the non-identification of relevant trials. However, the lead author of the review was also an investigator on the largest included study in the review. To avoid any potential bias from this fact data from that study were extracted and checked by an independent person at the editorial base.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-26 12:16:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Despite the findings of this review, guidelines from the USA (<LINK REF="REF-CFF-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CFF 2016</LINK>) and the UK (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2013</LINK>) continue to provide recommendations for their use, although the statements made are not specific about the clinical situation in which they should be used. A non-Cochrane systematic review states, "For children with growth deficits and adults with weight deficits, the CF Foundation recommends the use of nutritional supplements (oral and enteral) in addition to usual dietary intake to improve the rate of weight gain" (<LINK REF="REF-Stallings-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallings 2008</LINK>), but does not reference this Cochrane Review or the CALICO trial (<LINK REF="STD-Poustie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poustie 2006</LINK>).</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children with CF who are moderately malnourished the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone is an appropriate approach to management. Nutritional supplements may be used but should not be regarded as an essential part of care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The place of oral protein energy supplements in the short-term management of people with CF and acute weight loss should be assessed in randomised controlled trials. The place of this intervention in the long-term management of adults with CF or people with advanced lung disease, or both, should also be assessed in randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>3. Downgraded once due to incomplete outcome data; 58 out of 102 children returned the 12 month dietary diary, 44 who did not return the diary are excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>4. Downgraded twice due to imprecision and once due to risk of selective outcome reporting bias; adverse events of treatment were reported in only a single trial and very limited information was provided about the rate of adverse events.</P>
<P>5. Downgraded once due to applicability; Spirometry data recorded only for children over the age of 5 years, lung function outcomes are not applicable to children between the ages of 2 to 5 years from this study.</P>
