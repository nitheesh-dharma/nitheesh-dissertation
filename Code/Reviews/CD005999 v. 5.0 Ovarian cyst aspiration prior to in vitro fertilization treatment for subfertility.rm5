<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors investigated the effectiveness and safety of cyst aspiration before ovarian stimulation versus a conservative approach (no aspiration) in women undergoing In vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Our primary outcomes were live birth rate and adverse events. We also assessed pregnancy rates, number of follicles recruited, and number of oocytes retrieved.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>IVF is a treatment for infertility in which a woman's eggs (oocytes) are fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish. One or more of the fertilized eggs (embryos) are then transferred into the woman's uterus, where it is hoped the egg will implant and result in a pregnancy.</P>
<P>The woman's ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs which are then retrieved for fertilization by sperm. This differs from what usually occurs, when one egg is produced by the ovary. Stimulation of the ovaries is achieved by a woman taking several different drugs to maximise the chance of getting several eggs suitable for fertilization. Prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) a baseline ultrasound is performed to detect the presence of any functional ovarian cysts. The evidence on the effect of draining such an ovarian cyst on the end result of IVF was examined in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Three randomized controlled trials were included involving 339 women of reproductive age who required IVF treatment due to tubal factor infertility, anovulation, male factor infertility, endometriosis or fertility of unknown cause. These studies compared the outcome of IVF cycles in women whose cyst was drained versus the outcomes when the cyst was not drained. The evidence was current to April 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported live birth rates or adverse event rates. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in the pregnancy rate, the number of follicles recruited, or the number of eggs retrieved, between women who had their cyst drained and women who did not.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons, the main reasons for this being small study numbers, low numbers of events and poor reporting of study methods. There was inconsistent reporting of study findings in one RCT, which meant that some of the data could not be used</P>

<P>Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two review authors. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and adverse events. The overall quality of the evidence for each comparison was rated using GRADE methods.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:07:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 339), all of which used agonist protocols. Neither live birth rate nor adverse events were reported by any of the included studies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate between the group who underwent ovarian cyst aspiration and the conservatively managed group (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.29, two RCTs, 159 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, very low quality evidence). This suggested that if the clinical pregnancy rate in women with conservative management was assumed to be 6%, the chance following cyst aspiration would be between 2% and 22%. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the mean number of follicles recruited (0.55 follicles, 95% CI -0.48 to 1.59, 2 studies, 159 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, very low quality evidence) mean number of oocytes collected (0.41 oocytes, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.85, 3 studies, 339 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, low quality evidence) or cancellation rate (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.33, one RCT, 122 women, very low quality evidence). The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods, and inconsistent reporting of study findings in one RCT which meant that some of the data could not be used.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether drainage of functional ovarian cysts prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation influences rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, number of follicles recruited, or number of oocytes collected in women with a functional ovarian cyst.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-10 16:47:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-12-10 16:47:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Ten per cent to 15% of couples have difficulty in conceiving (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2011</LINK>). A proportion of these couples will ultimately require assisted reproduction, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Prior to IVF the pituitary is down-regulated with either gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), using long, short or flare-up protocols, or the use of a GnRH antagonist. The GnRHa functions to suppress endogenous pituitary gonadotropin secretion by down-regulation of receptors and thereby prevents a premature luteinising hormone (LH) surge during exogenous gonadotropin stimulation. The advantage of a GnRHa is that it reduces the need for frequent LH monitoring and reduces cycle cancellation due to premature luteinisation, prior to oocyte retrieval. The downside of using a GnRHa is that it sometimes blunts the response of the ovary to gonadotropin stimulation and increases the dose and duration of gonadotropin therapy required to stimulate follicular development.</P>
<P>Another option for ovarian stimulation is the use of GnRH antagonists, which block the GnRH receptor in a dose-dependent, competitive fashion. The advantage of using a GnRH antagonist is that gonadotropin suppression is almost immediate and therefore the duration of treatment is substantially decreased compared to a cycle using a GnRHa (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2011</LINK>). Secondly, GnRH antagonists do not cause the same flare effect as cycles using GnRHa, therefore the risk of stimulating the development of a functional ovarian cyst is reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Depalo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Depalo 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to ovarian stimulation a baseline ultrasound is performed to detect the presence of functional ovarian cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Greenebaum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenebaum 1992</LINK>). An incidence of up to 13.6% of functional ovarian cysts has been reported in the literature following pituitary down-regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Ron_x002d_El-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ron-El 1989</LINK>). A large variation in incidence is due to the differences in the definition of an ovarian cyst that is used, the age and ovarian reserve of the women, type of protocol, and small sample sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous research has suggested that there is a relationship between the presence of a functional ovarian cyst prior to ovarian stimulation and poor outcome during IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1993</LINK>). It is proposed that the presence of a baseline functional ovarian cyst disrupts the final stages of folliculogenesis by reducing the area available for follicular development and by altering local angiogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 1999</LINK>). Some authors report that there are no effects on the clinical response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) (<LINK REF="REF-Hornstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penzias-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penzias 1992</LINK>) whilst others have documented greater gonadotropin utilisation when a conservative approach is used. These authors found that this approach resulted in subsequent lower numbers of oocytes retrieved and consequently lower pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeyneloglu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeyneloglu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact mechanism of ovarian cyst formation remains unclear. Several explanations have been suggested (<LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK>) and these include the effect of primary flare-up caused by the GnRHa affecting gonadotropins; inadequate suppression of circulating gonadotropins following pituitary suppression; the direct effect of GnRHa on the ovaries and subsequent steroidogenesis; the quantity of progesterone at the time of GnRH therapy; and the persistence of a follicular or corpus luteum cyst formed in the preceding cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-09 10:31:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Different methods have been employed to manage these functional ovarian cysts and include continuing the GnRHa suppression, the administration of a combined oral contraceptive pill until the cyst has resolved (a conservative approach), and surgical cyst aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Biljan--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biljan 1998</LINK>). Some authors report that the presence of such ovarian cysts do not impact on the subsequent clinical response to COH in IVF cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Hornstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penzias-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penzias 1992</LINK>). Meanwhile, other authors are concerned that longer suppression with GnRHa is associated with greater gonadotropin utilisation, fewer mature oocytes, and consequently lower pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeyneloglu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeyneloglu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Possible adverse events might include infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding structures, need for further surgery including oophorectomy, anaesthetic complications, and the costs of both the procedure itself and any subsequent complications. Ovarian cyst aspiration is generally a simple procedure however complications may occasionally arise.</P>
<P>The transvaginal route has the disadvantage of being semi-sterile, and this carries with it a potential risk of infecting pelvic structures. Bleeding and bowel injury have been reported however the risk of these complications is low due to the inherent advantage of real time ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). The most common complication is infection, which has been reported in one study to occur at a rate of 1.3%. In both reported cases in this study the resulting pelvic infection caused the loss of an ovary (Rizk B, Kingsland C, unpublished data). Although low risk, the possibility of this complication should be considered in women with a single ovary.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-09 10:32:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Some studies have suggested that ovarian cysts may decrease the chance of pregnancy in an IVF cycle as their presence may increase the risk of cycle cancellation (<LINK REF="REF-Keltz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keltz 1995</LINK>). An adverse effect of ovarian cysts on the outcome of IVF could be mediated by three mechanisms (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>1. A potential endocrine effect with disruption of the final stages of the preovulatory follicles. This is thought to be mediated by early luteinisation, premature LH surge and rise of progesterone levels thereby reducing oocyte quality and producing a negative effect on the endometrium.</P>
<P>2. A mechanical effect whereby the ovarian cyst may physically reduce the space for other follicles to develop.</P>
<P>3. Alteration of the blood supply to the detriment of follicular development by reducing the number and quality of oocytes collected.</P>
<P>IIt has been suggested that the aspiration of these functional ovarian cysts prior to the commencement of COH may increase the live birth rate.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-20 23:09:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this Cochrane review was to determine whether aspiration of simple, functional ovarian cysts (&gt; 20 mm) prior to COH improves the number of follicles recruited, the number of oocytes retrieved, and subsequent live birth rates. This information would provide guidance to health consumers and IVF providers on the impact of this intervention. Considering the requirement for anaesthesia, extra cost, anxiety related to undergoing a surgical procedure and risk of surgical complications, it may be wise to treat women with ovarian cysts who are undergoing IVF treatment conservatively until evidence is available for this procedure.</P>

<P>The 95% CIs were presented for all outcomes. Where data were not available to calculate ORs or MDs we utilized the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of the included studies (for example test statistics, P values).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:57:45 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the three included trials we noted the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Different definitions of functional ovarian cysts were used in each study. <LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK> defined an ovarian cyst as a unilocular or bilocular sonolucent cystic structure with mean diameters between 20 mm and 60 mm. <LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK> defined an ovarian cyst as an ovarian structure with sonolucent thin walls &gt; 25 mm in diameter. <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2006</LINK> defined an ovarian cyst as a thin-walled intraovarian sonolucent structure with a mean diameter of &#8805; 15 mm and E<SUB>2</SUB> levels of &#8805; 50&#961;g/ml; the mean diameter of cysts in the participants in this study was 21 to 22 mm (SD 6).</LI>
<LI>In addition to investigating the effect of unilateral ovarian cysts on IVF outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2006</LINK> presented data on the cycle characteristics and IVF outcome of women who developed bilateral functional ovarian cysts. They found that women with bilateral ovarian cysts had a significantly higher E<SUB>2 </SUB>level and a higher proportion of poor quality embryos (P &lt; 0.05) compared to those with a unilateral functional ovarian cyst. Moreover, the number of follicles &gt; 14 mm, number of oocytes retrieved, and number of day 2 embryos were significantly lower compared with the unilateral cyst group. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancellation rate, number of embryos transferred, fertilization, pregnancy and abortion rates.</LI>
<LI>A long luteal phase pituitary down-regulation cycle with a GnRHa is still the standard form of ovarian down-regulation performed worldwide, however the GnRH antagonist approach to prevent an endogenous LH surge is now increasingly used in many IVF units. The three included trials utilized a standardized pituitary down-regulation protocol, namely long luteal pituitary down-regulation using GnRHa.</LI>
<LI>Two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK>) did not provide details on the cause of infertility for their patients undergoing IVF, so these results should be applied with caution to the greater IVF population.</LI>
<LI>Duration of IVF treatment until completion of treatment, live birth rate, and discontinuation of IVF treatment were not reported.</LI>
<LI>The overall number of women treated in the three trials was small (339), therefore the results from this review should be interpreted with caution when incorporating the results into clinical practice.</LI>
<LI>One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK>) is 23 years old and the methods utilized in modern IVF practices have changed substantially. Some of these changes include alterations in the culture medium used, demographic changes in patients seeking fertility treatment, and differing IVF protocols. Applying the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.</LI>
<LI>Unequal randomization was seen in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2006</LINK>. The reason for this is not clear and this is a potential source of bias. The authors were contacted for clarification however further information did not become available.</LI>
<LI>Clinical heterogeneity exists between the trials, mainly with respect to differing inclusion criteria, slightly different IVF protocols, and differing definitions of an ovarian cyst. Despite this, the authors felt that the derived data were applicable to those women currently undergoing IVF and that the subsequent meta-analysis was meaningful.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity exists between the included studies as the study by <LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1990</LINK> had no cycles cancelled prior to oocyte retrieval. <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2006</LINK> had a cycle cancellation rate per cycle of 23.7% in the aspirated group and 23.9% in the non-aspirated group due to inadequate response to ovarian stimulation. <LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK> had a cycle cancellation rate per cycle of 2.2% and 14.9% (but did not make it clear which rate applied to which group)</LI>
<LI>The cancellation rates reported in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2006</LINK> were higher than the expected rate of 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Inany-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Inany 2011</LINK>). This may be attributed to the age of the data and different healthcare settings. In a setting where the patient is required to purchase all medications used and pay for all theatre costs, cycles may be cancelled if the numbers of follicles are low. In these instances the cancellation rate reported may be higher than what would usually be expected. Applying the results of this review should therefore be interpreted with caution.</LI>
<LI>The pregnancy rates recorded in the studies would be considered low by today's standards, hence the current applicability of these studies may be questioned.</LI>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:57:45 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No evidence was available for live birth, as this outcome was not reported by the included studies.</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence for clinical pregnancy rate, number of follicles recruited, and number of oocytes collected was low or very low. Limitations included poor reporting of study methods, as none of the studies adequately described their methods of randomization and allocation concealment. Moreover, some of the data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK> were unusable due to inconsistency. Findings were imprecise, as the total number of events was low and confidence intervals were wide.</P>
<P>Findings were consistent across all studies despite differences in the definition of ovarian cyst and other methodological differences between the studies.</P>
<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for information regarding the individual studies.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:57:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unaware of any potential biases in the review process that were likely to have influenced our findings. However, a funnel plot was not constructed as the number of studies was small. We were therefore unable to assess the risk of publication bias. Moreover, planned sensitivity analyses were not performed due to lack of data.</P>
<P>The absence of cycle cancellation as an outcome was recognised as a methodological weakness. As a result, we included cycle cancellation rate per cycle as a secondary outcome.</P>
<P>We feel confident that all relevant studies have been included as the search terms used were broadened varied, and resulted in a comprehensive literature search. The literature search was repeated in April 2014 to capture additional studies published since the initial literature search (April 2013).</P>
<P>We were unable to contact lead authors in the field. One plausible source of bias would be the lack of response from the original trialists when asked to provide additional data.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-21 00:44:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether drainage of functional ovarian cysts prior to COH influences live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, the number of follicles recruited, or oocytes collected in women with a functional ovarian cyst. The findings of this review do not provide supportive evidence for this approach, particularly in view of the requirement for anaesthesia, extra cost, psychological stress and risk of surgical complications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:57:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the need for well powered, well designed randomized controlled trials to further evaluate the role of cyst aspiration in women undergoing IVF treatment. Future trials need to be rigorous in design and delivery and with subsequent reporting to include high quality descriptions of all aspects of methodology to enable appraisal and interpretation of results. Current evidence lacks data on live birth rates and adverse events related to aspiration of ovarian cysts. Research conducted in the future should report these outcomes to maximise the care of women undergoing IVF in whom ovarian cysts are detected.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-08-30 09:59:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adverse events, including infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding structures, need for further surgery including oophorectomy, anaesthetic complications, and costs of both the procedure itself and any subsequent complications, have been added as a primary outcome.</P>
<P>Cancellation rate per cycle has been added as a secondary outcome between publication of the review protocol and the review. We planned to report this outcome in "Other data" rather than in a forest plot. However, as the relevant study only included one cycle, we were able to report this as "per woman" data.</P>
<P>An additional author has been added between the publication of the review protocol and the review, and two authors moved to 'Acknowledgements'.</P>
<P>We have revised the methods section of the review to reflect current Cochrane standards for conducting and reporting reviews.</P>
<P>The effect estimate used in the final review was the Mantel-Haenszel OR with 95% CI. In the protocol it was documented that the Peto OR would be used, and this was altered to the Mantel-Haenszel OR prior to final publication.</P>

<P>For both groups on day 21 of their menstrual cycle, stimulation was implemented first with GnRHa and then with HMG (human menopausal gonadotrophin). On the second day of their menstrual cycle and prior to HMG stimulation FSH, LH and E2 (estradiol) were measured, and on the eight day of the cycle following the stimulation, a transvaginal ultrasound was performed. In cyst aspiration group the cysts were aspirated and ultrasonography was carried out every 3 to 4 days. If at least three follicles with a diameter more than 17 mm were observed 10,000 units of HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) would be administered in a single dose. In the no intervention group, following the cyst diagnosis, the conservative treatment was continued and routine ultrasonography was performed. Again if three follicles with a diameter of more than 17 mm were observed a single dose of 10,000 units of HCG was administered. E2 hormone levels were measured for all the women on the same day as HCG administration. In both groups 36 hours after HCG administration, oocyte aspiration was performed and the fetus was transferred 24 to 48 hours later. The pregnancy detection was based chemically on the positive Beta HCG (&gt; 10 IU) and clinically on the observation of a pregnancy sac on ultrasonography at the gestational age of 6 weeks.</P>

<P>Dr Spath pointed out that there is a discrepancy in one of the reviewed original papers (<LINK REF="STD-Firouzabadi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Firouzabadi 2010</LINK>): the Results section states different findings from the numbers in the Table (with an opposite direction of effect). This applies to the outcomes of clinical pregnancy and cancellation rate.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-08-30 09:59:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors agree that there is a discrepancy here. As we have been unable to contact the authors of the primary study, we have removed the data for this study from the analyses of clinical pregnancy and cancellation rate.</P>
