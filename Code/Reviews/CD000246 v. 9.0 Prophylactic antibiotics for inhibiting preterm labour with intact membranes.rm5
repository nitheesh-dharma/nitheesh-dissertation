<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the King 2002.<BR/>
<BR/>In this update, the title has been changed to 'Prophylactic antibiotics for inhibiting preterm labour with intact membranes' to clarify the focus of the review. Also in this update, changes have been made to the descriptions of some outcomes measures and subgroup analyses as follows:<BR/>Several additional important neonatal outcomes have been included.<BR/>Subgroup analyses by type of antibiotics have been modified to enhance clinical relevance as follows:<BR/>1. 'Single antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotics' - description changed to 'Macrolide antibiotics versus no antibiotics'.<BR/>2. 'Combination antibiotics therapy versus no antibiotics' - description changed to 'Macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotics versus no antibiotics'.<BR/>These changes are indicated by * in the review.<BR/>
<BR/>This update includes the addition of data from the <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> trial. The earlier version of this review contained data for the outcomes of 1187 women. With the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> trial, this review now contains outcomes for 7428 women.<BR/>
<BR/>The earlier version indicated some maternal and neonatal benefits (less maternal and neonatal infection, some prolongation of pregnancy) and a concern about increased perinatal mortality. With the inclusion of data from <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> in this update, these 'benefits' (with the exception of reduced maternal infection) are no longer apparent, but there is a concern about a trend towards increased neonatal mortality.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-31 13:15:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>We found no benefit for the use of antibiotics for women going into labour too early, with their membranes still intact.</P>
<P>Maternal infection in the cervix or uterus may trigger preterm labour even if the infection does not cause symptoms (low grade infection). Preterm babies can have a range of complications, which often require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, for example, because of breathing problems. Complications of being born early may result in death or longer-term disability such as chronic lung disease or cerebral palsy. Our systematic review of randomised trials, which included a total of 14 studies randomising 7837 women in preterm labour at a mean gestational age of 30 to 32 weeks compared routine administration of antibiotics before membrane rupture with placebo or no treatment for women without signs of infection. While antibiotics reduced the number of women who developed infections, they did not improve outcomes for the infant in terms of birth before 36 to 37 weeks, perinatal deaths or admission to neonatal intensive care or special care with serious illness. The review also found that antibiotic therapy was associated with an increase in neonatal deaths, functional impairment and cerebral palsy at seven years of age. The results of this review supports not giving antibiotics to women in threatened preterm labour with intact membranes who did not have clear signs of infection.</P>

<P>The aetiology of preterm birth is complex and there is evidence that subclinical genital tract infection influences preterm labour in some women but the role of prophylactic antibiotic treatment in the management of preterm labour is controversial. Since rupture of the membranes is an important factor in the progression of preterm labour, it is important to see if the routine administration of antibiotics confers any benefit or causes harm, prior to membrane rupture.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-08 13:37:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>In this update (2013), with the addition of three trials (305 women), the large ORACLE II 2001 trial continues to dominate the results of this review. This review now includes a total of 14 studies randomising 7837 women. No significant difference was shown in perinatal or infant mortality for infants of women allocated to any prophylactic antibiotics compared with no antibiotics. However, an increase in neonatal deaths was shown for infants of women receiving any prophylactic antibiotics when compared with placebo (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.40; NNTH 149, 95% CI 2500 to 61). No reduction in preterm birth or other clinically important short-term outcomes for the infant were shown.</P>
<P>Long-term child outcomes to seven years of age were available for infants in the UK enrolled in the ORACLE II trial. Comparing any antibiotics with placebo, a marginally non-statistically significant increase was shown in any functional impairment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23) and cerebral palsy (CP) (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.34). In subgroup analysis, CP was statistically significantly increased for infants of women allocated to macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotics combined compared with placebo (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.02 to 7.88; NNTH 35, 95% CI 333 to 9).</P>
<P>Further, exposure to any macrolide antibiotics (including erythromycin alone or erythromycin plus co-amoxiclav) versus no macrolide antibiotics (including placebo and co-amoxiclav alone) was shown to increase neonatal death (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.19; NNTH 139, 95% CI 1429 to 61), any functional impairment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; NNTH 24, 95% CI 263 to 13) and CP (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.01; NNTH 64, 95% CI 286 to 29). Exposure to any beta-lactam (beta-lactam alone or in combination with macrolide antibiotics) versus no beta-lactam antibiotics resulted in more neonatal deaths (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.15; NNTH 143, 95% CI 1250 to 63) and CP (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.61; NNTH 79, 95% CI 909 to 33), however no difference was shown in functional impairment.</P>
<P>Maternal infection was reduced with the use of any prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86; NNTB 34, 95% CI 24 to 63) and any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92; NNTB 47, 95% CI 31 to 119). However, caution should be exercised with this finding due to the possibility of bias shown by funnel plot asymmetry. Any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics was associated with an increase in maternal adverse drug reaction (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.54; NNTH 17, 95% CI 526 to 7).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-10-31 13:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>This review did not demonstrate any benefit in important neonatal outcomes with the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, although maternal infection may be reduced. Of concern, is the finding of short- and longer-term harm for children of mothers exposed to antibiotics. The evidence supports not giving antibiotics routinely to women in preterm labour with intact membranes in the absence of overt signs of infection.</P>
<P>Further research is required to develop sensitive markers of subclinical infection for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, as this is a group that might benefit from future novel interventions, including new modalities of antibiotic therapy. The results of this review demonstrate the need for future trials in the area of preterm birth to include assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-22 12:18:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-31 13:16:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>Preterm birth is a major contributor to the burden of perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2010</LINK>). The rate of preterm birth has been increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 2007</LINK>), in both high- and low-middle income countries. For example, by 2005 it had risen in the USA from 9.5% in 1981 to 12.7% by 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2006</LINK>). Whilst increases in obstetric intervention have been implicated in rising rates of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2009</LINK>), the greatest proportion of preterm birth occurs as a consequence of spontaneous preterm labour in 40% to 45% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Little progress has been made over the last three decades in reducing the incidence of preterm birth despite a wide range of therapeutic interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Moutquin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moutquin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muglia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muglia 2010</LINK>). The initiation of parturition in humans is complex and still incompletely understood (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>). Of the pathways that play a role in the onset of labour, the three components that appear to be central to initiation and progression of labour are progesterone withdrawal, increasing oxytocin circulation and decidual activation (<LINK REF="REF-Romero-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 2006</LINK>). Of these, decidual activation would seem to be the main pathway by which infection would play a role in preterm labour.</P>
<P>Such mechanisms may be acted upon directly though bacterial stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis or indirectly through a range of microbial endotoxins and inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="REF-Bejar-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bejar 1981</LINK>). Infection may account for approximately 25% to 40% of spontaneous preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2000</LINK>). The presence of <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum</I> and <I>Mycoplasma</I> <I>spp</I>. have been detected in the amniotic fluid of women experiencing preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Yoon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 2003</LINK>). The presence of intra amniotic infection occurs more frequently with earlier gestational ages of preterm birth. The presence of the fetal inflammatory response is linked both to the onset of preterm labour and associated with an increased incidence of longer-term morbidity such as cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Yoon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the contribution of subclinical genital tract infection to the aetiology of preterm birth is recognised, the role of antibiotic treatment in the management of preterm labour with intact membranes remains uncertain. While colonisation or the presence of bacteria, generally of low virulence, in the chorioamnion is common, this alone is insufficient to cause an inflammatory response to initiate preterm labour. As preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes has a major impact on the progression of preterm labour, we considered it important to assess the potential benefit of commencing prophylactic antibiotic therapy (usually given in addition to tocolysis) prior to membrane rupture.</P>
<P>It has also been hypothesised that the type of antibiotic may be important. Bacteriostatic antibiotics such as erythromycin have theoretical advantages over the beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins). The beta-lactams by destroying bacteria, release endotoxins which may increase local inflammatory mediators and adversely impact preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1997</LINK>). However, it has been suggested that erythromycin, through effects on the cardiovascular system, may lead to cerebral ischaemic events (<LINK REF="REF-Kallen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kallen 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, the anaerobic organisms responsible for bacterial vaginosis (especially <I>Bacteroides</I> and <I>Mobiluncus</I> <I>spp</I>.) have been implicated in the aetiology of preterm labour. Antibiotics active against anaerobic organisms (such as clindamycin and metronidazole) may be more effective in prolonging gestation, but only if such organisms are present (<LINK REF="REF-Hauth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauth 1995</LINK>). Other genital tract infections such as trichomonas, chlamydia and gonorrhoea have been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, although only when there is evidence of a maternal immune response in some instances (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review examines the role of prophylactic antibiotics given to women in preterm labour with intact membranes. The use of antibiotics for treatment of preterm rupture of membranes is addressed in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The analysis in this review involves multiple pregnancies, therefore, wherever possible, analyses should be adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>). Treating babies from multiple pregnancies as if they are independent, when they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies, will overestimate the sample size and give confidence intervals that are too narrow. Each woman can be considered a cluster in multiple pregnancy, with the number of individuals in the cluster being equal to the number of fetuses in her pregnancy. Analysis using cluster trial methods allows calculation of relative risk and adjustment of confidence \intervals. Usually this will mean that the confidence intervals get wider. Although this may make little difference to the conclusion of a trial, it avoids misleading results in those trials where the difference may be substantial.<BR/>
<BR/>We planned to adjust for clustering in the analyses, wherever possible, and to use the inverse variance method for adjusted analyses, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). However, due to insufficient information in the included trials, we were not able to adjust our analyses. In future updates, if possible, we will adjust for clustering in the analyses. The largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK>, reported only one neonatal outcome in a multiple pregnancy (the worst outcome) where more than one outcome was found. The other three trials that enrolled women with a multiple pregnancy reported outcomes for each infant and were incorporated as such into the meta-analysis.</P>

<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this review, but we may include trials of this type in future updates. If we do, we plan to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Ccohrane Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition in the 'Risk of bias' table. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If clinical heterogeneity was evident sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study population</HEADING>
<P>All included studies used similar definitions of preterm labour, which included the presence of uterine contractions and cervical dilatation. As there is no accurate clinical test for the diagnosis of preterm labour this diagnosis relies on a clinical decision which is non-specific; the majority of women in the included studies went on to deliver at term. All studies excluded women with symptoms or signs suggestive of overt clinical infection of the mother or fetus. Gestational ages were similar in all trials with a mean gestational age at entry of 30 to 32 weeks. Two trials <LINK REF="STD-Oyarzun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oyarzun 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> recruited participants between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation. <LINK REF="STD-Reimer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 1999</LINK> did not report on a specific gestational age at recruitment.

The follow-up included infants from the initial study who were born to mothers enrolled in the UK, representing 50% of all infants enrolled and 71% of all UK infants. The primary outcome was defined as the presence of any level of functional impairment and secondary outcomes included a range of medical and behavioural outcomes. Educational attainment at seven years was assessed for children attending school in England using results from National Curriculum tests at Key Stage 1. The following outcomes from this follow-up study have been included in the review: infant death (deaths of liveborn infants to 12 months of age); functional impairment (any i.e. severe, moderate or mild combined; and moderate and severe combined) and cerebral palsy (CP) measured using proxy information provided by parents through a postal questionnaire (or by telephone in a small number) using validated tools. Clinical assessment was not feasible due to the numbers of children involved. Functional impairment was obtained using the Health Utilities Index (HUI) <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 1994</LINK> from which the Multi-Attribute Health Status (MAHS) was derived. The proportion of missing data (of those eligible for follow-up) for these included outcomes are as follows: infant death (to 12 months of age (Nil); at seven years of age, any functional impairment and moderate or severe functional impairment and cerebral palsy (71%). The investigators assessed the characteristics of the responders to the questionnaires and found that they were &#8220;broadly similar to the total population enrolled&#8221; in the ORACLE II trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-10-31 13:52:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>The trials in this review overall were of reasonably sound methodology, the populations studied were homogeneous, and the results were generally consistent across the trials. The pooled analyses of the 14 trials included in this review were dominated by the results of the ORACLE II trial <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK>. This trial differed from the majority of the trials in that (i) it was one of only three trials in which the antibiotics were used orally rather than intravenously, and (ii) it was one of only two trials which recruited women after 34 weeks' gestation. For these two reasons, it is possible therefore that <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> participants may have been less likely to demonstrate a beneficial effect from antibiotics (such as meaningful prolongation of pregnancy), but for almost all short-term outcomes, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> are consistent with those of the other trials combined.</P>
<P>While the interval between randomisation and birth was longer for women allocated to any prophylactic antibiotics versus no antibiotics, no benefit was shown in other measures of pregnancy prolongation or clinically important short-term outcomes for the infant. Consistent with these findings, no benefit was shown in subgroup analyses by type of antibiotic versus placebo or any erythromycin versus no erythromycin or any beta-lactam antibiotics versus no beta-lactams. The review identified some evidence of harm in short- and long-term infant/child outcomes associated with antibiotic exposure.</P>
<P>An increase in neonatal deaths was shown comparing any antibiotic with placebo and also when comparing any macrolide to no macrolide (erythromycin) and any co-amoxiclav with no co-amoxiclav. The number need to treat to harm (NNTH) statistic indicates that on average 149, 139, and 143 infants respectively exposed to antibiotics would result in one additional neonatal death (although confidence intervals (CIs) were wide, ranging from 61 to 2500 across these comparisons). Follow-up data at seven years of age from the UK children whose mothers joined the ORACLE II trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK>) showed the prescription of any macrolide antibiotic (erythromycin) was associated with an increase in functional impairment; the NNTH statistic showed that (on average) 34 infants (95% CI 24 to 63) being exposed to antibiotics would result in one additional child with functional impairment. The risk of cerebral palsy (CP) was also increased by exposure to either any erythromycin versus none, or any co-amoxiclav (beta-lactum) versus none, and also when used in combination versus placebo, although the overall risk was low. The average number exposed to antibiotics to cause one additional case of CP was 64, 79 and 35 respectively with wide 95% CIs ranging from 9 to 909 across these comparisons.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis of antibiotics active against anaerobic bacteria including three studies [<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1991</LINK> (using clindamycin); <LINK REF="STD-Norman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Norman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Svare-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Svare 1997</LINK> (both using a combination of ampicillin and metronidazole)], showed a statistically significant increase in the number of days from enrolment into the trial to birth of 11 days on average (95% CI 5 to 16). Anaerobic bacteria and the anaerobes of bacterial vaginosis (especially the Bacteroides species) have been associated with preterm labour, and it may be that antibiotics with anti-anaerobic activity are more effective in delaying birth. It should be noted, however, that this delay was not shown to confer benefit in terms of clinically important neonatal or longer-term outcomes.</P>
<P>The long-term outcome data in this review came from the well-conducted ORACLE II trial (The ORACLE Children Study - OCS) <LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2008b</LINK>. The results were derived from infants born to mothers enrolled in the UK representing 71% of the total UK study population. The authors have presented detailed analyses in support of the generalisability of the findings to the UK population <LINK REF="REF-Marlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlow 2012</LINK>. The rate of CP among the placebo group was low (1.6%) as many of the babies went on to be born at term. However, comparing the rate of CP among the study group with that reported from a Child CP register in the UK, the prevalence of CP was shown to be higher among children in the ORACLE Children Study <LINK REF="REF-Marlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlow 2012</LINK>. The investigators reported a standardised morbidity ratio in the OCS children (spontaneous preterm labour with intact membranes) of 3.12 (95% CI 2.47-3.87) <LINK REF="REF-Marlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlow 2012</LINK>. While not included in this review, no differences were reported in the OCS on educational attainment at seven years across the ORACLE II study groups.</P>
<P>The outcome of CP and functional impairment was largely determined by parental questionnaire and, while not as robust as clinical assessment, the primary outcome, and some of the secondary outcomes, were obtained using a validated tools <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 1994</LINK> . While chance cannot be ruled out completely, it would not be wise to dismiss this finding of increase CP out of hand.</P>
<P>The causal pathway for these findings is unclear. The pathways leading to human parturition are many and incompletely understood. Subclinical infection and inflammation are likely to play a role in a proportion of spontaneous preterm births, but the proportions may be lower than anticipated (evidence suggests subclinical infection rates of 13% to 22% in women with intact membranes <LINK REF="REF-Romero-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 2006</LINK>). It could be that, if an episode of preterm labour is infective in origin, maternal defences facilitated by the antibiotics may work to suppress labour but not the associated intrauterine and fetal inflammation. This continuing environment could lead to fetal brain injury. A significant proportion of women (and/or their babies) presenting in spontaneous preterm labour may not have underlying infection and therefore will not benefit from treatment with antibiotics and may even be harmed.</P>
<P>The lack of benefit from the antibiotics may be as a consequence of insufficient transplacental transfer of commonly used antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2000</LINK>) and consideration of novel routes of administration may be required (<LINK REF="REF-Keelan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keelan 2011</LINK>). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of subclinical infection remains elusive although advances are being made (<LINK REF="REF-Cobo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kayem-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayem 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 2010</LINK>). The subgroup of women with possible subclinical infection were not identified within the trials in this review.</P>
<P>Despite prolongation of pregnancy and reductions in maternal infection, the absence of benefit for any clinically important short-term neonatal outcomes and findings of an increase in neonatal death, functional impairment and CP in children at seven years old supports not giving antibiotics to women in preterm labour with intact membranes in the absence of signs of infection. Further research is required to develop sensitive markers of subclinical infection for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, as this is a group that might benefit from future novel interventions including new modalities of antibiotic therapy. Results from this review stress the importance of future trials of interventions to prevent preterm birth must include assessment of important longer-term child outcomes.</P>

<P>In this update October 2013, primary and secondary outcomes have been defined. Additional outcomes measures are included as primary outcomes. These are: serious maternal adverse outcome related to antibiotic treatment (respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, death) and a composite measure of death (fetal, neonatal, or later death up to the time of follow-up) or major long-term infant neurosensory impairment. Further, the list of outcomes measures included in subgroup analyses are now restricted to those which are considered to be most clinically important. Two additional comparisons were included: Any macrolide antibiotics versus No macrolide antibiotics; and Any beta-lactam antibiotics versus No beta-lactam antibiotics. We also removed the exclusion criterion according to attrition rates.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-10-05 15:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Methods used to assess trials included in previous versions of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-31 13:14:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vicki  J Flenady">
<P>The standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration were used as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>). Trials under consideration were evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results. The review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all potentially eligible trials and, for all included trials, independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data. Differences in interpretation were resolved by discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used for assessing trial quality:</HEADING>
<P>Six major sources of potential bias and methods of avoidance of these biases were considered when assessing trial quality as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (selection bias)</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (selection bias)</LI>
<LI>Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias)</LI>
<LI>Other bias</LI>
</OL>
<P>The quality assessment rating for bias was:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk</LI>
<LI>unclear risk</LI>
<LI>high risk</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis:</HEADING>
<P>Trial data were extracted by the two review authors independently. Missing or incomplete data were sought in all cases from the trial authors and included in the results where possible. Additional information was sought from investigators of the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 1999</LINK>) and additional information from 2 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gurbuz--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gurbuz 2004</LINK>). For further details, see table of 'Characteristics of included studies' and 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>Analyses were conducted using a fixed-effect model. However, in the overall analysis two outcomes were noted to have statistically significant heterogeneity: 'Admission to neonatal intensive care' and, 'Interval from randomisation to delivery (days)'. On visual inspection of the graph and subsequent sensitivity analyses, it appeared that the source of heterogeneity was the trials which used antibiotics active against anaerobic organisms. Based on the results of sensitivity analyses by type of antibiotic (excluding trial using antibiotics active against anaerobic antibiotics and also by random-effects versus fixed-effect models), it was decided the outcome of 'Interval from randomisation to delivery (days)' would not be combined in an overall analysis as this summary statistic would be potentially misleading. However, the outcome of 'Admission to neonatal intensive care' was included using a random-effects model as the results for this outcome were similar to that of the sensitivity analysis by type of antibiotic used.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were performed by type of antibiotic used as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>treatment with macrolide antibiotics alone;</LI>
<LI>treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics alone;</LI>
<LI>treatment with macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotics;</LI>
<LI>treatment with antibiotics active against anaerobic bacteria.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To avoid unit of analysis problems, data from the <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 2001a</LINK> (which employed a factorial design - three antibiotic arms and one placebo) were included in these subgroup analyses following an adjustment to the placebo group. In these subgroup analyses, each of the antibiotic arms from this trial were compared to the same placebo group (three comparisons). Therefore, the numerator and denominator for all reported outcomes in the placebo arm were divided by three for categorical data and for outcomes reported on a continuous scale dividing the denominators only by three. A sensitivity analysis comparing the results of the unadjusted with the adjusted analyses demonstrated only minimal differences for all reported outcomes.</P>
<P>Results are presented using relative risk (RR) for categorical data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for variables measured on a continuous scale and include 95 per cent confidence intervals (CI). Results are also expressed using number needed to treat (NNT) where appropriate.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group will conduct a further search on submission of the update. The Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of EMBASE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords. </P>
<P>In addition, a search including the electronic databases: MEDLINE (1965 to Mar 2012), using text terms: antibiotic*, preterm, prematur*, labour, labor, infection, amnionitis, chorioamnionitis. A manual search of the references of all retrieved articles will be performed. </P>
<P>No language restrictions will be applied. </P>
