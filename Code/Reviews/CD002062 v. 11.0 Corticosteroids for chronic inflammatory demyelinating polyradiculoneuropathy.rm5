<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>CIDP is an uncommon paralysing disease that occurs when nerves outside the brain and spinal cord become inflamed. It produces slowly evolving weakness and numbness of the limbs. Some people have recurrent periods of worsening followed by improvement or remission. We wanted to discover the answers to two questions: firstly, whether use of corticosteroids is helpful; and secondly, whether one type of corticosteroid treatment is better than another. This is an update of a review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) addressing each question. We did not find any new trials for this update.</P>
<P>A 1982 US study compared daily prednisone tablets for 12 weeks with no treatment. Thirty-five people took part. Fourteen participants received prednisone (10 male and four female, with a median age of 46.5 years) and 14 did not receive prednisone (nine male and five female, with a median age of 50 years). Those taking part and the trialists were aware of which treatment the participants received (i.e. they were not 'blinded'), which carries a risk of bias.</P>
<P>The second study compared two six-month corticosteroid treatment regimens: daily standard-dose prednisolone tablets, and high-dose dexamethasone tablets for four days each month. Multiple European centres did the trial, which reported its findings in 2010. Forty-one people took part but one person withdrew after one day because they did not want to continue and the diagnosis was wrong. Of those who continued, 24 (18 men and six women, average age 59.9 years) received monthly dexamethasone and 16 (10 men and six women, average age 60.8 years) received daily prednisolone.</P>
<P>There was no commercial support for either study. Funding for both came from an academic centre or charitable funds.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Neither included study reported our preferred primary outcome, which was a disability score.</P>
<P>After 12 weeks, in the trial of prednisone compared to no treatment, 12 of 19 participants on prednisone improved compared with five of 16 participants not on prednisone, based on measurement of disease severity by neurologists. Thus, improvement was about twice as common with prednisone. The small numbers in the trial and its limitations meant that even with this difference we are very uncertain about the size of any effect of prednisone. The trial authors did not report side effects in detail, but one person who received prednisone died. Corticosteroids are commonly used for CIDP in practice, based on favourable reports from non-randomised studies. Corticosteroids are well known to cause side effects, especially when people take large doses for a long time.</P>
<P>In the RCT comparing two corticosteroid regimens, 10 of 24 people on monthly dexamethasone and six of 16 people on daily prednisolone were well and off treatment after a year, which indicates effects that are probably similar. Changes in grip strength and scores of muscle strength were also probably similar between the treatment groups. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone had similar side effects to one another, except that with high-dose monthly dexamethasone, sleeplessness may be less common and a moon-shaped facial appearance is probably less common.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>The benefit and harm from prednisone in CIDP is uncertain. The quality of evidence is very low because only one small randomised trial with a high risk of bias is available.</P>
<P>Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone may be of similar benefit in CIDP, but monthly dexamethasone may have fewer side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to 8 November 2016.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-11-28 10:13:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:42:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive or relapsing and remitting paralysing illness, probably due to an autoimmune response, which should benefit from corticosteroid treatment. Non-randomised studies suggest that corticosteroids are beneficial. Two commonly used corticosteroids are prednisone and prednisolone. Both are usually given as oral tablets. Prednisone is converted into prednisolone in the liver so that the effect of the two drugs is usually the same. Another corticosteroid, dexamethasone, is more potent and is used in smaller doses. The review was first published in 2001 and last updated in 2015; we undertook this update to identify any new evidence. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:24:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>To assess the effects of corticosteroid treatment for CIDP compared to placebo or no treatment, and to compare the effects of different corticosteroid regimens.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:24:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 8 November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised trials of corticosteroids for CIDP. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:24:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of treatment with any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone for CIDP, diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:43:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two authors extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias independently. The intended primary outcome was change in disability, with change in impairment after 12 weeks and side effects as secondary outcomes. We assessed strength of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-28 10:13:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>One non-blinded RCT comparing prednisone with no treatment in 35 eligible participants did not measure the primary outcome for this systematic review. The trial had a high risk of bias. Neuropathy Impairment Scale scores after 12 weeks improved in 12 of 19 participants randomised to prednisone, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) for improvement 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52; very low-quality evidence). The trial did not report side effects in detail, but one prednisone-treated participant died.</P>
<P>A double-blind RCT comparing daily standard-dose oral prednisolone with monthly high-dose oral dexamethasone in 40 participants reported none of the prespecified outcomes for this review. The trial had a low risk of bias, but the quality of evidence was limited as it came from a single small study. There was little or no difference in number of participants who achieved remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone; moderate-quality evidence), or change in disability or impairment after one year (low-quality evidence). Change of grip strength or Medical Research Council (MRC) scores demonstrated little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality to low-quality evidence). Eight of 16 people in the prednisolone group and seven of 24 people in the dexamethasone group deteriorated. Side effects were similar with each regimen, except that sleeplessness was less common with monthly dexamethasone (low-quality evidence) as was moon facies (moon-shaped appearance of the face) (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:25:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We are very uncertain about the effects of oral prednisone compared with no treatment, because the quality of evidence from the only RCT that exists is very low. Nevertheless, corticosteroids are commonly used in practice, supported by very low-quality evidence from observational studies. We also know from observational studies that corticosteroids carry the long-term risk of serious side effects. The efficacy of high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone is probably little different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone. Most side effects occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone moon facies is probably less common and sleeplessness may be less common than with oral prednisolone. We need further research to identify factors that predict response.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:25:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:25:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is characterised by chronic progressive or relapsing weakness and numbness, especially of the limbs. It affects motor and sensory nerve fibres, but may present with predominantly motor or sensory symptoms. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration is usually increased. The aetiology of CIDP is presumed to be autoimmune (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathey-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>). Biopsy and autopsy studies of active lesions in the peripheral nerves and spinal roots show oedema, lymphocytic infiltration, and macrophage-associated segmental demyelination. </P>
<P>The disease is uncommon. It affects males and females of all ages but is more common in the elderly. Estimates of prevalence range from 2 to 9 per 100,000. Prevalences of 2.84 per 100,000 in England (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2014</LINK>) and 3.58 per 100,000 in North Italy are typical (<LINK REF="REF-Chi_x00f2_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiò 2007</LINK>). In the English study, 32% of people with CIDP required aid to walk on the prevalence date.</P>
<P>Early, large case series described the clinical picture, but did not precisely define the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1976</LINK>). Research criteria for the diagnosis were proposed by the Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease (AIDS) Task Force (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1991</LINK>). These required fulfilment of clinical and electrophysiological criteria for a diagnosis of "probable" CIDP, and fulfilment of pathological criteria for a diagnosis of "definite" CIDP in which the progressive phase lasted more than eight weeks. These criteria have been extensively debated. More liberal criteria have been widely adopted, including in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Bergh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Bergh 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>In this review we relied on the authors' diagnosis of CIDP provided that it fulfilled the spirit of the definition of &#8220;probable&#8221; CIDP proposed by the Ad Hoc Subcommittee (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1991</LINK>). Apart from the neurophysiological evidence of multifocal demyelination, there are no reliable diagnostic tests for CIDP, and the diagnosis is, in part, one of exclusion. Differential diagnoses include hereditary, metabolic, vasculitic, amyloid, paraneoplastic, and paraproteinaemic neuropathies. There is a debate about whether some cases of neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and monoclonal gammopathy are due to CIDP. Because of the uncertainty, we planned to exclude such cases from this review. We also excluded multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, which is generally recognised to be a separate entity and does not respond to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Schaik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Schaik 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:25:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Treatments for CIDP are aimed at suppressing an abnormal autoimmune response. Corticosteroids are potent immunosuppressants. Two commonly used corticosteroids are prednisone and prednisolone. Both are usually given as oral tablets. Prednisone is converted into prednisolone in the liver so that the effect of the two drugs is usually the same. Another corticosteroid, called dexamethasone, is more potent and is used in smaller doses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1958</LINK> reported dramatic improvement with corticosteroids and relapse following withdrawal, even when the withdrawal was done under blind conditions. From then onwards, corticosteroids were extensively used for CIDP, although only one randomised trial comparing corticosteroids with controls was ever done (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1982</LINK>). Subsequently, large retrospective studies on CIDP reported significant improvement after corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuwabara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuwabara 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>). The usual regimen has been long-term oral prednisone or prednisolone, with the dose titrated according to the individual&#8217;s response. Alternative regimens of pulsed high-dose intravenous or oral corticosteroids have been tried, and pulsed high-dose oral dexamethasone has been compared with standard-dose oral prednisolone in the <LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Although corticosteroids were the first treatment to be used in CIDP, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have since been used in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and shown in Cochrane reviews to be efficacious short-term treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehndiratta-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehndiratta 2015</LINK>). Limited studies have suggested that plasma exchange is not significantly different from IVIg in efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1994</LINK>), and that IVIg is not significantly different from oral prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>). A six-month trial found no significant difference in the outcomes between IVIg and intravenous methylprednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>). These two trials are included in the Cochrane review of IVIg for CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>). Many different immunosuppressive agents have been tried and reported in case studies and case series; azathioprine, methotrexate, and beta-interferon have been tested in small RCTs, but none have been shown to be efficacious (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Corticosteroids are widely used in medicine as anti-inflammatory agents. They are lipid soluble so that they can easily cross the cell membrane and engage the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm. The corticosteroid-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus and modifies the transcription of genes, resulting in inhibition of inflammatory mediator release, increase of anti-inflammatory molecules and reduction of circulating T-lymphocytes. In high doses there are also more rapidly acting non-genomic effects on membrane lipids and cytoplasmic proteins which also have an anti-inflammatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Strehl-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehl 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:25:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In view of the lack of evidence of efficacy for cytotoxic and immunomodulatory drugs in CIDP, and the expense and inconvenience of IVIg and plasma exchange, it is important to know the strength of the evidence for corticosteroids, which are commonly recommended as first line treatment.

An electrophysiological diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathy based on reduced nerve conduction velocities or partial conduction blocks must have confirmed the clinical diagnosis. The diagnosis might have been confirmed by finding a raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein or the demonstration of inflammation and macrophage-associated demyelination in a nerve biopsy, but we did not consider these mandatory. We excluded participants with clinical features or investigations suggestive of hereditary neuropathy, relevant systemic disease, or paraproteinaemia.</P>

The trial recruited 40 participants over 58 months, and assigned them alternately to prednisone or no treatment. Five participants were removed (three in the treated group, and two from the control group) because of misdiagnosis. A further seven (five in the treatment group, and two in the control group) did not complete the study. Of the five assigned to prednisone and excluded, one died from cardiac arrhythmia, possibly related to hyperglycaemia, three had their prednisone dosage altered from that allowed by the schedule, and one remained dependent on a respirator and did not complete follow-up. Two participants in the control group worsened and were started on prednisone by their referring physicians because of deterioration in their neurological status. Of the 28 participants completing the trial, 14 participants belonged to each group (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>
<I>)</I>. The treatment group started on prednisone at a dosage of 120 mg every other day, tapered to 0 mg by the end of 12 weeks. The participants in the two groups were well matched for age, sex, initial neurology disability score, muscle strength, cutaneous sensation, nerve conduction values, and CSF protein.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of oral prednisone with no treatment</HEADING>
<P>Data for our primary outcome measure, change in disability, were not available for this comparison, but the trial provided data for our secondary outcome measure, change in impairment after three months. In their own analysis, the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1982</LINK> omitted seven participants who breached their protocol, and reported the results for the remainder. The median score at baseline was 74 NIS points in both groups, with the lowest values being 28, and the highest 137. A healthy person would score zero, with higher values indicating more impairment, with the worst possible score being 280 (the scale is non-linear). After 12 weeks, there was a median deterioration in the NIS score of 1.5 points in the untreated group and an improvement in the prednisone group of 10 points, giving a significant result (P = 0.016) (data directly from paper). We were concerned that omission of the seven participants biased the results in favour of prednisone treatment. We repeated their calculations, including the participants who breached protocol and had been excluded, so as to perform a true intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. When we imputed the worst value for each group for the missing values, the results still favoured prednisone treatment (median increase (worsening) of two points in the control, and decrease (improvement) of five points in the prednisone group), but the difference was not statistically significant. We also calculated the mean improvement in impairment and 95% CI when the seven withdrawn participants were excluded, leaving 28 participants (MD 17.14, 95% CI -4.39 to 38.67), or when they were included with the assumption that they had not improved (MD 11.60, 95% CI -9.39 to 32.58) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Although both effect estimates suggested that prednisone may be of clinical benefit, we consider the effects uncertain because vulnerable to the effects of missing data, other risks of bias, and imprecision, with wide CI that encompassed benefit and potential harm; the evidence was very low quality.</P>
<P>An alternative method of looking at this outcome, albeit not one which we had stipulated in our protocol, was to compare the proportions of participants who had improved, stayed the same, or worsened after 12 weeks. When this analysis was done omitting the seven participants who breached protocol (i.e. in 28 participants), five participants showed spontaneous improvement, one remained the same, and eight worsened in the control group. On the other hand, in the treatment group, 12 participants improved from their initial impairment score, while two worsened. These proportions favoured prednisone (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.00; very low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). When we repeated this analysis on all 35 participants, categorising the seven who were withdrawn as not having improved, the result still favoured prednisone, but the effect was slightly smaller and the lower CI encompassed the possibility of no effect; the RR for improvement was 2.02 (95% CI 0.90 to 4.52; very low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Other measures of impairment reported by the investigators in the 28 participants who were followed up: touch-pressure threshold on the hand (P = 0.017) and grip strength (P = 0.046), showed significantly more improvement in the prednisone-treated group than the untreated group. These measures were not available for those who were withdrawn and so an ITT analysis was not possible.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK> did not report the outcomes preselected for this review, but did report meaningful outcomes. The primary outcome defined by the trial authors was reaching and remaining in remission without treatment at 12 months. Remission was defined as a minimum of three points improvement on the RMI and minimum of one point improvement in the INCAT disability scale. If a participant did not show improvement or disease stabilisation compared with baseline at eight weeks, or relapsed or had serious side effects, trial treatment was stopped and this was considered a treatment failure.</P>
<P>Forty-one people were randomly assigned. After one day of trial assignment, one person, who had not by then received any treatment, withdrew because of rapid progression in disease and change in diagnosis. Twenty-four participants were assigned to dexamethasone and 16 to prednisolone. The dexamethasone and prednisolone groups were well matched at baseline. Eighteen men and six women were randomised to dexamethasone and 10 men and six women to prednisolone. The mean (range) age was 59.9 (25.8 to 80.2) years in the dexamethasone group and 60.8 (25.3 to 87.7) years in the prednisolone group. The mean (interquartile range) disease duration was 13.5 (5.3 to 28.5) months in the dexamethasone group and 8.5 (6.0 to 15.0) months in the prednisolone group.</P>
<P>In the analysis of the trial authors' primary outcome, 10 out of 24 in the dexamethasone group and six out of 16 in the prednisolone group achieved remission at the end of one year, a difference slightly in favour of dexamethasone, but with wide CI that included the possibility of clinically relevant differences in either direction (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45; moderate-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Seven of 24 participants in the dexamethasone and eight of 16 participants in the prednisolone group deteriorated. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes measured by the authors, including change at endpoint in MRC sum score (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; low-quality evidence), grip strength (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; moderate-quality evidence), disability scale, INCAT sensory sum score (low-quality evidence), or Short Form-36 Health Survey quality of life scores. The endpoint was 12 months or premature cessation of treatment if after eight weeks if there had been worsening or no stabilisation, or if there was a relapse back to baseline state, or if there were serious side-effects due to the drug. There was a suggestion that improvement was faster in the dexamethasone treated group; median time to remission was 20 weeks (95% CI 12.4 to 27.6) in the dexamethasone group in comparison to 39 weeks (95% CI 29.9 to 48.1) in the prednisolone group (P = 0.057). Median time to improvement by one point in the INCAT disability scale was 17 weeks (95% CI 13.8 to 20.2) in the dexamethasone group and 39 weeks (29.9 to 48.1) in the prednisolone group (P = 0.036).</P>
<P>Side effects, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and osteopenia, were comparably common in both groups, with the exception of sleeplessness and cushingoid facies, which were more common in the daily prednisolone group (RR 0.44, 0.24 to 0.84 and RR 0.50, 0.21 to 1.17, respectively; low- and moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Severe weight gain (&gt; 3 kg) was more common with daily prednisolone than with dexamathasone (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.84) but weight gain of 1 kg to 3 kg was not, although this result was somewhat imprecise (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.70) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of the main results and quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1982</LINK> trial comparing prednisone for 12 weeks with no treatment was a pioneering study in the field of inflammatory neuropathy. By modern standards the trial had a high risk of bias because of failure to conceal allocation, absence of blinding, and lack of ITT analysis. Additionally, the sample size was small, the outcome measures non-linear and compound, and the result imprecise. The trial authors concluded that corticosteroids significantly reduced impairment and improved measures of nerve conduction. There was no information concerning disability, our preferred primary outcome measure. When we imputed pessimistic values for the participants who were withdrawn and re-analysed, the results for one of our secondary outcome measures, improvement in impairment 12 weeks after randomisation, favoured corticosteroids, but the quality of evidence was very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The interpretation of the results of the trial is critically dependent on how the withdrawn participants are analysed. One withdrawn prednisone participant died and another remained ventilated, which favours no prednisone. Two withdrawn control participants worsened and then improved on prednisone, which favours prednisone. In the study authors' own analysis, excluding the seven participants who breached protocol, there was significant improvement in measures of sensory threshold, grip strength and nerve conduction. The absence of a true ITT analysis seriously weakens the strength of the evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>There have been no trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo in CIDP. Since there is so little evidence from randomised studies, we also considered large series in which the use of corticosteroids has been reported. In 1958, Austin described recurrent steroid-responsiveness in two people and reviewed nine others (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1958</LINK>). In one, Austin demonstrated steroid-responsiveness through documentation of 20 recurrences over a five-year period compared with significant progression following oral, intramuscular, and intravenous placebo administration. Others reported benefit from corticosteroids in single cases or small case series (<LINK REF="REF-DeVivo-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeVivo 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 1981</LINK> reported 25 people with CIDP treated with corticosteroids alone in an observational study in which "the majority" improved. The study authors emphasised that a lag period, usually of one to four weeks, but occasionally up to five months, occurred from onset of therapy to the first sign of improvement. They recommended high doses of steroids for about one year, then cautious tapering to avoid pharmacorelapses, and long-term, low, maintenance doses to prevent spontaneous relapses. Beneficial effects of corticosteroids have also been documented in children with CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Hattori-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hattori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nevo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sladky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sladky 1986</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK> reported a study of 92 cases of all ages. Sixty (65%) participants had a relapsing course and 32 participants (35%) a progressive or monophasic course. Seventy-six participants were treated with corticosteroids. Forty-nine participants (65%) made a good recovery and were independent. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK> studied 60 people aged 10 to 77 years. A consistent approach to treatment was used over the decade of observation. Participants were started on a regimen of 100 mg of prednisone daily for two to four weeks and then switched to prednisone 100 mg in a single dose on alternate days. This regimen was continued until clinical improvement plateaued. If the participant's response was poor or a relapse occurred, either azathioprine or plasma exchange was added to the treatment. Fifty-six (94.9%) of 59 treated participants showed initial improvement with immunosuppressive treatment. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) time for improvement was 1.9 (3.6) months. The mean time to reach a clinical plateau was 6.6 (5.4) months. In an abstract, <LINK REF="REF-Machkhas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machkhas 1997</LINK> reported benefit from pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for five days and then 1000 mg daily every one to four weeks in five people with CIDP. Side effects were not reported. <LINK REF="REF-Sabatelli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabatelli 2001</LINK> reported that four people with pure motor CIDP did not respond to prednisolone but all four responded to IVIg. Particularly helpful is the detailed, albeit retrospective, Italian national study which included 136 people with CIDP treated with corticosteroids as first line therapy, of whom 51% responded with a one or more point improvement in the Rankin score and 19 of whom (12.5%) had side effects (five people with diabetes mellitus, four with hypertension, three with osteoporosis, three with duodenal ulcer, two with psychosis, and one with obesity) (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2010</LINK>). Fourteen participants who had previously been treated with IVIg were switched to corticosteroids, and six (43%) responded. This large systematic national survey suggests that corticosteroids induce at least short-term improvement in about half of people with CIDP, less than the 65% or more suggested by smaller case series studies from single centres. It also documents the improvement of some people on corticosteroids after switching from IVIg, which has been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Care must be exercised in starting treatment because some people with CIDP deteriorate, as reported in case series (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostasy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostasy 2003</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK>. In a post hoc analysis of <LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK>, seven of 33 participants deteriorated within eight weeks after start of treatment, four patients had received dexamethasone and three had received prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no known method for identifying people with CIDP who will deteriorate. Deterioration has been considered more likely in pure motor CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Donaghy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaghy 1994</LINK>), but also occurs in pure sensory CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Chroni-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chroni 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajabally-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajabally 2012</LINK>). The likelihood of response to steroids in various atypical forms of CIDP is also uncertain. A retrospective review of published accounts of multifocal asymmetric upper limb-onset CIDP found that 52% of people (14 of 27) treated with steroids improved compared to 74% (31 of 42) of those treated with IVIg. The same review found that people with multifocal asymmetric lower limb-onset forms were significantly less likely to respond to steroids than IVIg (2 of 8 (25%) versus 14 of 16 (87%)) (<LINK REF="REF-Rajabally-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajabally 2009</LINK>). According to a retrospective study of seven people with corticosteroid-responsive disease and seven who were non-responsive to corticosteroid, corticosteroid response was significantly more likely in those with smaller sensory action potentials and longer upper limb F wave latencies (<LINK REF="REF-Rajabally-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajabally 2008</LINK>). In a retrospective study of 50 people with CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2006</LINK>), there was no difference in responsiveness to any immunotherapy (including IVIg, as well as corticosteroids) between 27 people with neurophysiologically definite and 23 people with neurophysiologically probable CIDP, classified according to the INCAT criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>). Five out of seven people with early deterioration had a focal distribution pattern of demyelination, compared to only five out of 26 people without early deterioration (P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2014</LINK>). This observation suggests that a focal pattern of demyelination might predict worsening after starting corticosteroids. but this requires confirmation in new prospective studies. The mechanism by which corticosteroids can cause worsening is not known. <LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2014</LINK> speculated that corticosteroids might upregulate the axonal Na+K+ pump, causing hyperpolarisation and conduction block, especially in motor nerve fibres.</P>
<P>The issue of side effects is very important in deciding whether to use corticosteroids as the first line treatment for CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 2004</LINK>). Side effects include weight gain, hirsutism, cushingoid or moon facies, susceptibility to overwhelming infection, osteoporosis, hip fracture, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cataracts, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and psychiatric manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1996</LINK>), many of which have been reported in the case series studies described in the discussion above. Many of these effects are not adequately captured in short-term trials, even those with follow-up for one year, but are relevant when considering the value of long-term treatment.</P>
<P>Cost is another important consideration. Oral prednisone or prednisolone are cheap to purchase but monitoring for the known side effects incurs costs, and the long-term costs of serious side effects are substantial. However, even when these are taken into account, corticosteroids are much less expensive than the main alternative, IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Blackhouse-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackhouse 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCrone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrone 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison of different corticosteroid regimens</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of the main results and quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>One trial compared a commonly-used regimen of standard-dose daily oral prednisolone with monthly, high-dose, oral dexamethasone (<LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK>). There was probably little or no difference between regimens in the primary outcome chosen by the trial authors (remission after 12 months). Monthly dexamethasone produced a more rapid one point INCAT improvement than oral prednisolone, which reached statistical significance. Unexpectedly, one-third of the participants deteriorated, slightly but not significantly more in the daily prednisolone group. Minor side effects were common, and sleeplessness (low-quality evidence) and cushingoid facies (moderate-quality evidence) were more common in the prednisolone group. Weight gain of more than 3 kg was more common in the prednisolone group both during treatment and follow-up periods. The trial had a low risk of bias. The limitations of this evidence, which we judged to be of low to moderate quality for efficacy, are that there was only one trial, the sample size was smaller than intended because of the slow recruitment rate, and some measures were imprecise and also to an extent indirect (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial included an informal follow-up after a median 4.5 years when data were available from 39 of 40 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2012</LINK>). Cure (off treatment &gt; five years) or remission (off treatment &gt; five years) occurred in seven out of 24 participants initially treated with pulsed dexamethasone and six out of 16 participants initially treated with prednisolone. Half those in remission after initial treatment relapsed. The median treatment-free interval was longer, 17.5 months, for pulsed dexamethasone than for conventional dose prednisolone (11 months), which was not a clear difference. Unfortunately, the different treatments received after the end of the one-year trial confounded these comparisons. Importantly, the diagnosis turned out to be wrong in seven participants, who accounted for more than half of the 12 who did not respond to any treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>There have been many case reports, case series studies, and reviews describing widely varying types, doses and routes of corticosteroid usage in CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 2004</LINK>), but no other RCTs. <LINK REF="STD-PREDICT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">PREDICT 2010</LINK> was based on an observational study of six cycles of oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily for four days every four weeks, in which six of ten participants went into remission (<LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 1997</LINK>). A retrospective observational study of 39 participants (out of 57 with available records), included 16 participants who received intermittent intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for three to five days and then 1000 mg monthly, seven who received IVIg, and 16 people who received oral treatment consisting of either prednisone (in 12) or ciclosporin (in four) (<LINK REF="STD-Lopate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lopate 2005</LINK>). After six months, the average improvement in muscle strength was similar in all three groups. Cushingoid appearance and weight gain were more common in those who received oral prednisone. <LINK REF="REF-Kuwabara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuwabara 2006</LINK> treated 38 people with CIDP of whom 33 received high-dose corticosteroids as their first treatment: of these 33, 70% improved by one or more points on the seven-point GBS disability grade scale by two months. Some people were subsequently treated with IVIg or plasma exchange so that their five-year status cannot be attributed solely to corticosteroids, but 26% were in complete remission off treatment, 29% were still being treated with corticosteroids, 10% needed aid to walk, and one had died of complications associated with tetraplegia. Side effects were not mentioned. In another retrospective observational study, <LINK REF="REF-Muley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muley 2008</LINK> treated 10 people with oral methylprednisolone 500 mg once a week for three months, and the dose was adjusted every three months by 50 mg to 100 mg depending on clinical status. One person stopped treatment after two days because of duodenal ulceration, but six of the remaining nine entered and maintained treatment-free remission after a mean of 27 (SD 7.04) months. Long-term skin thinning and cushingoid facies were each reported in three people, and five people developed osteoporosis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Boru-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boru 2014</LINK> treated 20 people with CIDP with intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day for 10 days and then 1000 mg monthly for five years. Five people were not followed up, one because of lack of response, another because of nausea and hypertension, and three for reasons unrelated to the study. The remaining 15 all improved compared with baseline by at least one point on the modified Rankin score at the first and fifth year. After five years, treatment was stopped and during a five further years' follow-up, six participants relapsed. All those relapsing received intravenous methylprednisolone again and three responded. Side-effects occurred in nearly half the participants, including weight gain in six, but no other participants had to stop treatment.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for this review did not allow us to consider RCTs comparing corticosteroids with IVIg or other treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>). These have been considered in the <LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK> Cochrane review and the <LINK REF="REF-Oaklander-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oaklander 2017</LINK> Cochrane overview.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison of corticosteroids with no treatment and comparison of different corticosteroid regimens</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>For both the comparisons included in this review, we are confident that we have identified all RCTs comparing corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment and comparing different corticosteroid regimens. However, the exclusion of comparisons with other treatments especially IVIg is a limitation which has been corrected by their inclusion in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oaklander-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oaklander 2017</LINK>). We also recognise that it is not possible to identify all the non-randomised evidence. Our review of published case series may not be complete, and will have been limited by the impossibility of including all treated and untreated people with CIDP. Of concern is that one of the RCTs identified only considered 12 weeks of treatment, and the other only 12 months, whereas in practice, people with CIDP may require treatment for years. Longer RCTs of corticosteroids are unlikely to be done.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>There have been no other systematic reviews. The conclusions of this review are in line with the assessment of the evidence by an international expert panel (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Bergh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Bergh 2010</LINK>). A more recent non-systematic review including the comparison of corticosteroids with IVIg supports the use of pulsed high-dose corticosteroids rather than IVIg as the first treatment choice in people with non-motor-dominant CIDP who are not extremely disabled (<LINK REF="REF-Press-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 2016</LINK>). Two other Cochrane reviews consider the comparison of corticosteroids with IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oaklander-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oaklander 2017</LINK>).</P>

<P>We are very uncertain about the effects of prednisone in comparison to no treatment in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy as the quality of evidence is very low. Nevertheless, corticosteroids are commonly used in practice, supported by very low-quality evidence from observational studies and apparent clinical efficacy in day-to-day use. Corticosteroids are known from observational studies to carry the long-term risk of serious side effects. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone probably has similar efficacy to daily oral prednisolone. Both cause short-term side effects, but sleeplessness may be less common and moon facies is probably less common with monthly dexamethasone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-24 10:27:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Further research is needed to identify factors which predict response and deterioration after corticosteroids. Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to discover whether corticosteroids are cost effective compared with other treatments, especially intravenous immunoglobulin, and whether adjunctive treatment with immunosuppressive agents is superior to corticosteroids alone.</P>

<P>The trial pharmacist, who had no further role in the study, randomised each participant on inclusion, and treatment allocation was performed in a 1:1 ratio by use of a random number generator. A minimisation procedure was used for age (&lt; 50 and &#8805; 50 years). Dexamethasone, prednisolone, and placebo came in identical capsules. After randomisation, the pharmacist delivered trial drugs in identical white blister packs with the participant&#8217;s identification number, week number, and day number on the outside to the trial nurse, who was masked to treatment allocation. This process ensured concealment of treatment before allocation. The trial nurse sent the drugs to the various centres by courier.
