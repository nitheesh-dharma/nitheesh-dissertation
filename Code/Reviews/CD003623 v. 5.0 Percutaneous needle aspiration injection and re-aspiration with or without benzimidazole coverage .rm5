<P>Following a primary review of literature, the authors found out that the PAIR method was usually performed with concomitant benzimidazole coverage; ie, albendazole, mebendazole, or any other drugs of the benzimidazole group. Therefore, in order to better reflect the substance of the review, the protocol title 'Percutaneous needle aspiration with or without oral albendazole for uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts' was changed into 'Percutaneous needle aspiration, injection, and reaspiration with or without benzimidazole coverage for uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts' (03/07/2003).</P>

<P>Two randomised clinical trials on the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration method for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst were identified. One trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration with surgical treatment. The other trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration with or without albendazole with albendazole alone. Both trials had high risk of bias. The number of participants enrolled and the follow-up duration are insufficient for a definite conclusion to be drawn. In general, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration method with or without benzimidazole coverage for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst.</P>

<P>Hepatic hydatid cyst is an important public health problem in parts of the world where dogs are used for cattle breeding. Management of uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts is currently surgical. However, the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration (PAIR) method with or without benzimidazole coverage has appeared as an alternative over the past decade.</P>

<P>Only randomised clinical trials using the PAIR method with or without benzimidazole coverage as the experimental treatment of uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst (ie, hepatic hydatid cysts, which are not infected and do not have any communication with the biliary tree or other viscera) versus no intervention, sham puncture (ie, performing all steps for puncture, pretending PAIR being performed, but actually not performing the procedure), surgery, or chemotherapy were included.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:57:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We found no randomised clinical trials comparing PAIR versus no or sham intervention. We identified only two randomised clinical trials, one comparing PAIR versus surgical treatment (n = 50 participants) and the other comparing PAIR (with or without albendazole) versus albendazole alone (n = 30 participants). Both trials were graded as 'adequate' for allocation concealment; however, generation of allocation sequence and blinding methods were 'unclear' in both. Compared to surgery, PAIR plus albendazole obtained similar cyst disappearance and mean cyst diameter with fewer adverse events (32% versus 84%, P &lt; 0.001) and fewer days in hospital (mean <U>+</U> SD) ( 4.2 + 1.5 versus 12.7 + 6.5 days, P &lt; 0.001). Compared to albendazole, PAIR with or without albendazole obtained significantly more (P &lt; 0.01) cyst reduction and symptomatic relief.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-06 15:00:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hydatid cyst disease, or cystic echinococcosis is a near-cosmopolitan zoonosis caused by larval forms of the cestode <I>Echinococcus granulosus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Pawlowski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawlowski 1997</LINK>). Humans are incidental intermediate hosts of the parasite, and the liver is the most common site of involvement (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 2003</LINK>). The disease may remain silent for many years before coming into medical attention as an incidental imaging finding, or it may present with complications (<LINK REF="REF-Frider-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frider 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK>). Management of uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts is currently surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>), although percutaneous aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration (PAIR) has emerged as a potential first line treatment.</P>
<P>Various surgical methods are in use with variable outcomes, but the most common technique is total or partial cystectomy. Surgery is associated with considerable mortality, morbidity, and recurrence rate, is expensive, and needs expertise (<LINK REF="REF-Magistrelli-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magistrelli 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safioleas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safioleas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medeiros-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medeiros 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safioleas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safioleas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagholikar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagholikar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nari--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nari 2003</LINK>). Medical treatment with benzimidazoles (albendazole or mebendazole) has been used for the treatment of patients not fit for surgery or as an adjunct to surgery. However, few controlled data are available regarding its claimed clinical efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Keshmiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keshmiri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_On-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-On 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horton 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For many years, percutaneous aspiration of hydatid cyst was discouraged because of the potential risk of spillage and anaphylactic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Schiller-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiller 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saidi-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saidi 1976</LINK>). However, unintended or deliberated cases of cyst puncture showed no significant complications (<LINK REF="REF-Fornage-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fornage 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCorkell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCorkell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Livraghi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livraghi 1985</LINK>). The so-called PAIR method was then introduced accidentally by Mueller in 1985 (<LINK REF="STD-Mueller-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mueller 1985</LINK>) and later on reported in case series with variable outcomes, most of the series authors claiming the technique was safe and effective (<LINK REF="REF-Ben-Amor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben Amor 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bret-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bret 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acunas-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Acunas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bastid-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bastid 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akhan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Akhan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Men-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Men 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelaez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pelaez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ormeci-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ormeci 2001</LINK>). PAIR is performed under ultrasound (US) guidance (or sometimes computed tomography (CT) guidance) and includes drainage of the cysts with a fine needle or catheter, followed by instillation of protoscolicidal substances (eg, hypertonic saline or absolute alcohol) and re-aspiration. Prophylaxis with benzimidazoles may be used before and after the procedure. If the cyst communicates with the biliary tree, injection of scolicidal agents carries an almost universal risk of sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, PAIR is contraindicated in a cyst communicating with the biliary tree (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002d_IWGE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO-IWGE 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite its claimed safety and efficacy, PAIR is not yet accepted as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoianov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stoianov 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaghan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaghan 2004</LINK>). We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the topic based on randomised clinical trials. This systematic review was carried out to assess the available evidence on safety and efficacy of PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage for treating patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts.</P>

<P>We performed the review and meta-analyses following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) and The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2010</LINK>). The analyses were performed using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Application of inclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We assessed titles of research articles retrieved from the electronic database and hand searches to determine which abstracts should be reviewed for possible inclusion as per the reviewers defined eligibility criteria described under 'Types of studies', 'Types of participants', 'Types of interventions', and 'Types of outcome measures'.</LI>
<LI>All abstracts were assessed using the eligibility criteria proposed by the reviewers for selecting papers.</LI>
<LI>We listed excluded trials with the reasons for exclusion.</LI>
<LI>We resolved discrepancies between individual authors (SNM, AA, and RM) through consensus.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality, hence risk of bias, was defined as the confidence that the design, conduct, and report restrict bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). It was evaluated independently by three authors (SNM, AA, and RM). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We wrote to the principle authors of included trials for complementary information. The following domains used to judge the included trials for risk of bias were:</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sequence allocation generation</I> </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. Sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. The trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias. The sequence generation method was not, or might not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are inadequate studies for our review and were to be excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment</I> </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. Allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, opaque, sealed, and serially numbered envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or, during enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. The trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations might have been foreseen in advance of, or during enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors</I> </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. Blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. There was insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used is likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias. There was no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Incomplete outcome data</I> </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. The underlying reasons for missingness were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods had been employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. There was insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data was likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias. The crude estimate of effects (eg, complete case estimate) was clearly biased due to the underlying reasons for missingness, and the methods used to handle missing data were unsatisfactory.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Selective outcome reporting</I> </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. The trial protocol is available and all of the trial's pre-specified outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported or similar.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. There was insufficient information to assess whether the magnitude and direction of the observed effect is related to selective outcome reporting.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias. Not all of the trial's pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported or similar.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Baseline imbalance</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias. There was no baseline imbalance in important characteristics.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias. The baseline characteristics were not reported.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias. There was a baseline imbalance due to chance, or due to imbalanced exclusion after randomisation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials assessed as having 'low risk of bias' in all individual domains above were considered 'trials with low risk of bias'. Trials assessed as having 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the specified above individual domains were considered trials with 'high risk of bias'.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we registered the length of follow-up and also whether the trial had reported the use of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>All three authors extracted data independently from the included trials.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Methods: methodological quality, type of randomised clinical trials (parallel or crossover), number of intervention arms, first author, country/institution of study, date, and status of publication.</LI>
<LI>Participants: numbers of patients and cysts randomised to each intervention arm, mean (or median) age, number of males, mean duration of disease at randomisation, form of hepatic hydatid cyst (echo pattern, location), mean diameter/volume of cyst in each intervention arm, inclusion and exclusion criteria.</LI>
<LI>Interventions.</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>PAIR: prophylactic regimen (dosage, duration), type of imaging guidance (US or CT), aspiration route (transhepatic, intercostal), aspiration tool (fine needle or catheter), protoscolicidal agents (hypertonic saline, alcohol).</LI>
<LI>Surgery: type of surgical procedure (radical, conservative, laparoscopic), type of residual cavity management, protoscolicidal agents.</LI>
<LI>Medical treatment: type of medication (albendazole, mebendazole, etc), dose of medication, duration of therapy, name of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, type of therapeutic schedule (cyclic or continuous treatment), route of administratio. </LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Outcomes: all outcomes were extracted from each included trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Data analysis </B>
<BR/>We planned to do the following statistical analyses: intention-to-treat analyses using the last reported observed response (carry forward) and including all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up. Binary outcomes would have been expressed as risk difference and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data would have been analysed using mean difference. The number-needed-to-treat would have been calculated as 1/(1-relative risk)*control group event rate. Rare events (morbidity plus mortality) would have been estimated by Peto odds ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1998</LINK>). A random-effects model and a fixed-effect model would have been used. In case of significant heterogeneity, potential causes for the heterogeneity would have been explored by sensitivity analyses. Due to the few trials identified, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>After excluding the duplicate and clearly irrelevant publications, a total of 52 references were identified and assessed for inclusion in the review. Of these, 50 references (45 case-only studies and five review articles) were excluded (see table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). Only two trials met the inclusion criteria. We did not identify any duplicate publications for the included trials. No additional trials were identified from bibliographic lists. Personal communication with the principal author of the included trials and the WHO-IWGE PAIR-co-ordinator yielded no further randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>The included trials were carried out by the same lead author in India. Both trials were in English. One trial compared PAIR with or without oral albendazole (n = 20) versus oral albendazole alone (n =10) in patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst disease (<LINK REF="STD-Khuroo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khuroo 1993</LINK>), and the other trial compared PAIR (n = 25) versus surgical treatment (n = 25) in patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst disease (<LINK REF="STD-Khuroo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Khuroo 1997</LINK>). Descriptions of the trials are shown in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. We did not find any randomised clinical trials comparing PAIR with no or sham intervention.</P>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the findings in the <LINK REF="STD-Khuroo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Khuroo 1997</LINK> trial. The trial compared PAIR versus surgery. Mean follow-up of patients was 17 months. There was no mortality in either group. The final cyst diameter did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.20). The echinococcal-antibody titers fell progressively after an initial rise in both groups. Procedure-related complications significantly occurred more frequently in the surgery group (32% versus 84%; P &lt; 0.001). However, 17 of the 21 surgery-related complications were fever.</P>
<P>The mean (+ SD) hospital stay was 4.2 + 1.5 days in the PAIR group versus 12.7 + 6.5 days in the surgery group (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>
<B>PAIR with or without oral albendazole versus oral albendazole alone</B>
<BR/>In the comparison made between PAIR with or without oral albendazole versus oral albendazole alone (<LINK REF="STD-Khuroo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khuroo 1993</LINK>), there was no mortality (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Serial ultrasonography showed heterogeneous echo pattern of the cysts in 18, uniform echogenicity in 11, and disappearance in three patients. Symptoms were relieved in all PAIR-treated patients (100%; n = 20) versus two (20%; n = 10) of the albendazole-treated patients (P &lt; 0.001). All the cysts treated with percutaneous drainage (n = 22) and only two (18.2%) of those treated with oral albendazole alone showed reduction in size and changes in echo pattern compatible with loss of viability (P &lt; 0.01). Maximum size reduction was observed in cysts treated with a combination of percutaneous drainage and albendazole (P &lt; 0.05). Complications observed with PAIR were cyst infection in two patients (10%), fever in three (15%), cyst biliary rupture in one (5%), and urticaria in two (10%). Three patients (15%) who received albendazole developed reversible elevation of liver enzymes.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-06 15:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Our systematic review of the available literature shows that there is a paucity of well designed, randomised trials comparing PAIR with surgery or with medical therapy in people with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts. Both of the included trials had methodological flaws. They had adequate allocation concealment and follow-up. However, generation of allocation sequence and blinding method were unclear in both. The number of patients enrolled in these trials are scanty for a definite conclusion to be drawn. Moreover, in both trials, the follow-up duration of less than 18 months is too short to assess outcome measures like recurrence rate and long-term complications. In addition, the current methods of assessing response to treatment (that is, volume loss and change in echo pattern on transabdominal ultrasound) may miss some persistent or recurrent infestations. We could not perform meta-analyses due to the insufficient number of trials for each comparison.</P>
<P>In a recently published meta-analysis of uncontrolled studies, Smego et al (<LINK REF="STD-Smego-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smego 2003</LINK>) concluded that PAIR is safe and effective for treatment of uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst. Although the number of patients included in their meta-analysis is appreciable, their work has some shortcomings. First, they have explained that from 45 entries retrieved for PAIR, 21 were included, while it is not clear how many entries for the surgical group were retrieved and how many were included. Second, there is no table showing excluded studies in either group. Third, the authors have not performed a test of heterogeneity to look for methodological differences between the studies. This is important because if the studies are heterogeneous, their meta-analysis will not provide meaningful information unless relatively homogeneous subgroups are defined and assessed separately. Fourth, the authors have described the PAIR method in detail, while they have gone through the surgical methods only in brief. Fifth, it is not clear what type of patients have gone to surgery. Have more complicated patients with a predictable poorer outcome from the very beginning been sent to surgery (which is the usual case) or were the two patient populations (PAIR and surgery groups) comparable? Sixth, several different surgical methods have been used in the surgical studies included. This has important messages; first, probably different patient populations were being dealt with, and second, these different methods affect the outcomes significantly, so they cannot be compared effectively. These are important pieces of information that are missing in the meta-analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Smego-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smego 2003</LINK>. Therefore, their conclusion should be considered with caution.</P>
<P>Another review was published by Dziri et al, assessing all studies on different treatments of hydatid cysts (<LINK REF="STD-Dziri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dziri 2004</LINK>). The authors described their work as a systematic review and have explained a relatively detailed methodology, but there are some problems with this work. First, the authors have tried to cover several questions. Each of these questions needs its own definitions and is probably the subject of a separate systematic review. Therefore, they are not addressing a focused clinical question but several broad questions. Second, outcome measures are not clearly defined by the authors and they are not addressed adequately. Third, we have been unable to identify a published, peer-reviewed protocol for their review. Therefore, we cannot assess if the review has been conducted in a systematic manner. Although the authors have come to what seems to be sensible conclusions, their study should be regarded as an excellent narrative review, but not a systematic one.</P>
<P>One of the major issues in patients treated with PAIR and other percutaneous techniques is the definition of a successful outcome. Usually, therapeutic response is measured by volume loss of the cyst or change of echo. These outcome measures may not correlate sufficiently with the risk of long-term recurrence. Also serological tests may not adequately reflect the clinical course of patients.</P>
<P>The uncontrolled trials and the reviews of them show promise for PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage in treatment of hepatic hydatid cysts. This can serve as a basis for future randomised clinical trials. According to our systematic review and other authors, there are only a few randomised clinical trials in the literature addressing the issue. The quality of the trials can at best be judged as moderate; therefore, one can conclude that PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage, although promising in selected cases of uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts, cannot be yet recommended as a first line treatment. Future well-designed and high-quality randomised clinical trials with larger numbers of patients and longer duration of follow-up are necessary to address the topic.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-08-26 10:56:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to our systematic review, PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage may be comparable or superior to surgery or medical treatment with benzimidazoles alone for uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cysts, but the data are not sufficient to draw definite conclusions. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage outside randomised clinical trials for treating patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-12-06 15:33:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary to address the topic. We need randomised clinical trials comparing the PAIR method with or without benzimidazole coverage versus sham or no intervention, surgery, or medical treatment for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst. Because the disease is not so common, multicentre trials might be necessary. They also have the advantage of higher external validity. Future trials should have sufficient statistical power, low risk of bias, adequate follow-up, intensive monitoring of adverse events, and should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org). If the effects of PAIR are as promising as indicated in the present review, then the size of trials does not need to be very large, and data should be monitored closely by an independent data monitoring and safety committee.</P>
