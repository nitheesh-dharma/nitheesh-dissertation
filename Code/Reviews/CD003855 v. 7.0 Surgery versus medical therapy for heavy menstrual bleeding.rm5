<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane review authors compared the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of surgery versus medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem, which can impair a woman's quality of life. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy and various methods of endometrial ablation or resection (cutting out or destroying the lining of the uterus). Medical treatment includes various oral medications and a hormone-releasing device that is implanted in the uterus (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, LNG-IUS).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 15 randomised controlled trials that compared surgery versus oral medication or LNG-IUS. Participants were 1289 women with self reported heavy menstrual bleeding. The evidence is current to January 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Hysterectomy, endometrial surgery and the LNG-IUS were all effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding, though surgery was most effective, at least over the short term. These treatments suited most women better than oral medication. Although hysterectomy will stop heavy menstrual bleeding, it is associated with serious complications and most women should probably try a less radical treatment as first-line therapy. Both conservative surgery and LNG-IUS appear to be safe, acceptable and effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were lack of blinding, attrition and imprecision. It was difficult to interpret study findings over long-term follow-up because a large number of women randomised to medical treatment subsequently underwent surgery.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted the data. Our primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding, satisfaction rate and adverse events.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-21 00:42:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 parallel-group RCTs (1289 women). Surgical interventions included hysterectomy and endometrial resection or ablation. Medical interventions included oral medication and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS). The overall quality of the evidence for different comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were lack of blinding, attrition and imprecision. Moreover, it was difficult to interpret long-term study findings as many women randomised to medical interventions subsequently underwent surgery.</P>
<P>
<I>Surgery versus oral medication</I>
</P>
<P>Surgery (endometrial resection) was more effective in controlling bleeding at four months (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.64, one RCT, 186 women, moderate quality evidence) and also at two years (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.57, one RCT, 173 women, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at five years (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.34, one RCT, 140 women, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Satisfaction with treatment was higher in the surgical group at two years (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.74, one RCT, 173 women, moderate quality evidence), but there was no evidence of a difference between the groups at five years (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.37, one RCT, 114 women, very low quality evidence). There were fewer adverse events in the surgical group at four months (RR 0.26, 95 CI 0.15 to 0.46, one RCT, 186 women). These findings require cautious interpretation, as 59% of women randomised to the oral medication group had had surgery within two years and 77% within five years.</P>
<P>
<I>Surgery versus LNG-IUS</I>
</P>
<P>When hysterectomy was compared with LNG-IUS, the hysterectomy group were more likely to have objective control of bleeding at one year (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.19, one RCT, 223 women, moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in quality of life between the groups at five or 10 years, but by 10 years 46% of women originally assigned to LNG-IUS had undergone hysterectomy. Adverse effects associated with hysterectomy included surgical complications such as bladder or bowel perforation and vesicovaginal fistula. Adverse effects associated with LNG-IUS were ongoing bleeding and hormonal symptoms.</P>
<P>When conservative surgery was compared with LNG-IUS, at one year the surgical group were more likely to have subjective control of bleeding (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.32, five RCTs, 281 women, low quality evidence, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 15%). Satisfaction rates were higher in the surgical group at one year (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04, to 1.28, six RCTs, 442 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 27%), but this finding was sensitive to the choice of statistical model and use of a random-effects model showed no conclusive evidence of a difference between the groups. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in satisfaction rates at two years (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, two RCTs, 117 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 1%).</P>
<P>At one year there were fewer adverse events (such as bleeding and spotting) in the surgical group (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82, three RCTs, moderate quality evidence). It was unclear what proportion of women assigned to LNG-IUS underwent surgery over long-term follow-up, as there were few data beyond one year.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-18 14:55:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery, especially hysterectomy, reduces menstrual bleeding more than medical treatment at one year. There is no conclusive evidence of a difference in satisfaction rates between surgery and LNG-IUS, though adverse effects such as bleeding and spotting are more likely to occur with LNG-IUS. Oral medication suits a minority of women in the long term, and the LNG-IUS device provides a better alternative to surgery in most cases. Although hysterectomy is a definitive treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding, it can cause serious complications for a minority of women. Most women may be well advised to try a less radical treatment as first-line therapy. Both LNG-IUS and conservative surgery appear to be safe, acceptable and effective.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-21 00:38:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding, also known as menorrhagia, is a common gynaecological problem that creates a major burden in terms of quality of life and financial costs for many women (<LINK REF="REF-Frick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frick 2009</LINK>). Heavy menstrual bleeding also uses substantial healthcare resources (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). A general practice (GP) survey of menstruating women conducted in the UK found that the 12-month incidence of self reported menorrhagia was 25%, without significant variation by age (<LINK REF="REF-Shapley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapley 2004</LINK>). A comparable prevalence rate is likely in other western countries. In New Zealand, a GP database indicated that about 2.3% of GP consultations for women aged under 50 years were for heavy menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-RNZCGP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RNZCGP 2002</LINK>). Rates in non-western countries are unknown.</P>
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding has been defined as a blood loss of 80 ml or more per menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>), which is unrelated to pregnancy or known pelvic or systemic disease. However, perception of heavy bleeding is highly subjective and the actual blood loss of women seeking medical care is often less than 80 ml. When menstrual blood loss is measured, only about half of the women attending gynaecology clinics with a complaint of menorrhagia have a loss of 80 ml per cycle or more (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higham-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>An objective measure of blood loss has been devised, which involves soaking used sanitary pads and tampons and calculating the optical density of the resulting solution (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1964</LINK>). This method is accurate but is also complicated and time consuming. A simpler measure is the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC), whereby a woman assesses the blood loss on her used sanitary pads or tampons and assigns a numerical score accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>). Though popular, the PBAC system has not proved to be reliable and appears to have little advantage over a woman's subjective report of her blood loss, which in practice is usually the primary consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently it has been suggested that total menstrual fluid loss may be used as an assessment of menorrhagia (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>). Measurement is determined by the difference in weight of tampons or pads before and after use. Total menstrual fluid loss has been found to correlate well with changes in objective menstrual blood loss and may be of more relevance to women concerned mainly about flooding (rather than the composition of the loss).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-21 00:48:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A minority of women reporting heavy menstrual bleeding may simply require reassurance that their blood loss is within the normal range.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Medical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Where active management is preferred, first-line treatment is generally medical. Several alternatives are available, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the levonorgestrel-intrauterine device (LNG-IUS);</LI>
<LI>anti-fibrinolytic drugs;</LI>
<LI>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);</LI>
<LI>progestogens (short or long course);</LI>
<LI>the combined oral contraceptive pill;</LI>
<LI>danazol;</LI>
<LI>a combination of drugs (e.g. tranexamic acid plus a NSAID).</LI>
</UL>
<P>All the medical therapies mentioned above have been shown to be at least partially effective in reducing menstrual blood loss. A decision analysis comparing the efficacy, side effects and consumer acceptability of these treatments ranked them in the order shown above, with the LNG-IUS coming top (<LINK REF="REF-NZ-Guidelines-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NZ Guidelines 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Surgery may be indicated for women who have completed childbearing and for whom medical treatment is ineffective or intolerable, or it may be chosen as first-line therapy. Again a wide variety of options is available.</P>
<P>Hysterectomy has traditionally been regarded as the definitive surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding and has been one of the most commonly performed operations, with menstrual disorders being a leading indication (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>). The surgery can be performed abdominally, vaginally or laparoscopically but there is good evidence that the vaginal route is associated with shorter recovery time and fewer complications than the abdominal route (<LINK REF="REF-Nieboer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieboer 2009</LINK>). However, hysterectomy by any route has a relatively high incidence of short-term complications such as haemorrhage (serious blood loss), infection and wound healing problems and it also requires a lengthy postoperative recovery period. Moreover, a relationship has been found between hysterectomy and early ovarian failure (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2005</LINK>), while long-term effects on cardiovascular (heart) function are unclear. Nevertheless, hysterectomy is 100% successful in treating heavy menstrual bleeding and for most women any problems are relatively short-term. Satisfaction rates after hysterectomy are very high, at over 95% up to three years after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure with significant adverse effects and heavy menstrual bleeding is a benign condition, many women prefer one of the less invasive surgical options that are now available and which conserve the uterus. These procedures are known as endometrial resection or ablation and involve the destruction of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) and the underlying basal glands by various means. Surgery may be preceded by a course of hormonal medication to thin the walls of the endometrium in order to facilitate its removal. Hormones used include goserelin (a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue, or GnRHa) and danazol (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>'First-generation' techniques for endometrial destruction utilise a surgical telescope (hysteroscope) to aid viewing of the uterus along with a variety of electrosurgical or laser tools. These techniques require a general or regional anaesthetic, specialised surgical skill and often a short hospital admission. They are significantly safer than hysterectomy but still involve a small risk of uterine perforation, haemorrhage, fluid overload and infection; the short-term complication rate is around 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Overton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 1997</LINK>). There is no guarantee that bleeding will be reduced to acceptable levels in the long term. In one study at around four-year follow-up, 38% of those who had had endometrial ablation went on to receive further surgical treatment of some kind for continued excessive bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Aberdeen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aberdeen 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>'Second-generation' techniques utilise the controlled application to the surface of the endometrium of heat, cold, microwave or other forms of energy with sufficient power to produce necrosis (cell death) of the full thickness of the tissue. Most of these techniques are 'non-hysteroscopic', meaning that they can be performed without direct visualisation through a hysteroscope (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2013a</LINK>). They include microwave ablation, a fluid-filled thermal balloon system, free fluid thermal ablation and bipolar electrocautery (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). Such methods require sophisticated equipment but less specialised surgical skill than hysteroscopic methods and thus can usually be done as day or outpatient surgery with a local anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Jack-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jack 2005</LINK>). Economic modelling suggests that second-generation techniques may be more cost-effective than first-generation methods (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001501.pub4/full#CD001501-bbs2-0055">Garside 2004</A>). A Cochrane systematic review found that success rates and complication profiles of newer techniques of ablation appear to compare favourably with hysteroscopic techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared to hysterectomy, endometrial destruction techniques have a shorter operation time and hospital stay, quicker recovery, fewer postoperative complications and comparable satisfaction rates. Ongoing contraception is essential for sexually active women after conservative surgery even though fertility is usually not retained (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opperman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opperman 1998</LINK>). Moreover, women are likely to continue to experience some degree of menstrual bleeding and may need further surgery if menorrhagia persists. This potential need for re-treatment over the long term has narrowed the cost gap between hysterectomy and conservative surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2013</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-21 01:47:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical interventions vary in their mode of action, as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The levonorgestrel-intrauterine device (LNG-IUS) is a device that is implanted in the uterus for up to five years. It releases a low dose of a progestogenic hormone, which acts locally to suppress endometrial activity. The device also provides contraception, with fertility returning when the device is removed. It has been reported to reduce menstrual blood loss by 94% after three months and to be well accepted by most women (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1998</LINK>). However, a LNG-IUS frequently causes irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting, especially during the first few months of use (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luukkainen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luukkainen 2001</LINK>). Moreover, some women experience hormonal side effects such as weight gain, breast tenderness and bloating and occasionally the device is expelled spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2015</LINK>). Other less common but more severe side effects include the increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, should a sexually transmitted infection occur, the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy should pregnancy occur, and the risk of uterine perforation, which is a rare but serious event (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). An increased incidence of ovarian cysts has been reported in women using intrauterine progestogenic implants; these are a transient phenomenon, which resolves spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Brache-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brache 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Anti-fibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid work by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis). These drugs reduce bleeding by about 40% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2009b</LINK>), but do not generally alleviate menstrual cramping (<LINK REF="REF-Preston-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1995</LINK>). They are taken only during menstruation and are usually well tolerated but can cause mild nausea and diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as mefenamic acid and naproxen reduce blood loss by 33% to 55% and also relieve menstrual cramps. They act by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin (a fatty acid that is typically over-produced in women with heavy menstrual bleeding). They can cause headaches and gastrointestinal disturbances though significant side effects are unlikely as NSAIDs need to be taken only during menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2013</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Progestogens such as norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate are hormones which suppress endometrial growth and activity. Given as a 21-day course, from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, they reduce blood flow substantially (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2008</LINK>). However, they are considered unacceptable for long-term use by many women due to the prevalence of side effects such as breast tenderness, bloating and headaches; they may also precipitate breakthrough bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1998</LINK>). Progestogens have been shown to be less effective if taken as a short course, i.e. only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (between ovulation and menstruation) (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There is some indication that the combined oral contraceptive pill significantly reduces menstrual blood loss and relieves cramping; in addition it provides contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1991</LINK>). However, randomised evidence is very scanty (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2009</LINK>). This treatment may work by inhibiting the growth and development of the endometrium. Side effects include irregular bleeding, especially on treatment initiation. Some women report other hormonal effects such as headaches, nausea, dizziness and breast tenderness, though these are less prevalent with currently available low-dose combined oral contraceptives than with older preparations. Weight gain is often perceived as a side effect of combined oral contraceptive use, but no causal association has been found. The risk of arterial thrombotic events is increased threefold by combined oral contraceptive use, and the risk of venous thromboembolism is doubled; however these serious events remain very rare among healthy women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Dragoman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dragoman 2014</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Danazol is a synthetic hormone that causes the endometrium to shrink and is usually highly effective in reducing blood loss. It is generally only used for short-term treatment due to the prevalence and severity of side effects such as weight gain, headache, nausea, tiredness and acne (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumont-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumont 2007</LINK>). Barrier contraception is recommended to prevent possible fetal damage (<LINK REF="REF-New-Ethicals-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">New Ethicals 2000</LINK>). When treatment is discontinued, the effects of danazol persist for two to three cycles before blood loss returns to pre-treatment levels (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1979</LINK>).</LI>

<P>Two review authors (JM and AL) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to assess risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance and detection bias (blinding of participants and personnel and outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>For dichotomous data (for example, the proportion of women reporting control of bleeding) we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate risk ratios (RRs).

For all outcomes we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>
<P>We used data in meta-analysis only if the underlying distribution of the measurements appeared normal. The ratio of the mean to its standard deviation gives a crude method of assessing skew; if this ratio was less than 2.0 for any group in a trial, or if results were reported in the publication as median and range, we reported the data in text in 'Additional tables'.

Women dissatisfied with one medical therapy were encouraged to try other medical options.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kupperman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kupperman 2004</LINK> compared the cost of hysterectomy and oral medication by measuring relative resource use over a 24-month follow-up with assessments conducted three-monthly. In the first 12 months of follow-up, using intention-to-treat analysis, women in the hysterectomy group used significantly more resources (USD 6777 versus USD 4479, P value = 0.03) attributable mainly to use of inpatient care. During the second year of follow-up resource use was roughly equivalent in the surgical and medical groups (USD 1360 versus USD 1338 respectively). Within two years there was a 53% rate of cross-over to hysterectomy in the medical group, which accounted for the similarity in resource use. In 'as-treated' analyses, mean total resource use for women in the medical group who did not subsequently receive hysterectomy was USD 2595 compared to USD 7024 for women in the hysterectomy group.</P>

Women treated by hysterectomy were more likely to reports feelings of incomplete emptying than LNG-IUS users, and stress urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections were also more common in the hysterectomy group. The hysterectomy group were also more likely to use medication for urinary incontinence. This study also investigated the effect of the interventions on markers of cardiovascular risk, and reported that women who had hysterectomy had higher levels of serum inflammatory markers and increased use of diabetes medication, compared to LNG-IUS users.

There was no evidence of a difference between the groups, though numbers were small (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Talis 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>At five years, <LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> reported that 50 of the 60 women who no longer had a LNG-IUS in situ had had a hysterectomy (representing 42% of those randomised to LNG-IUS) and one had had thermo-ablation. By 10 years, 55 women in the LNG-IUS group (46% of those randomised to LNG-IUS) had had a hysterectomy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ghazizdeh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ghazizdeh 2014</LINK> noted that three women in the hysteroscopic endometrial resection group eventually underwent hysterectomy for heavy bleeding. There was apparently no requirement for additional surgery in the other two groups in this study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Requirement for additional medical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Very few women were reported as undergoing additional medical treatment. At one year in one study one woman in the surgical group (&lt; 3%) who had persistent menorrhagia was receiving medical treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1997</LINK>). At two years five women in the surgical group in <LINK REF="STD-Talis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Talis 2006</LINK> had had a LNG-IUS inserted.</P>
<P>Two studies mentioned re-insertion of the LNG-IUS; this was required by five women in <LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> within the first year and one woman in <LINK REF="STD-Istre-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Istre 1998</LINK> within three years. Of 57 women in <LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> who had the LNG-IUS in situ at five years, eight had had a replacement.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> compared the cost of hysterectomy and LNG-IUS. Although 42% of the LNG-IUS group subsequently underwent hysterectomy, the overall direct and indirect costs after five years were about 40% lower in the LNG-IUS group. Sensitivity analyses using different cost estimates had little impact on these findings. At 10-year follow-up, the overall costs were lower in the LNG-IUS group (USD 3423 per participant versus USD 4937), even though 46% of the LNG-IUS group subsequently had surgery.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Talis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Talis 2006</LINK> reported the cost-effectiveness of thermal balloon ablation versus LNG-IUS. The expected direct and indirect costs of treatment were USD 1693 for ablation and USD 869 for the LNG-IUS. The findings were robust to changes in key drivers of costs. Since the treatments appeared to result in similar quality of life outcomes (measured by the SF-36) the authors concluded that the LNG-IUS was more cost-effective than thermal balloon ablation.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-21 01:41:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comparison of surgical versus medical treatments is complicated by the variety of treatments available within each modality, particularly with respect to medical approaches. The medical treatment in two of the studies comprised a wide range of oral hormonal and non-hormonal medications. The medical treatment in the other studies was very different, consisting of an intrauterine device. As a result, the focus of this systematic review effectively split into two main comparisons: surgery versus oral medication and surgery versus levonorgestrel-intrauterine device (LNG-IUS).</P>
<P>Women in the surgical arms of these studies underwent a variety of operations that included the relatively simple procedure of endometrial ablation, the more specialised technique of endometrial resection and the radical option of hysterectomy. Despite this, the studies comparing different types of surgery versus LNG-IUS reported fairly consistent findings, save for the inevitable disparity in outcomes measuring blood loss when hysterectomy comprised one of the comparisons.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Menstrual bleeding</HEADING>
<P>Neither medical treatment nor conservative surgery can rival hysterectomy in achieving 100% cessation of bleeding. No other intervention considered in this review was effective for all women, but some were more effective than others. Endometrial resection was much more successful than oral medication in controlling bleeding at four months' follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1997</LINK>. As most of the women in this study (78%) had tried medical therapy unsuccessfully in the past, it is questionable whether the poor results achieved with oral medication are generalisable to women with heavy menstrual bleeding who newly present for treatment. Conservative surgery was more effective than LNG-IUS in controlling bleeding at one year, but both approaches had high rates of success in all the relevant studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Definition of treatment success is necessarily subjective and perhaps best based on a woman's satisfaction level and willingness to continue a particular therapy. Women who had transcervical endometrial resection or hysterectomy rated their satisfaction with treatment and their overall quality of life higher than women who had oral medication. However, when conservative surgery (endometrial ablation or resection) was compared with LNG-IUS, rates of satisfaction were high in both groups and did not differ substantially. Similarly, studies that used multidimensional scales to measure quality of life found few differences between surgery and LNG-IUS.</P>
<P>A very high proportion of women randomised to receive medical treatment subsequently required surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Kupperman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kupperman 2004</LINK>, 53% of women in the medical group had had a hysterectomy by two years and in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1997</LINK> 77% of women initially assigned oral medication had had surgery within five years. Seventeen per cent (47/275) of women in the LNG-IUS arms of the six relevant studies had had surgery by one year.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects such as nausea, headaches and weight gain were reported by about half of the women who took oral medication and "bad side effects" were cited by 45% of the 60 women who found the treatment unacceptable at four months (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1997</LINK>). Women with a LNG-IUS also commonly reported adverse effects, often hormonal symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating and intermenstrual bleeding. The LNG-IUS group was also more likely to develop transient asymptomatic ovarian cysts.</P>
<P>Women who had endometrial resection or balloon ablation were overall less likely to experience adverse effects than women having medical treatment.</P>
<P>The adverse effects of hysterectomy were potentially life-threatening. They included bladder and bowel perforations, infected pelvic haematomas and peritonitis. By treatment received, there were 39 complications among 131 women who had a hysterectomy. A substudy of <LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> evaluated the effect of hysterectomy or LNG-IUS on ovarian function and concluded that hysterectomy but not LNG-IUS appeared to alter intra-ovarian blood flow and possibly impair ovarian function (<LINK REF="REF-Halmesmaki-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halmesmaki 2007</LINK>). Moreover at 10-year follow-up, in an "as treated" analysis, stress urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections were more common in women who received a hysterectomy than in ongoing LNG-IUS users and women who had hysterectomy had higher levels of markers for cardiovascular risk. The finding with respect to increased risk of urinary tract infections in the hysterectomy group persisted when the analysis was controlled for the occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Heliovaara_x002d_Peippo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heliovaara-Peippo 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment choice</HEADING>
<P>All the interventions considered in this review significantly reduced menstrual bleeding and improved health-related quality of life from baseline and could be considered for treating menorrhagia. Oral medication may be effective and acceptable for some women, and worth trying before resorting to more invasive procedures, but probably will not suit the majority of women for long-term use. The LNG-IUS presents a suitable alternative to surgery for many women and although it reduces bleeding significantly less than surgical methods during the first year of use it has the advantage of being easily reversible. Conservative surgery and the LNG-IUS both provide satisfactory treatment for the majority of women who perceive their menstrual blood loss as heavy, and neither precludes further intervention if needed. Our findings suggest that an individual woman's preferences and circumstances are the most important factor in treatment choice. Hysterectomy is the only treatment guaranteed to stop all menstrual bleeding but in view of its potential complications most women may be well advised to try a less radical treatment as first-line therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK> explored their data using a multiple regression model in order to identify predictors of outcome at one year. Women without objective menorrhagia (that is at least 80 ml blood loss per menstrual period) had a significantly better outcome with the LNG-IUS than with hysterectomy in scores for health-related quality of life and in partner sexual satisfaction. Neither age nor the presence of fibroids were predictive of outcome. This suggests that pretreatment assessment of menstrual blood loss may be useful for determining which women will require hysterectomy. This approach is complicated by the difficulty in achieving an objective assessment of menstrual blood loss.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-21 00:30:49 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the included studies the diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding was based on self report, with or without a bleeding score chart, and it is possible that many of the participants did not have objective menorrhagia (blood loss &gt; 80 ml/cycle). There was notable disparity in the criteria used for menorrhagia even between studies that used the same measure; the three studies using pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) scores to determine eligibility for inclusion had thresholds ranging from 75 ml to 150 ml.</P>
<P>The benefits of oral medication as a first-line treatment were not accurately reflected in these studies as the vast majority of women had already tried at least one oral medication without success.</P>
<P>More evidence comparing second-generation surgical methods with intrauterine devices is required, and a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is currently underway in the Netherlands, comparing the cost-effectiveness of endometrial ablation versus LNG-IUS in women with menorrhagia (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 2013</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-01-20 03:33:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the studies were blinded, and blinding would scarcely be feasible for these interventions. We judged that this created a high risk of bias for subjective review outcomes. Another common limitation in the studies was high risk of attrition bias, as six of the studies were missing data for 18% to 30% of randomised participants at follow-up points ranging from one to five years.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for different comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were lack of blinding, attrition and imprecision. Moreover it was difficult to interpret study findings over follow-up due to confounding associated with women who had been randomised to medical treatment subsequently undergoing surgery.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-21 01:39:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings were largely consistent with a health technology assessment of hysterectomy, endometrial ablation and LNG-IUS for heavy menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharya-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharya 2011</LINK>), which included comparisons of surgery versus LNG-IUS, using individual participant data for a total of 730 women. They concluded that LNG-IUS is potentially cheaper and more effective than first-generation endometrial ablation techniques and that LNG-IUS is associated with similar satisfaction rates to second-generation endometrial ablation. They suggested that there is weak evidence to suggest that hysterectomy is preferable to LNG-IUS in terms of satisfaction rates, and that hysterectomy is considered the most cost-effective strategy. They concluded that owing to its invasive nature and risk of complications hysterectomy is considered a final option by gynaecological experts and consumers.</P>
<P>NICE guidelines review medical and surgical options for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and are broadly in agreement with our findings (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). The guidelines support the use of LNG-IUS as first-line medical treatment, provided long-term (at least 12 months) use is anticipated and that hormonal treatment is acceptable. With regard to surgery, they support the use of endometrial ablation as first or second-line therapy where bleeding is having a severe impact on a woman's quality of life, and she does not want to conceive in the future. They recommend consideration the following second-generation techniques: impedance-controlled bipolar radiofrequency ablation (described in this review as bipolar electrocauterisation), fluid-filled thermal balloon endometrial ablation, microwave endometrial ablation and free fluid thermal endometrial ablation. They suggest that first-generation ablation techniques are appropriate provided hysteroscopic myomectomy is to be included in the procedure. NICE recommend against using hysterectomy as a routine first-line treatment solely for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>

<P>Surgery, especially hysterectomy, reduces menstrual bleeding more than medical treatment at one year. There is no conclusive evidence of a difference in satisfaction rates between surgery and a levonorgestrel-intrauterine device (LNG-IUS), though adverse effects such as bleeding and spotting are more likely to occur with LNG-IUS. Oral medication suits a minority of women in the long term, and a LNG-IUS device provides a better alternative to surgery in most cases. A high proportion of women initially treated with oral medication, conservative surgery or LNG-IUS require further intervention. Although hysterectomy is a definitive treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding, it can cause serious complications and most women may be well advised to try a less radical treatment as first-line therapy. Both LNG-IUS and conservative surgery appear to be safe, acceptable and effective.</P>

<P>In early versions of the review we reported menstrual loss as "change in menstrual loss". From 2016 onwards we combined change and end scores where studies reported continuous outcomes on the same scale (as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)), and we renamed the outcomes as simply "menstrual loss".</P>
<P>In the 2016 update, we endeavoured to reduce the number of primary outcomes and the number of outcomes overall, in line with current Cochrane policy that outcomes should be as few as possible and that primary outcomes should normally reflect at least one potential benefit and at least one potential area of harm. We achieved this by the following changes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In earlier versions of the review quality of life and need for additional surgery were primary outcomes. From 2016 onwards these became secondary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>For the outcome "quality of life", we limited the measure to "self-reported change in quality of life, recorded in a reproducible and validated format". Previously this outcome also included the measure "self reported change in premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) recorded in a reproducible and validated format".</LI>
<LI>We deleted the outcome "haemoglobin level" in line with the Cochrane policy of giving preference to patient-reported outcomes rather than biochemical measures.</LI>
<LI>We reduced the number of time points for follow-up to one year (or less), two years, five years and 10 years.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In 2016 we decided not to report numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTBs) with our effect estimates, as these are misleading given the very high cross-over rates between treatment arms.</P>
