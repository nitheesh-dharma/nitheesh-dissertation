I have spell checked this version.&lt;br&gt;Chris June 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;=================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Peer Review Feedback&lt;br&gt;Please see the attached Word document wtih extensive comments from 2 Peer reviewers. There are inaccuries in the results of this review that need to be changed. There are also issues around definition of non-specific cough and how it relates to asthma (or not), the dose of steroids used, whether any treatment is needed, and definition of the primary outcome.&lt;br&gt;This review will need revising please. &lt;br&gt;CJC 7 April 2005&lt;br&gt;=======================================&lt;br&gt;cjc 23 dec editing&lt;br&gt;Changes accepted. I am happy for this to go out for peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Anne Chang's response re: allocation methods (301104)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Toby&lt;br&gt;At that time I was inexperienced and didn't really have a lot of guidance at all! Had the medications in different bags with numbers and when the next subject came, I took the bag with the next sequential number. Not the way to do it!&lt;br&gt;Kind regards&lt;br&gt;Anne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 11 11 04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contributions: Brief but to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine but you need to specify what you mean by non-specific chronic cough and the other conditions that would count as exclusions (such as cystic fibrosis etc) under types of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels ; fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract : Please could Liz check the Search description in the abstract and text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Have  been changed into future tense for updates as no meta-analysis at this point  (very sensibly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Fine but conclusions are product specific and based on single trials. In my view the main conclusion of this review is that most children will resolve spontaneously and we need further evidence before concluding about the efficacy of high dose inhaled steroids! I gather that the conclusion reached by Davies was not in favour of high dose inhaled steroids? At the least I would rephrase this along the lines of discussing the possible benefits with parents (who may well have strong views on high dose inhaled steroids). Does the study consider adverse effects and what were the results of any measured? Text in red needs possible alteration in the conclusions please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: see above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: not done yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Toby please return to authors for consideration of the above comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Inhaled corticosteroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children (WITH CHRIS 081104)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Inhaled steroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Inhaled corticosteroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled corticosteroids for treating non-specific cough in children (MIKE's EDITS April 1005)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Inhaled steroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled corticosteroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children (WITH CHRIS 300605)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-03-30 16:30:46 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Paolo Rosati" REVIEW_NO="IST-OTH" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Inhaled corticosteroids for treating non-specific chronic cough in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Persistent cough in childhood is a common problem that is sometimes confused with asthma. This review questions the appropriateness of the common practice of using inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of children with cough and without any other evidence of asthma or any other chronic chest condition. The review found that there is currently no good evidence to suggest that treatment with standard doses of inhaled corticosteroids will be beneficial. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cough in isolation of other clinical features is known as non-specific cough, which has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or any known aetiology. In children with non-specific cough the possibility of asthma being the underlying disorder is often raised (so called cough variant asthma). The proponents of cough variant asthma suggest a therapeutic trial of medications usually used to treat asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in non-specific cough in children over the age of two years. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were conducted on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Searches were current as of March 2004. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised (randomised and quasi-randomised) controlled clinical trials in which an inhaled corticosteroid (beclomethasone (BDP), fluticasone (FP), triamcinalone (TAA) or any other corticosteroid) were given for cough in children over two years of age were included. Two review authors independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data from trials was extracted by both review authors and entered into the Cochrane Collaboration software program RevMan Analyses 1.0.2. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials met the inclusion criteria (123 participants). One compared inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (400 micrograms per day) with placebo and the other compared fluticasone propionate (2 mg per day for 3 days followed by 1 mg per day for 11 days) with placebo. Both studies used metered dose inhalers via a spacer. With the lower dose of inhaled corticosteroid there was no significant difference between the beclomethasone and placebo groups. With the higher dose there was a significant improvement in nocturnal cough frequency after two weeks in children presenting with persistent nocturnal cough. However, a significant but smaller improvement was also seen with placebo. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In one study beclomethasone dipropionate (400 micrograms per day) was no different from placebo in reducing the frequency of cough measured objectively or scored subjectively. There might be a small improvement with very high-dose inhaled corticosteroid but the clinical impact of this is unlikely to beneficial. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:42:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:14:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Cough is a very common problem experienced in childhood. This is most common at times of upper respiratory tract infections and is usually transient in nature. When cough persists for more than two or three weeks concerns are often raised as to whether there is an underlying chest disease. The term 'non-specific cough' is now used to describe children who have non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or any known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>). In a child with prolonged cough a detailed history and examination, occasionally followed in a small number of cases by targeted investigations, should allow the child to be placed in one of five broad diagnostic categories. These are: a normal child who is chronically exposed to an irritant (for example smoke, fresh paints, new carpeting, dry-air heating, an old pillow, a furry pet); a child with a serious illness such as cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis; a child with less serious but treatable causes of cough, for example postnasal drip; a child with an asthma syndrome; and a child where there is an overestimation of symptoms by either the child or family due to psychological or other reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2002</LINK>). The question is, what then happens to children with persistent cough who do not fall into these categories?</P>
<P>Increasingly, persistent non-specific cough in childhood is believed to be a disorder in its own right. There is evidence that children with non-specific cough have increased cough receptor sensitivity compared with healthy children (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1996</LINK>); and there is evidence that they do not necessarily have the atopic background seen in most asthmatic children (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). However, the lack of an objective test to prove asthma as a diagnosis in young children continues to fuel the uncertainty surrounding whether persistent cough without wheeze is due to asthma. Although treatments such as antibiotics, cough suppressants, anti-histamines and decongestants are often tried, common asthma therapies such as bronchodilators, sodium cromoglycate, inhaled and oral corticosteroids continue to be used as treatments for non-specific cough (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). One great difficulty with using these therapies is that non-specific cough is a self-limiting disorder and will usually get better on its own. Therapeutic trials of therapies without a good evidence base will often coincide with clinical improvement, fuelling the false impression of efficacy and reinforcing the use of unproven medications.</P>
<P>Understanding the history behind persistent non-specific cough in childhood is relevant to understanding the role of asthma therapies. Prior to the concept that non-specific cough could be a distinct disorder, or disorders, many considered it as part of childhood asthma, or 'cough-variant asthma'. Opinion was divided as to whether it was really asthma or not. There were proponents for (<LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doan 1992</LINK>) and against (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>) the diagnosis of asthma or so-called cough variant asthma in children with cough as the sole respiratory symptom. The proponents of cough variant asthma found that in patients presenting solely with chronic cough:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by an exercise provocation test in some children (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>obvious clinical asthma developed in some patients after long-term follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>personal and family histories of atopy and blood eosinophilia suggested an allergic diathesis. Chest radiographs showed hyperinflation in many, and spirometry showed bronchospasm (<LINK REF="REF-Yahav-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yahav 1982</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>there was a response to a therapeutic trial of asthma medication (for example inhaled corticosteroids), relapse on stopping medication and a second response on recommencing them (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>On this evidence the proponents of cough variant asthma recommended a therapeutic trial of medications usually used to treat asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Doan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doan 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK> and colleagues, on the other hand, found that children with recurrent cough in isolation of other symptoms differed significantly from those with asthma; with or without cough, in terms of airway hyperresponsiveness and atopy, among other factors. The non-wheezy children with cough had normal serum IgE levels and less atopy when compared with the wheezy children. Another study also found that children with persistent cough had less morbidity and less atopy compared with children with wheeze (<LINK REF="REF-Faniran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faniran 1998</LINK>). Despite these differences, for many general practitioners and paediatricians the most practicable approach to isolated non-specific cough is a therapeutic trial of ß2-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids, or both. This approach no doubt arises because cough is indeed a feature of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Picciotto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciotto 1998</LINK>). As inhaled corticosteroids are one of the main therapies used, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence that supports their use in persistent non-specific cough in children.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised (randomised and quasi-randomised) controlled clinical trials in which inhaled corticosteroids were given for non-specific cough in children (up to and including 16 years of age) were included. Non-specific cough is defined as dry, non-productive cough without any other respiratory or system sign or symptom. </P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>
<BR/>Children up to and including 16 years of age presenting with non-specific chronic cough that had persisted for more than 3 weeks and in all settings (inpatient or outpatient, general practice and the home). </P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: studies involving children under the age of two years were excluded since different pathophysiologies often occur in babies and young infants. Children with associated wheezy chest were also excluded so as to try and eliminate studies of asthma. We also excluded studies where there was another apparent cause for chronic cough, such as infective causes (for example whooping cough, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis), cardiovascular disease, other respiratory symptoms (for example productive cough, dyspnoea, aspiration), associated systemic illness (for example failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy) and presence of a lung function abnormality. <BR/>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids delivered by any means (aerosol, nebulised or by metered-dose inhaler (MDI)) with or without a holding chamber and with or without a mask. All doses and dosing regimes were included. </P>
<P>Studies including comparisons of: corticosteroids with placebo, corticosteroids with any other drug, and between different types of corticosteroids were included. Trials that included the use of other medications were included if all participants had equal access to such medications. </P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:15:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The full texts of potential studies for inclusion were obtained to decide if they should be included, or not, by one review author (AT). A list of excluded studies was made, with reasons for their exclusion documented. In order to make sure these decisions were made properly, a second review author (MM) independently selected the studies to be included as well. No disagreement occurred so a third review author was not needed.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:33:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trial data were extracted by both review authors and entered into the Cochrane Collaboration software program Review Manager. Data were entered for individual trials. Note was taken of: study setting, source of funding, patient recruitment, numbers of patients, exclusion and inclusion criteria, randomisation and allocation concealment methods, dose and type of therapy plus method of delivery, side effects and withdrawals with the preferred method of entering data based on an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:33:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies that met the inclusion criteria underwent quality assessment, which was performed independently by both review authors using two methods. The first method involved using the Cochrane approach to assessment of concealment of allocation. Trials were scored using the following principles.<BR/>Grade A: adequate concealment.<BR/>Grade B: unclear concealment.<BR/>Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment.</P>
<P>Secondly, each study was also assessed using a 1 to 5 scale as described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and summarised as follows.<BR/>Was the study described as randomised? (1 = yes; 0 = no).<BR/>Was the study described as double blind? (1 = yes; 0 = no).<BR/>Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? (1 = yes; 0 = no).<BR/>Was the method of randomisation clearly described and appropriate? (1 = yes; 0 = no).<BR/>Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (1 = yes; 0 = no).<BR/>One point was deducted when the methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Intended statistical methods for future versions of this review</HEADING>
<P>Future included trials will be combined using the RevMan Analyses 1.0.2. For dichotomous variables, individual and pooled statistics will be calculated as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

<B>Study design </B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> were randomised, double-blind, parallel group trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants </B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> recruited 43 participants (aged 6 to 17 years) from an outpatient clinic and <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> recruited 80 participants (aged 1 to 10 years), 50 of whom went into the study. In both studies, recruited participants were not experiencing current chest infections and had a recent history of persistent cough.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions </B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> compared beclomethasone dipropionate with placebo when inhaled in two puffs twice a day (100 µg beclomethasone per puff) for four to five weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> compared fluticasone propionate (1 mg per dose), or placebo, twice daily (2 mg per day) for three nights followed by 500 µg, or placebo, twice a day (1000 µg per day) for 11 nights. The initial very high dose was used to mimic the high doses of oral corticosteroids given to treat asthmatics effectively. Fourteen days was chosen as the treatment duration as inhaled corticosteroids are known to be effective in treating asthma by 14 days. Both studies used metered-dose inhalers via a spacer.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes assessed </B>
<BR/>In both studies the principal outcome assessed was the cough frequency, measured objectively. <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> monitored cough frequency using a video and auditory recording system. Recordings were made on two baseline nights and on nights three, four, fifteen and sixteen of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> monitored cough frequency over 24 hours, using a validated ambulatory cough meter, at baseline and after two weeks of inhaled ß2-agonist or placebo and then after four to five weeks of inhaled beclomethasone or placebo. Other outcomes reported in <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> were symptom scores using cough score charts (both parent and child completed) as well as measuring the lowest capsaicin concentration required to stimulate two coughs or more (Cth) and five coughs or more (C5). <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> studied other outcomes, including measuring an improvement in cough frequency by more than 75% in children with a positive skin test, an IgE level greater than 100 Ku/litre and a positive family history of atopy. <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> measured airway responsiveness to inhalations of hypertonic saline (4.5%) using an ultrasonic nebuliser (the dose of hypertonic saline was increased successively by doubling the previous inhalation time). Forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) was measured 60 seconds after each inhalation time. The test ceased when the FEV1 had fallen by 15% or more or when a cumulative inhalation time of 15.5 minutes had been achieved. The presence of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR positive) was defined as a fall from the baseline in FEV1 of 15% or more at any during the hypertonic saline challenge.</P>

The baseline cough frequency was much higher in those given beclomethasone and the difference in improvement between the treatment arms was not significant. There was no significant difference in symptoms score for either parent- or child-completed questionnaires (outcomes 03 and 04).

<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> reported that 12 of 22 participants on inhaled corticosteroid and 10 of 22 on placebo had improved by 75% in frequency of cough on nights three and four (published P value 0.76; outcome 03). On nights 15 and 16, 17 of 24 on steroids and 8 of 23 on placebo experienced a similar improvement (published P value 0.03; outcome 04). With a 75% improvement, classed as a substantial improvement, the proportion of patients not substantially improved by days three and four was similar in each treatment arm using intention-to-treat analysis (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.04; P value 0.96), whereas by days 15 to 16 the difference favoured inhaled fluticasone propionate (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.92; P value 0.04). The trialists conducted subgroup analyses in order to identify responders in terms of changes in skin prick test, IgE and family history of atopy, for both the inhaled corticosteroid and placebo groups. No significant relationship between any of these variables and 75% improvement in cough frequency on nights 15 and 16 were identified in the inhaled corticosteroid group (outcomes 05 to 07). The authors pointed out that although cough at entry to the study was reported to last a long time (median one year) a large proportion (8 of 23, 35%) improved with placebo. Twenty-seven of the fifty children were followed up between six and 12 months later in the clinic or by telephone.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:42:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review questions the appropriateness of the common practice of using inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of children with cough without any other evidence of airway obstruction. Identifying children who are unlikely to benefit from medications used for asthma could not only potentially prevent the inappropriate diagnostic labelling of asthma in a large group of children, but also save these children from the use of unnecessary medications and their associated side effects. It would also save their parents from any unnecessary expense.</P>
<P>The promotion of the diagnosis of asthma based on the symptom of cough alone has led to the overuse of corticosteroids in children with recurrent cough (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1995</LINK>). The findings of a lack of response to inhaled medications used routinely for asthma, irrespective of the presence of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), are supported by epidemiological data (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lombard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombard 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Clifford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 1989</LINK> found no association between cough and either AHR or atopy after controlling for wheeze. They suggested that in the absence of wheeze, the significance of cough and dyspnoea for the diagnosis of asthma in epidemiological studies should be questioned.</P>
<P>This review supports growing epidemiological evidence that cough alone is a poor marker for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1975</LINK> were the first to describe cough as a presenting symptom of asthma in adults. All participants in this study had exertional dyspnoea and abnormal baseline expiratory flow volume loops consistent with moderate airways obstruction. Subsequent studies of cough variant asthma included adults and children without any abnormality of their baseline pulmonary function (<LINK REF="REF-Carrao-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrao 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheriyan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheriyan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK>). Many of these studies used asthma medications for adults and children with cough variant asthma but had no placebo arm. Results were based on subjective reporting of cough, which is known to be unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>). The studies included in this review are not comparable to the study of <LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK>, which included children with abnormal baseline lung function or chest physical examination. The children in the studies included in this review had normal physical examination and, when measured, normal spirometry. Similarly, in <LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK> six of the eight children who were able to perform pulmonary function tests had FEV1 predicted values of approximately 85%. More recently it has been argued that isolated cough is a poor marker of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1996</LINK>). Children with isolated cough do not have an atopic background and do not suffer the disability that asthmatic children suffer (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). Children with isolated non-specific cough tend to have slightly more reactive airways than controls but their airways are not as reactive as those of asthmatic children (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 2000</LINK>). For most children, isolated non-specific cough is a transient phenomenon.</P>
<P>Some children with persistent cough no doubt do have unrecognised wheeze, either because it is poorly perceived by their parents or it is not present at the time they present to a physician. It has also been suggested that this group has a higher wheeze threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Koh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 1993</LINK>). The fact that high doses of inhaled corticosteroid may have helped the coughers in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> does not mean that they necessarily had asthma. Indeed, very high doses of fluticasone propionate (2 mg per day for three days) had no advantage over placebo, suggesting that non-specific cough behaves in a much different way to asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK>). Isolated cough and associated atopic family history have been shown to be markers for the later development of wheeze (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1996</LINK>). Other researchers also found that children with cough and no wheeze had more atopy than controls but less than asthmatics (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). Eczema and hay fever, however, occurred similarly in coughers and the control population (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>). It may be that children with recurrent, persistent and isolated cough occupy an intermediate clinical position between children with no cough and those with wheeze with respect to atopy (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1989</LINK>), prognosis for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>), family history of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>), response to bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK>) and episodes of respiratory morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1984</LINK>). However, coughers appear to have normal lung function as measured by spirometry and airway responsiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>) suggesting strongly that isolated non-specific cough is a different condition to asthma.</P>
<P>Although cough is often used as a marker of asthma instability (<LINK REF="REF-Isles-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isles 1993</LINK>) the severity of cough has been shown to be unrelated to the airway calibre as measured by FEV1, peak expiratory flow or its variability (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>). In the laboratory, medications (for example cromolyn, atropine) that inhibit the bronchoconstriction that occurs with broncho-provocative challenges do not alter the cough response (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1983</LINK>). Conversely, other medications (lignocaine, codeine) that inhibit the induced cough have no effect on broncho-constriction (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1988</LINK>). In human airways the pathways for cough and bronchoconstriction are distinctly different (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shimuzu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimuzu 1996</LINK>). While the trigger for cough and airway narrowing may be the same, cough may persist despite adequate treatment of bronchoconstriction. It is, therefore, not surprising that the AHR-positive children in the <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> study responded to salbutamol and placebo in a similar manner to the AHR-negative children.</P>
<P>The number of participants in both studies included in our review was small but large enough to achieve a power of 80%, based on an expected difference of 70% in the frequency of cough. A larger number of participants would be necessary if a smaller expected difference was used. However, as previous studies of cough variant asthma achieved a complete resolution of cough (<LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>), a 70% reduction may be reasonable. Nevertheless, a type II error is possible and a larger study to confirm or dispute the findings of this study is encouraged. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> recorded cough over 24 hours using an ambulatory electromyography (EMG) cough meter. By using video and audio recordings, <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> (and other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Picciotto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciotto 1998</LINK>)) were also able to make observations of children with nocturnal cough in their own homes. Both methods eliminate the difficulties with diary card reporting and the problems associated with also recording cough of co-sleepers.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between very high doses of inhaled corticosteroid (2 mg of fluticasone propionate per day for three days) and placebo in the improvement in cough. The authors chose this dose, which is not licensed, so as to replicate the effect of the high doses of oral corticosteroids used in the treatment of asthma. Continuation of the same corticosteroids for a further 11 days at a dose still considered very high (1 mg per day) was associated with a significant improvement in recorded cough above and beyond that seen with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK>). The authors felt that the improvement seen did not justify the use of such high doses of inhaled corticosteroid, which are likely to cause adrenal suppression, in a condition where many improve with placebo. These doses are also well above those recommended for the treatment of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). It would, however, be of interest to establish if the benefit seen over placebo persisted with time as this might be important to patients, their parents and their physicians in assessing the pros and cons of such a treatment.</P>
<P>The treatment effect in older children with asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroid can be seen at 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 1995</LINK>), hence it is not unreasonable for both studies in this review to expect to identify a response over the five and two weeks of treatment given, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK>). Two studies have examined the effect of corticosteroids on cough and found no benefit at all (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evald-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evald 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Evald-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evald 1989</LINK> was not included in our review because it was not a randomised controlled study. <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> studied inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate at a dose of 400 micrograms per day over 4 to 5 weeks and found no effect on cough frequency or score, irrespective of the presence of AHR. The very high dose of corticosteroid used by <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> could explain why they identified a potential benefit. <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> also used objective recordings of nocturnal cough as their main outcome as opposed to the day and night objective recordings made by <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>. Whilst there is likely to be some correlation between day and night cough it is possible that there are different underlying mechanisms between day and night cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001b</LINK>). For example, corticosteroids have a positive effect on eosinophilic bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Brightling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brightling 2003</LINK>), are known to improve the inflammatory response to inhaled organic dust (<LINK REF="REF-Palmberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmberg 2004</LINK>) and are known to have a small beneficial effect in viral-induced wheeze in children (<LINK REF="REF-Mckean-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mckean 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> found that compliance with taking the corticosteroid was 55%, which may have had a bearing on the results. In comparison, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> was much shorter and probably encouraged better adherence to treatment. It is also noteworthy that the improvement in the placebo group, by 57% in the first week and 35% at the end of the second week, as reported by <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> is not dissimilar to that seen in <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> with children given placebo (34% in five to seven days).</P>
<P>A potential criticism of studies included in this review is that silent gastro-oesophageal reflux and sinusitis were not thoroughly investigated. In adults with gastro-oesophageal reflux (but no respiratory symptoms) reflux was found to be a cofactor and not the cause of cough (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 1995</LINK>). However, in children there is no evidence that clearly links gastro-oesophageal reflux to non-specific cough; hence this is highly unlikely to be a confounding factor. Although chronic sinusitis is believed to be a contributing factor for some adults with chronic cough, this would not be seen in young children where sinuses are not well developed. Symptoms of facial pain would be expected in older children, precluding the diagnosis of non-specific cough. However, a prospective study of 137 children, younger than 13 years, with computerised tomography sinus scans found that 50% had asymptomatic sinus inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Diament-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diament 1987</LINK>). The significance of this in relation to non-specific cough is not known.</P>
<P>One of the most important observations made in the studies included in this review is that children improved on placebo. Of those who were followed up, most remained better. Since follow up was six months to one year after the study this could simply reflect the natural history of the tendency of cough to improve with time (<LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The doses used in the Davies study should not cause irreversible side effects over a two-week period but these dosages may well have caused cortisol suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agertoft 1997</LINK>). Prolonged prescribing at this dosage could have adverse effects on growth and is certainly not warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>While cough is associated with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1975</LINK>), when no other evidence of airway obstruction is present it has been shown that beclomethasone dipropionate given at moderate doses provides no advantage over placebo in reducing the frequency of cough measured objectively or scored subjectively irrespective of the presence, or not, of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). We conclude, in children with recurrent cough without other evidence of airway obstruction, beclomethasone dipropionate given at low doses should not be used. It has been shown that a two-week course of very high off-license doses of inhaled fluticasone propionate may have a positive effect on the non-specific cough of some children. However, spontaneous improvement is often seen and high doses of corticosteroids are known to cause adrenal suppression. It is also uncertain how long any potential benefit would be maintained after treatment. Without a more complete understanding of benefits and adverse effects of very high-dose inhaled corticosteroids these cannot be recommended.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High-dose inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to make some limited impact in non-specific persistent nocturnal cough. Further research into the long-term benefit and potential harm from this intervention may be of interest. There is a need for more detailed study of cough response in persistent, isolated cough as it might one day lead to more effective treatments being trailed. Questions continue to be raised as to the interaction between cough receptors and inhaled irritants or allergens and the associated inflammatory response. Exploring these issues, however, may prove challenging in children where invasive sampling is difficult to justify in a condition that is not life threatening. The application of non-invasive methods for assessing the function of the lower airways in non-specific cough should continue to be explored. It may also be beneficial to consider the argument of nature versus nurture. With increased understanding of human genetics, it may be that studies aimed at understanding genetic predisposition to cough would prove informative. Non-specific cough is a common condition. An increased awareness of its impact on the child, their development and their family would assist in continuing to promote the importance of research into this area. As non-specific cough often improves spontaneously, if therapies are sought, lack of significant potential harm would seem essential if they are one day to be recommended. </P>
