<P>
<B>Background and review question</B>
<BR/>Fungal infection of the cornea occurs rarely in higher income countries but is relatively common in lower income countries. If left untreated the cornea may develop a hole and this may lead to blindness. Although there are a number of medications available, it is not clear which is the most effective and cost-effective. Our review question was: which is the best treatment for fungal infection of the cornea (fungal keratitis)?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that included 981 people; the evidence is current up to March 2015. The trials were mainly conducted in India.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The studies were small and many of them were at risk of bias. They also looked at different treatments. This meant that for most treatments we could not draw any conclusions as to which was better. There was one exception. Three trials (434 participants) compared topical natamycin and topical voriconazole. In these trials there was low quality evidence that people receiving topical natamycin were more likely to be cured and were more likely to have better vision three months after treatment started. There was high quality evidence that people receiving natamycin were less likely to develop a hole in the cornea and need a transplant. We did not find any evidence on quality of life. One trial found evidence that natamycin was particularly good when treating a particular type of fungal infection (<I>Fusarium</I> species).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-25 11:30:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two review authors selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was clinical cure at two to three months.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-26 09:42:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials in this review; 10 trials were conducted in India, one in Bangladesh and one in Egypt. Seven of these trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, two of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. Participants were randomised to the following comparisons: topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 1% voriconazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 2% econazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%); topical 1% voriconazole compared to intrastromal voriconazole 50 g/0.1 mL (both treatments combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% voriconazole combined with oral voriconazole compared to both oral voriconazole and oral itraconazole (both combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% itraconazole compared to topical 1% itraconazole combined with oral itraconazole; topical amphotericin B compared to topical amphotericin B combined with subconjunctival injection of fluconazole; intracameral injection of amphotericin B with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone (severe fungal ulcers); topical 0.5% and 1% silver sulphadiazine compared to topical 1% miconazole. Overall the results were inconclusive because for most comparisons only one small trial was available. The exception was the comparison of topical natamycin and topical voriconazole for which three trials were available. In one of these trials clinical cure (healed ulcer) was reported in all 15 people allocated to natamycin and in 14/15 people allocated to voriconazole (risk ratio (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.28, low quality evidence). In one trial people randomised to natamycin were more likely to have a microbiological cure at six days (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants). On average, people randomised to natamycin had better spectacle-corrected visual acuity at two to three months compared to people randomised to voriconazole but the estimate was uncertain and the 95% confidence intervals included 0 (no difference) (mean difference -0.12 logMAR, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.06, 434 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence) and a decreased risk of corneal perforation or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, or both (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94, 434 participants, high quality evidence). There was inconclusive evidence on time to clinical cure. Compliance with treatment and quality of life were not reported. One trial comparing natamycin and voriconazole found the effect of treatment greater in <I>Fusarium</I> species, but this subgroup analysis was not prespecified by this review.</P>

<P>The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered. There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers. Future research should evaluate treatment effects according to fungus species.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-26 11:09:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fungal infections can involve different parts of the eye and periocular tissues including the lacrimal apparatus, conjunctiva, eyelids and bony orbit. The most common sites for fungal infections of the eye involve the cornea and the retina or vitreous (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Brien-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Brien 1997</LINK>). In the past few decades there have been increased reports of fungal infections of the eye (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Day-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Day 1996</LINK>). These can be mainly attributed to increased clinical awareness and improved laboratory techniques but may also have been caused by widespread use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs and ocular prosthetic devices (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Brien-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Brien 1997</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Fungal keratitis or keratomycosis is relatively uncommon in developed countries. There have been no high quality published reports on the incidence rates of the disease. In the United States, it has been reported that the total number of fungal keratitis cases annually is approximately 1500 (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Day-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Day 1996</LINK>). It is, however, more common in agricultural and tropical countries. In South Florida, a nine year survey from 1968 to 1977 revealed that 133 out of 633 cases of corneal ulcers were fungal in origin (<LINK REF="REF-Liesegang-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liesegang 1980</LINK>). In the Philippines, a 25 year survey on central microbial keratitis revealed a total of 430 cases (<LINK REF="REF-Valenton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valenton 2000</LINK>). The most common aetiologic agents are <I>Fusarium</I>, <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I> and <I>Aspergillus flavus</I>. In Hyderabad, India, a 10 year study on fungal keratitis showed 1352 culture proven cases; the most common aetiologic agents included <I>Fusarium</I>, <I>Aspergillus</I>, and <I>Curvularia spp</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gopinathan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gopinathan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common predisposing factor in fungal keratitis is trauma associated with plant material. Other risk factors include long-term corticosteroid use and immunocompromised patients (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Day-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Day 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Fungal infections almost always present in an insidious manner. The infection may be recognised within days or weeks and it is not uncommon for the traumatised epithelium to heal completely before signs of infection appear. During this latent period the patient may be asymptomatic. However, within a few days or weeks the patient might complain of discomfort, photophobia and discharge.</P>
<P>During this period, a persistent infiltrate at the site of previous superficial trauma is present which may increase in size and density in time. The epithelium tends to heal over this inflammatory focus, although there may be recurrent episodes of epithelial breakdown. The cornea becomes slightly thickened and 'satellite' lesions may develop peripheral to the focal area of infiltration.</P>
<P>If not treated, the inflammatory signs gradually progress causing permanent breakdown of the epithelium, stromal ulceration, or formation of descemetocoele (corneal thinning). The cornea may eventually perforate. Neovascularisation may occur as a result of inflammation, which may lead to severe scarring of the cornea. Associated signs indicating the severity of inflammation include the presence of hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber) and ciliary injection. Fungi can invade the deep stroma with great rapidity and may gain access to the anterior chamber.</P>
<P>It is important to determine the aetiologic agent of the corneal ulcer. Combined infections with bacteria and fungi or even with multiple fungi might occur. Diagnosis is usually achieved by scraping material from the base of the ulcer. Some of this material is stained for fungi and bacteria, the rest is cultured on solid and liquid media. In severe cases where diagnosis is unclear it may be necessary to take a larger corneal biopsy.</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-26 10:57:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Management of fungal keratitis is mainly by antifungal agents. Keratoplasty or corneal transplant is usually reserved for acute management of corneal perforation and for visual rehabilitation following corneal scarring.</P>
<P>The number of antifungal agents available for therapy is few compared with the number of pathogens capable of infecting the eye (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Brien-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Brien 1997</LINK>). Current antifungal agents are divided into four groups: polyenes, imidazoles, triazoles and fluorinated pyrimidines. These drugs can be administered topically, intravenously or orally. Topical antifungals can cause toxicity such as punctate keratitis, chemosis recurrent corneal epithelial erosions and conjunctival injection. Subconjunctival injections are quite painful and ulceration and necrosis of the conjunctival epithelium may occur.</P>
<P>Current practice in the treatment of fungal keratitis involves the use of topical antifungal drops such as natamycin and topical amphotericin B. Newly discovered triazoles such as voriconazole and posaconazole are also being studied as treatment for fungal keratitis (<LINK REF="REF-Galarreta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galarreta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tu 2007</LINK>). In developing countries, where the incidence of fungal keratitis is higher, the costs and availability of these polyene drops may be an issue. Hence, various studies have been performed to validate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine drops as an inexpensive alternative to the treatment of fungal keratitis (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1996</LINK>). Combination therapy using several antifungal drugs has been studied. The concomitant use of corticosteroids and antifungal agents remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Brien-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Brien 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In India, due to unavailability and high price of antifungal drugs, different antiseptic agents were studied in vitro and revealed a good dose response for chlorhexidine gluconate while povidone iodine showed a good response in all concentrations (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1996</LINK>). This initial study was then followed by a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to further determine the clinical effectiveness of chlorhexidine in confirmed fungal keratitis patients (<LINK REF="STD-Rahman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-26 10:57:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antifungal medications such as the polyenes work by binding to the ergosterol in the cell membrane of the fungal organism. Likewise, imidazoles affect the plasma membrane formation by affecting the ergosterol through microsomal P-450 enzyme. Pyrimidines are transformed to fluorouracil in the cell, therefore blocking thymidine synthesis (<LINK REF="STD-Mabon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mabon 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-21 12:34:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The gold standard for treatment of fungal keratitis has not been identified. Due to the low incidence of the disease it is difficult to perform large trials, especially in developed countries. A systematic review of available trials will, therefore, contribute to the evidence base.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-19 22:29:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of the risk of bias of studies was undertaken in accordance with the methods given in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Both review authors independently assessed the studies and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following bias domains were considered: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, selective outcome reporting. Assessment was based on the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment): was the sequence of allocation of participants to groups randomly generated and concealed until after treatments were allocated?</LI>
<LI>Performance bias (masking of participants and researchers): were the recipients of care unaware of their assigned treatment? Were persons providing care unaware of the assigned treatment?</LI>
<LI>Detection bias: were persons assessing outcome unaware of the assigned treatment?</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias: were rates of follow up similar in the comparison groups? Was the analysis 'intention-to-treat' (were all participants analysed as randomised)?</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: were all outcomes reported?</LI>
</OL>
<P>We assessed each parameter as 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear'. We contacted trialists for clarification of any parameter graded as unclear.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-03-19 20:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible, we did an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, using imputed data if computed by the trial investigators using an appropriate method. We did not impute missing data ourselves. </P>
<P>For most studies, ITT data were not available and we did an available case analysis. This assumes that data are missing at random. We assessed whether this assumption was reasonable by collecting data from each included trial on the number of participants excluded or lost to follow up and reasons for loss to follow up by treatment group, if reported.</P>

<P>We examined the overall characteristics of the studies, in particular the type of participants and types of interventions, to assess the extent to which the studies were similar enough to make pooling study results sensible.</P>
<P>We looked at the forest plots of study results to see how consistent the results of the studies are, in particular looking at the size and direction of effects.</P>
<P>We calculated I<SUP>2 </SUP>which is the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We considered I<SUP>2 </SUP>values over 50% to indicate substantial inconsistency but also considered Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P value.

<P>Contact with first authors of identified trials and searching the reference lists of these studies failed to identify any additional trials. We also approached pharmaceutical companies producing antifungal agents but there was no information on additional trials.</P>
<P>Update searches were done in January 2007 and Februrary 2010. The searches yielded a total of 206 and 23 references, respectively.

<P>A further update search was done in August 2011. After deduplication the search identified a total of 50 references. The TSC scanned the search results and removed 41 references which were not relevant to the scope of the review. We reviewed the remaining nine references of which five were published reports of studies and four were reports of ongoing studies. We assessed the five published reports of studies for potential inclusion in the review.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-04-08 14:57:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review aimed to provide a critical, quantitative overview of previous clinical research, and to yield, where possible, summary effect measures with increased statistical power by combining multiple small clinical trials. The current review includes 12 trials comparing different antifungal drugs in topical drops, ointment and oral preparations for the treatment of fungal keratitis. All trials were done in lower income countries (mainly India) since the incidence is greater there compared to higher income countries such as the United States. There are still no large multicentre randomised trials on the treatment of fungal keratitis.</P>
<P>Eight antifungal agents, namely: voriconazole, econazole, itraconazole, miconazole, natamycin, amphotericin B, chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulphadiazine were studied. The latter two are not part of the conventional drugs which act on the hyphal cell membranes. The use of alternative drugs such as chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulphadiazine may indicate that conventional drugs are not always available, are expensive and ineffective. Since fungal keratitis is more common in lower income countries the use of inexpensive alternative drugs is promising. In addition, pharmaceutical companies have less financial incentive to invest in the development of ocular antifungal agents. The only commercially available antifungal drug in the United States in ophthalmic form is natamycin (Natacyn 5% by Alcon Laboratories). In Asia and Africa, Natacyn is given as a service drug but with limited availability. In India, topical natamycin is manufactured by a local pharmaceutical company, however, no clinical trials have been done on this drug.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-20 11:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered so there is little good evidence for most comparisons reported in this review. The exception is the comparison between natamycin and voriconazole (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers and some evidence that this effect particularly applies to<I> Fusarium </I>species.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-21 13:54:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence supporting the treatment of fungal keratitis appears to be weak. Only 12 trials of variable quality were identified. The trials considered different preparations and comparisons and so for most comparisons it was either not possible or not useful to pool the data.</P>
<P>Most participants included in this review belonged to studies that compared natamycin and voriconazole. There was no study related to the medical treatment of yeast infection.</P>
<P>The most important study (<LINK REF="STD-MUTT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MUTT 2010</LINK>) did not provide any information on clinical cure or time to clinical cure. The hazard ratio of re-epithelialization may not give a true picture since re-epithelization can still take place in the presence of underlying stromal infiltrate.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-26 08:43:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general the quality of the evidence included in this review was low: trials were at risk of bias and were underpowered; only two of the comparisons had more than one trial and no comparison had more than three trials contributing data. The exception is for the comparison of natamycin and voriconazole, specifically for the outcome corneal perforation, where there was high quality evidence from three trials that natamycin achieved better outcomes than voriconazole (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-08 14:57:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original protocol for this review was first published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-FlorCruz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FlorCruz 2003</LINK>). Since then recommended Cochrane review methods have changed considerably. The methods for this review have therefore been updated, in particular to include assessment of risk of bias and summary of findings tables but also refinement of the outcomes and methods for addressing heterogeneity and unit of analysis issues. However, the criteria for inclusion of studies and methods for data extraction have not changed. As there are few trials included for each comparison, and therefore key decisions have not been affected by these changes, we believe the evolution in methods in this review over time will not have biased the overall conclusions. See <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>For one analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) fixed- and random-effects models provide different results in terms of statistical significance (but similar results in terms of size of the effect). We have chosen to report the more conservative random effects model in the abstract and summary of findings table.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-21 13:55:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the trials on management of fungal keratitis gathered during the literature search are case series. We only included RCTs in this review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-08 14:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 15:22:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a variety of antifungal agents available for the treatment of fungal keratitis but the studies comparing them are of variable quality and generally underpowered. The results of these studies do not show significant clinical differences among the heterogeneous interventions, with the exception of the comparison between natamycin and voriconazole. People given natamycin had a lower risk of corneal perforation but there was less evidence to support an effect on the primary outcome of this review - clinical cure at two to three months.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-08 14:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for future multicentre RCTs of the interventions considered in this review that recruit enough numbers of participants to measure effects with appropriate precision. Future trials could consider subgroup analyses by type of fungal infection. The main outcome measures to be addressed should include clinical cure, visual acuity, serious adverse effects such as corneal perforation and patient reported outcome measures such as quality of life. Since the price of these drugs is likely to be prohibitive to patients in developing nations, cost-effectiveness should also be examined. The search for a cheaper and more effective treatment alternative to what has already been proposed still continues.</P>

<P>The methods have been updated since the protocol was originally published in line with developments in Cochrane methods. </P>
<P>The objectives and inclusion criteria (types of studies, types of participants and types of interventions) have stayed the same as specified in the orignal published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-FlorCruz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FlorCruz 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>For the current update we simplified and reduced the number of outcomes to make the review clearer and more relevant. We also specified the list of outcomes for the summary of findings table at this update. We did not consider the data available when making this selection but we were aware of the results of the published trials. </P>
<P>The new Cochrane risk of bias tool has been introduced since the protocol was written and this has been implemented in this review. We have added in some more detail on unit of analysis issues, dealing with missing data and assessment of reporting biases that were not considered at the protocol stage. Plans for data synthesis remain the same as the protocol. We have included one subgroup analysis for future updates (type of fungal infection) and removed one sensitivity analysis ("changing inclusion criteria such as lowering methodological cut-off points") because we felt that on reflection this was taken care of by the sensitivity analysis of risk of bias.</P>

<P>Potential participants were treated with topical natamycin every hour round the clock for 2 days and every 2 hours thereafter along with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride 0.3% every 6 hours and cycloplegics. People with ulcers<BR/>with an increase in size of epithelial defect, a decrease of less than 20% of stromal infiltrate or scar complex, or increasing hypopyon were enrolled. Both groups were treated with 5% Natamycin drops four times per day, 0.3% Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride drops 4 times per day and 2% homatropine drops 3 times per day.</P>
<P>Topical voriconazole 1% was applied every hour for the first 48 hours. Topical voriconazole 1% eye drops were prepared in the Department of Ocular Pharmacology by reconstituting injection voriconazole 200 mg powder (VORAZE; Sun Pharma, Mumbai, India) in 19 mL Ringer lactate. The drops were tapered to every 2 hours while awake for 72 hours and then the dose was applied every 4 hours. Further tapering of the drug depended on the response of the infection to treatment and the clinician&#8217;s judgment.</P>
<P>Instrastromal injections 50 g/0.1 mL intrastromal voriconazole. VORAZE 200 mg powder (Sun Pharma, Mumbai, India) was reconstituted with 19 mL Ringer lactate. 1 mL of this solution was diluted further with 20 mL Ringer lactate. The resulting 0.5 mg/mL (50 g/0.1 mL) solution was used for the intrastromal injection. All injections were given in an operating room under aseptic precautions after administering peribulbar anaesthesia. After loading the drug into a 1 mL tuberculin syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle, it was inserted obliquely into the cornea from the uninvolved, clear area to reach just flush to the ulcer at the midstromal level in each case. 5 divided doses were given around the ulcer to form a deposit of the drug around the circumference of the lesion. This was done in such a manner that the injected drug appeared to encompass the ulcer along each meridian. At least 3 injections were given 72 hours apart.</P>
<P>Participants in both groups received topical therapy with 5% natamycin every 4 hours, cycloplegics, and 0.3% ciprofloxacin hydrochloride every 6 hours.</P>
