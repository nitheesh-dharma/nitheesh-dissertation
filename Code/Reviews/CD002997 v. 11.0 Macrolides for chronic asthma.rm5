I have made some minor amendments in response to the analysis queries. Kayleigh, can you please check these before re-publishing? A summary of changes is listed below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I have added the Hahn 2006 reference to your QoL results section (to indicate the fifth study c.f. the four listed studies for symptoms)&lt;br&gt;KK: Happy with this and have accepted the change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- SoF table outcome 2 - amended the N for symptom scales, please review.&lt;br&gt;KK: I have rejected this change. As per the footnote in the symptom scales analysis, Amayasu 2000 is a crossover study with 17 participants so the participant numbers displayed (although not affecting the analysis) are somewhat misleading. 139 is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC stats check 6 May 2015. This is fine to proceed as I have checked the data previously (for FEV1 in particular)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W notes 21/04/2015&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report data for all the primary outcomes in the abstract &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have added everything in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also report adverse effects (described as side effects in this review), include a statement that not fully reported if need be. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Serious adverse events are in there, and I have added a statement about specific side effects.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Along with Giovanni's additions, I have also been through the background to try and bring it together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;description of the condition: &amp;quot;allergic patients.&amp;quot; is this precise enough? Is it people with allergies and asthma or people who are atopic? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GF: Atopic, now clear in the text.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Description of the condition: If the onset of asthma is later in adult life, it may be more severe and require aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment. - is it right to say aggressive ani-inflams? Agressive is a loaded word which we don't normally use. The implication that children tend to have mild asthma when adults have severe asthma; is that right?&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; GF: This sounded a little confounding to the readers. I rephrased the sentence explaining the different severity grades, it should be clearer now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Desription of the condition: asthma therapy is based on anti-inflams... This is not precise, and it's confusing because the first step in treatment for most with asthma is a SABA which work as bronchodilators rather than anti-inflammatory &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GF: Rephrased it with the precious point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;write out the abbreviation in full the first time it appears &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Giovanni and I have both been through to do this - hope we haven't missed any&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the intervention might work. This section seems incomplete. Add a sentence to the end of each paragraph to state how these 2 mechanisms improve symptoms. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GF: added as recommended.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cochrane is drafting a policy on antibiotic resistance. Consider adding a paragraph on antibiotic resistance here (I'll send you the paper separately) &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GF: thanks for suggesting this important point, a sentence is now added in the background, in the discussion and in the implication for practice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;not sure what the following means: &amp;quot;lowest corticosteroid dose in steroid-requiring asthmatic patient&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Giovanni, I think I know what this is getting at but can you think of a better way of wording it? GF: Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have changed this to &amp;quot;Lowest tolerated oral corticosteroid dose (in patients requiring oral corticosteroids at baseline)&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;types of studies - I removed the part about double blind studies being preferred as this has no meaning since double blind, single blind and unblinded studies were eligible. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Thanks, fine with that.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;types of studies - language was not an exclusion criteria, so I have deleted it. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Again, fine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;included studies &amp;quot;Three studies investigated the role of macrolides in patients with evidence of &lt;i&gt;C. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;M. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; infection, based on serological (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Black 2001&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Black 2001&lt;/a&gt;) or molecular (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Kraft 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Kraft 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Sutherland 2010&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sutherland 2010&lt;/a&gt;) methods.&amp;quot; what about the other studies? Were those participants infected with unknown microbes? &lt;b&gt;GF: &lt;i&gt;Added a sentence providing info that co-infection status was unknown in the other studies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blood sputum eosinophils and serum and sputum ECP - add the pooled treatment effect in the text &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Thanks for catching this, I&amp;#8217;ve added them in with the exception of sputum eosinophils because we didn't pool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bullet three - I don't really understand this. What do you mean by 'home-made'? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have changed to non-validated&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apart from symptom score in &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Amayasu 2000&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Amayasu 2000&lt;/a&gt;, enrolling patients..... is the purpose of this paragraph to highlight positive results? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: This is actually in the discussion &amp;#8211; Giovanni? No, this was to highlight the fact that the patients enrolled in Amayasu and Shoji are really not fully comparable with the others, as they are intermittent asthma. We did not have this as an exclusion criteria; I just wanted to point out that the effect of macrolides in these patients is really of no use. I re-phrased the sentence, Kayleigh see if it is clear otherwise we can just delete it to avoid confusion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have rephrased and cut down a lot of the discussion, especially under completeness and applicability of the evidence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first 2 paragraphs may fit better in the background? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GF: This was actually a repetition of the rationale for the use of macrolides, already reported in the background session; the paragraph was significantly shorted; it is just to introduce the discussion, can be removed if considered redundant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;potential biases in the review process: It's a bit of a contradiction to decide not to contact authors because the trials are old and you assume you won't get an answer, and then suggest this be done in a future update which is going to make the time lag even greater and further reduce the chance to geta reply - this update has taken over 2 years to do! &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Yes, very fair, I have taken out the second bit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;agreements and disagreements - suggest to add a brief sentence which compares/contrasts those reviews with this review &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have reworded a bit about Reitner. Giovanni, can you please add a sentence to compare the Tong results with our own? Done, please see if my judgment is not too &amp;#8220;strong&amp;#8221; (KK checked and reworded some parts)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sudden mention of 'difficult to control asthma' - which was not an inclusion criteria and none of the participants were described in the review as having this phenotype? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Good point, I have amended to chronic as per the title and inclusion criteria (in abstract and discussion conclusions) - the conclusions have been reworded more generally&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;analysis 1.10 BHR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did extensive formatting to reduce the amount of text and make it easier to read &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Many thanks, Emma. I have accepted the changes and tidied a bit more too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add all abbreviations to the table where they first appear. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have done most of this but can you please add any I have missed, and Giovanni also added some&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Sutherland, you've added the N. You either need to add the N for all studies, or delete this one. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have taken out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;consider using BHR as abbreviation for bronchial hyperresponsiveness throughout table &lt;b&gt;KK: Done, thanks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've edited this in tracked changes. Check carefully before accepting &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: all good, thank you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add abbreviations meanings to the footnotes - I have added the abbreviations you used... &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Thanks again, Emma. Giovanni also added some&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newsom 1993 - does TAO mean troleandomycin? if so, spell out in full. Did you mean Pd20 instead of P20?&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;KK: Yes, I have amended. Also in the footnotes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;characteristics if excluded studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cogo 1994. Two of the items listed are not valid reasons for exclusion so could be deleted. Study duration is fine though. Ditto Itkin 1970 &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Thanks &amp;#8211; I think they're all ok now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gotfired 2004. The reason was unclear - I think it was because there was no between study comparison. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Thanks for changing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Koh 1997 - if all patients have bronchiectasis (so that the people with asthma has co-existing bronchiectasis) then it's fine to exclude. If the study was on some people with asthma and some with bronchiectasis, then this should be an included study - even if there is no useable data because it was not reported separately. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK:I have added a bit more detail to clarify&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOF table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how were the outcomes selected for inclusion in the SOF? &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Just through discussion since GRADE wasn&amp;#8217;t in the original protocol or the previous versions. We tried to get a good spread of the outcomes, and chose to leave out bronchial hyperresponsiveness both because it is not really a patient important outcome and the results were so bizarre. The steroid dose one (also in the original primary list) didn&amp;#8217;t make the cut&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; either. I have added a footnote to mention these two.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;consider adding more information about the macrolides or doses used to the &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; in the description of the PICO &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: Good suggestion, I have done so.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delete table 2 as it is not a synthesis of the results and is duplication of information found elsewhere in the review &lt;b&gt;GF: It gives some more information than characteristics of included studies and description in the text of the review; I would prefer to keep this table, but it&amp;#8217;s up to the editorial office.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;KK: I have moved to the appendix and changed the links in the text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL email to GF 091204&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Gianni,&lt;br&gt;I hope that you agree to the changes I have made - in case you don't I have retained the old review in case! All the changes to the text of the review are in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I have converted all previous crossover data to generic inverse variance outcome (please see the new data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I have extracted additional data from Black 201, Kostadima 2004 and Kraft 2002 for analysis (although not pooled them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Crucially, I have changed a few things in the text to make the review readable in its current form, but I have retained the detail of the previous version you sent to me: Additional tables now contain the very thorough summary of the trials that you wrote up (both in terms of their design and their findings). In their place in the text of the review I have provided a summary of the trials under Description of Studies, and also a shortened draft of the Results section. In both instances I have referenced the additional table with your detail of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that these changes are OK. If so I will submit the review to Peter Gibson so that he knows of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-05-17 10:57:37 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="MAC-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-13 13:07:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Main point:</B> Studies do not show that macrolides are better than placebo for most outcomes. There may be a benefit on symptom scales and lung function but the latter depends on how this is measured. The evidence was very low quality so we can't rule out the possibility of other benefits or harms.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Asthma is a chronic disease in which inflammation of the airways leads to coughing, wheezing and breathing problems. There are probably different reasons for this inflammation and why it persists, and these may require different treatments. Infection in the lungs may be one cause, and macrolides are a type of antibiotic that may be used long-term as a way of improving symptoms for these people.</P>
<P>
<B>How we answered the question</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for studies on adults or children with asthma who were either given a macrolide or placebo for at least four weeks to see if it improved their symptoms and made it less likely for them to have an asthma attack, often referred to as an 'exacerbation'. We carried out our most recent search for studies in April 2015. After finding all of the relevant studies, we pulled out information about asthma attacks requiring hospital admission, asthma attacks that needed to be treated with oral steroids, symptom scales, asthma control, quality of life, several measures of lung function, the need for rescue inhalers, serious side effects and measures of asthma activity in blood and sputum.</P>
<P>
<B>What we found</B>
</P>
<P>We found 23 studies, including 16 new ones that had been published since the last search was done in 2007. Overall, just over 1500 people received either macrolide or placebo. There were a lot of problems in the way studies were described and how well they reported data, which made us consider the evidence to be very low quality, undermining our confidence in most of the results. The studies were quite different from each other, for example in the severity of people's asthma, the type of macrolide they were given and the length of the treatment period.</P>
<P>Our review did not show that macrolides were better than placebo for most of the important outcomes we looked at. However, they may have some benefits on symptom scales and lung function, and we cannot rule out the possibility that they are helpful for some people or that they cause harm. There were no reports of serious side effects of macrolides, but 16 studies didn't say whether or not any occurred.</P>

<P>Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, randomising a total of 1513 participants to receive macrolide or placebo. The quality of evidence was generally very low due to incomplete reporting of study methodology and clinical data, suspected publication bias, indirectness of study populations, risk of bias and imprecision (because of small numbers of patients and events). Most of the included studies reported data from patients with persistent or severe asthma, but inclusion criteria, interventions and outcomes were highly variable.</P>
<P>Macrolides were not found to be better than placebo for the majority of clinical outcomes including exacerbations requiring hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 7.23; participants = 143; studies = 2; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) or at least treatment with oral steroids (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.57; participants = 290; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The evidence on asthma control (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.15), quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24) and rescue medication use (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.12) was all of very low quality and did not show a benefit of macrolide treatment. There was some evidence that macrolides led to some improvement on symptom scales (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.02), and in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>): MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14), although not on all the measures we assessed. Measures of bronchial hyperresponsiveness were too varied to pool, but most studies showed no clear benefit of macrolide over placebo. Two studies recruiting people taking regular oral corticosteroids suggested macrolides may have a steroid-sparing effect in this population. Macrolides were well tolerated with respect to severe adverse events, although less than half of the studies reported the outcome (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.68; participants = 434; studies = 7; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Reporting of specific side effects was too patchy across studies to analyse meaningfully. As already reported in the previous versions of the systematic review, biomarkers of asthma activity, such as sputum and serum level of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or sputum and serum eosinophils, were lower in patients treated with macrolides, but this was not associated with clinical benefits.</P>
<P>Two within-study subgroup analyses showed a possible benefit of macrolides for non-eosinophilic asthma, but it was not possible to investigate this further using the data available for this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-05-13 13:07:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Existing evidence does not show macrolides to be better than placebo for the majority of clinical outcomes. However, they may have a benefit on symptom scales and some measures of lung function, and we cannot rule out the possibility of other benefits or harms because the evidence is of very low quality due to heterogeneity among patients and interventions, imprecision and reporting biases.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The review highlights the need for researchers to report clinically relevant outcomes accurately and completely using guideline definitions of exacerbations and validated scales. The possible benefit of macrolides in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma based on subgroup analyses in two of the included studies may require further investigation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-15 14:09:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-15 14:09:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways characterised by chronic inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and paroxysmal attacks of wheezing. It affects people of every age, but frequently the disease occurs in childhood, especially in those who are atopic. There are different phenotypes of the disease, including one that recognises infection as an important factor in airway inflammation. Current guidelines recommend tailoring asthma treatment according to a stepwise approach, considering severity of symptoms and response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Short-acting bronchodilators are usually effective in controlling intermittent asthma, but persistent asthma may require anti-inflammatory drugs, longer-acting bronchodilators, or both. These are usually administered directly to the lungs via inhalation or orally with the aim of improving respiratory symptoms by reducing airways inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2014</LINK>). More recent therapies include anti-leukotrienes in mild-to-moderate asthma, humanised antibodies such as omalizumab, immunosuppressive drugs and inhibitors of specific pathways, which are used only in severe, treatment-resistant asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olin 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-09 16:28:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Macrolides are a class of antibiotics that are widely used in the treatment of various infectious diseases, including respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Elcoro-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Elcoro 1999</LINK>). The first studies on macrolides in patients with asthma suggested a steroid-sparing effect (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>), while more recent reports have demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect of this class of antibiotics, whereby macrolides seem to decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness associated with eosinophilic inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>). Macrolides are effective in the long-term treatment of cystic fibrosis, diffuse panbronchiolitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and they are not associated with an increased risk of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Cai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cai 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spagnolo-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spagnolo 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, a potential drawback of longer-term antibiotic use for asthma is the development of bacterial resistance by strains that normally colonise the airways. Macrolide use in healthy volunteers led to pharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant streptococci (<LINK REF="REF-Malhotra_x002d_Kumar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malhotra-Kumar 2007</LINK>), which is of particular concern for the wider community.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-15 14:09:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Macrolides have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may improve asthma symptoms in two ways: by reducing airways inflammation directly and by controlling intracellular infection, which may trigger and maintain inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 1998</LINK>). Their anti-inflammatory potential has been linked to their action on pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause inflammation, which was highlighted by the results of the previous versions of this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Richeldi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richeldi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richeldi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richeldi 2005</LINK>). In vivo and in vitro studies of human and animal models have demonstrated that macrolides suppress the production of cytokines such as interleukins and inhibit the neutrophil adhesion to epithelial cells, the respiratory burst of neutrophils and the secretion of mucus from human airways (<LINK REF="REF-Adachi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adachi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konno-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konno 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koyama-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koyama 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential benefit of their antimicrobial action for people with asthma was suggested after observational studies identified intracellular bacterial infection (i.e. <I>Chlamydophilia pneumoniae</I> or <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae)</I> as a possible trigger of bronchial inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Kraft-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gencay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gencay 2001</LINK> subsequently demonstrated that people with asthma had a higher frequency of <I>C. pneumoniae </I>antibodies than matched controls. Longitudinal studies showed no clear effect of infection with <I>C. pneumoniae</I> on the incidence of asthma, but patients who had an infection and developed asthma showed a faster decline in lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Pasternack-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasternack 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, in children with asthma, <I>M. pneumoniae</I> detection in respiratory samples was associated with poorer asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2013</LINK>). Recent studies in animal models seems to point out an important role of the infection with <I>C. pneumoniae </I>in the early phases of life in the pathogenesis of severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Essilfie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essilfie 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansbro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansbro 2014</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-01 17:02:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">

<P>Each potential source of bias was graded as high, low or unclear and justified with a quote from the study report in the 'Risk of bias' table.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-09-01 17:03:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect. We narratively described skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges. We analysed data from cross-over trials using generic inverse variance (GIV). We pooled results from cross-over trials and parallel trials. Where raw data and adjusted analyses (e.g. accounting for baseline differences) were presented in the same trial, we used the latter.</P>
<P>We undertook meta-analyses only where meaningful, that is, if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.</P>
<P>Where multiple trial arms were reported in a single trial, we included only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) were combined in the same meta-analysis, we halved the control group to avoid double-counting.</P>
<P>If change from baseline and endpoint scores were available for continuous data, we used change from baseline unless the majority of studies reported endpoint scores. If a study reported outcomes at multiple time points, we used the end-of-study measurement.</P>
<P>When both an analysis using only participants who completed the trial and an analysis that imputed data for participants who were randomised but did not provide endpoint data (e.g. last observation carried forward) were available, we used the latter.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we used participants rather than events as the unit of analysis (i.e. number of adults admitted to hospital rather than number of admissions per adult).

All participants had an asthma diagnosis, which was generally established according to the guidelines in use at the time of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2010</LINK>); these are similar to the current international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies assessed the effects of macrolide treatment in paediatric asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piacentini-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Piacentini 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>), and the rest recruited asthma patients over the age of 18 years. The studies varied according to <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2014</LINK> criteria for asthma severity, and often there was very little information about baseline severity.</P>
<P>Most studies included participants with persistent mild-to-severe asthma, while one included participants with intermittent asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>), and one used patients with aspirin-induced intermittent asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies investigated the role of macrolides in patients with evidence of <I>C. pneumoniae</I> or <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection, based on serological (<LINK REF="STD-Black-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2001</LINK>) or molecular (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>) methods.

<P>Seven studies considered exacerbations (requiring hospitalisation or emergency room (ER) visit/systemic steroids) as an outcome, but the definition of 'severe' exacerbation was variable and sometimes unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brusselle-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brusselle 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostadima-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kostadima 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK> did not include exacerbations as an outcome but explicitly confirmed that the Chinese studies did not report this outcome either. Data from these studies only contributed to one meta-analysis (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). We narratively summarised data that could not be meta-analysed for the relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>Most studies reported measures of symptoms, asthma control or quality of life, but the analyses were limited by the way data were reported and by the scales that could be reasonably pooled in meta-analysis. We did not consider a meta-analysis of all these measures to be valid or the subsequent results to be interpretable in any meaningful way, so we chose only to meta-analyse those that we knew to be similar. Standardised mean difference had to be used for the 'symptom scale' meta-analysis, which still made the effect and its precision difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>Four studies reported data about change in rescue medication as puffs per day in a way that could be included in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Brusselle-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brusselle 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the studies reported measures of lung function such as FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, forced vital capacity (FVC) or PEF, but only six reported data for the same measure that could be pooled. There were some issues with selective reporting that prevented studies from being included in the analyses, such as data only being presented graphically or without a measure of variance (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Black-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2001</LINK>). It was often unclear when the measures were taken, (i.e. pre- or post-bronchodilator), but when the information was available, we recorded it in the analysis footnotes. <LINK REF="STD-Brusselle-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brusselle 2013</LINK> reported percentage FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, but their data could not be combined with the other studies, which reported the outcome in litres. We combined the data made available to us from <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK> for <LINK REF="STD-He-2009" TYPE="STUDY">He 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2008</LINK>, but we performed a sensitivity analysis without them due to our uncertainties about which measures were used and the unclear risk of bias. We were also provided with data for peak flow for <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2008</LINK>, but the data were a different order of magnitude to the other studies, and it did not make sense to pool them.</P>
<P>Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was considered in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostadima-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kostadima 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piacentini-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Piacentini 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>) but there was a lot of variation in the measures used and the way the data were reported, which meant it was not possible to meta-analyse the data. The raw data have been presented in a table with information about the measures used.</P>
<P>Adverse events were considered in most of the studies, but serious adverse events were only explicitly reported as an outcome in seven (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brusselle-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brusselle 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>). While it was not ideal to include the dichotomous cross-over data without adjusting them to account for matched pairs, no events were observed in <LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>, so it did not contribute to the pooled effect.</P>

<P>There was considerable uncertainty relating to study methodology due to insufficient reporting in the published reports. This was particularly true for the selection bias domains, but also for blinding of outcome assessment and attrition bias. We had concerns about incomplete and selective reporting of the results for most of the studies and generally considered there to be a high risk for publication bias because only a small number of studies reported data in a way that could be pooled in meta-analysis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-13 13:07:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-three studies, involving a total of 1513 participants given macrolide or placebo, met the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was generally very low due to incomplete reporting of study methodology and clinical data, suspected publication bias, indirectness of study populations, risk of bias and imprecision caused by small numbers of patients and events. Most of the included studies reported data from patients with persistent or severe asthma, but inclusion criteria, interventions and outcomes were highly variable.</P>
<P>For the most part, macrolides did not lead to better clinical outcomes than placebo, including for exacerbations requiring hospital admission (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.23; participants = 143; studies = 2; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) or treatment with oral steroids (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.57; participants = 290; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The evidence on asthma control (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.15), quality of life (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24), and rescue medication use (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.12) was all of very low quality and did not show a benefit of macrolide treatment. There was limited evidence that macrolides led to some improvement on symptom scales (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.02) and lung function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>: MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14), although not on all the measures we assessed. Measures of bronchial hyperresponsiveness were too varied to pool, but most studies showed no clear benefit of macrolide over placebo. Two studies recruiting people taking regular oral corticosteroids suggested macrolides may have a steroid-sparing effect in this population. Macrolides were well tolerated with respect to severe adverse events, although less than half of the studies reported the outcome (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.68; participants = 434; studies = 7; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Reporting of specific side effects was too patchy across studies to analyse meaningfully. As already reported in the previous versions of the systematic review, biomarkers of asthma activity such as sputum and serum ECP, sputum and serum eosinophils were lower in patients treated with macrolides, but this was not associated with clinical benefits.</P>
<P>Two within-study subgroup analyses showed a possible benefit of macrolides for non-eosinophilic asthma, but it was not possible to investigate this further using the data available for this review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-13 13:07:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data do not support any generalised use of macrolides in clinical practice to improve clinical outcomes in patients with persistent asthma, but we cannot rule out the possibility of benefit due to several shortcomings in the evidence base. The potential benefit of macrolides in selected phenotypes in particular (i.e. non-eosinophilic asthma) is not yet confirmed.</P>
<P>The interpretation of the available data from the 23 RCTs included in the present review are difficult to interpret for several reasons. Firstly, four different types of macrolides were used across the studies (roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and troleandomycin), often with differences in dosage and frequency of administration. Secondly, participants with different severities of asthma were included: the oldest studies included participants who were taking long-term oral steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>), which could reflect a severe population or outdated prescribing practice. One study included patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1999</LINK>), one included patients with intermittent allergic asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>), and another exclusively recruited smokers with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2012</LINK>); all the other studies enrolled patient with mild-to-severe persistent asthma, and we could not properly assess the patient populations of six Chinese studies. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Black-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>) tested participants for <I>C. pneumoniae </I>or<I> M. pneumoniae</I> infection, but all with different techniques and very different results. The scarcity of data in the primary analyses precluded any meaningful subgroup analyses to assess the possible effect of these factors.Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the outcomes measured were heterogeneous; reporting of exacerbations and definitions for severe exacerbations varied across the studies; asthma symptoms were recorded using a variety of non-validated scales as well as the ACQ and AQLQ, with a great variability across the studies. Lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were often assessed and reported using different methodologies or parameters.</P>
<P>Two studies showing some effect on symptoms and markers of eosinophil inflammation were unusual both in the participants they recruited and in their design. Both were cross-over studies, one recruiting patients with allergic intermittent asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Amayasu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amayasu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1999</LINK>), and the other enrolling patients whose asthma was aspirin-induced.</P>
<P>Only three studies investigated the role of macrolides in children with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piacentini-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Piacentini 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>); unfortunately the great variability in the interventions, measurements and outcomes makes any firm conclusion on the role of macrolides in children impossible. <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> suggested a potential role for troleandomycin as steroid-sparing agent, while <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK> seems instead to exclude any role of macrolides used in this way.</P>
<P>Despite these limitations, our systematic review and meta-analysis did not show a benefit of macrolides over placebo on rates of exacerbations, quality of life or participants' need for rescue medications. As discussed, this does not rule out the possibility for significant benefit or harm of macrolides given the shortcomings of the evidence described above, and there may be a small benefit on symptom scales and some measures of lung function. The results of this review might change if well-designed and appropriately powered RCTs are conducted, but at present the evidence is not promising enough to support further investigation in similar cohorts of patients. There is a suggestion that research targeted at specific phenotypes (i.e. non-eosinophilic asthma) may be warranted.</P>
<P>Antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern and only one included study investigated this (<LINK REF="STD-Brusselle-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brusselle 2013</LINK>), reporting that 87% of azithromycin-treated patients were colonised with erythromycin-resistant streptococci, a statistically significant increase from baseline and in comparison with the placebo group. These results suggest that spread of resistant strain is a real concern, and any further research should clearly measure and report resistance as an outcome. Alongside this, the case for macrolide therapy contributing to better outcomes in those testing positive for <I>C. pneumoniae</I> or <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection was mostly unconvincing (<LINK REF="STD-Belotserkovskaya-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belotserkovskaya 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strunk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strunk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2010</LINK>). The number of patients testing positive was much lower than expected in several studies, and subgroup analyses were often underpowered or post hoc.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-01 17:14:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence is very low. We had serious concerns about publication bias and underreporting or variation of study results; there was a lot of uncertainty regarding allocation procedures and blinding of outcome assessment, and all but three of the trials recruited fewer than 100 people.</P>
<P>We downgraded most of the analyses for publication bias because so few studies reported clinical data well enough to be included in meta-analysis. Some studies reported outcomes of interest but not in a format that allowed the data to be combined with other studies, and other studies focused on non-clinical outcomes when the use of macrolides was being tested to assess their mechanism of action and effect on biomarkers. Most outcomes were also downgraded for indirectness because some studies focused on specific populations, such as smokers or those with asthma of a particular severity, which varied across studies. Inconsistencies in the scales used or description of outcomes also made it difficult to meta-analyse the data and reduced our confidence in the conclusions that could be drawn. Risk of bias was also an issue across most of the analyses, largely due to uncertainty as a result of insufficient reporting of methodology, but also as a result of failure to prevent or account for high or unbalanced dropout.</P>
<P>Evidence for outcomes such as exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and serious adverse events was very imprecise due to the length of the studies and the rarity of this sort of events, so it was difficult to reach meaningful conclusions for these outcomes. For other outcomes such as symptoms, quality of life and FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, the reporting made it difficult for us to assess the amount of variation in scales, properties, time of measurement, etc., and this uncertainty made the data difficult to interpret.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-10 15:14:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not contact most trial authors to obtain unpublished data or to clarify methodology. Only nine of the studies were conducted in the last five years, and seven were conducted over 10 years ago. We judged that the time taken to contact all authors and the anticipated low response rate due to study age would delay the publication of this update.</P>
<P>We found six studies listed in an existing systematic review conducted in China (<LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK>) that did not appear in our searches. While we did not limit our searches by language, they did not cover studies that are indexed in non-English language databases. Since the <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK> systematic review was published in English, we were able to contact the authors and extract sufficient information to confirm the eligibility of these trials. However, we did not have the resources to personally extract data or assess for risk of bias in these studies, and the information we were able to include were kindly provided by the authors of that systematic review and not directly from the studies themselves. The review authors were able to answer questions we had about outcomes the studies and their outcomes, but these studies could not be assessed as rigorously as the other 17 included studies and we could not be certain that all of the data relevant to this review were included. For peak flow and blood eosinophils, some of these studies could not be pooled with the others because a different unit of analysis had been used. In these cases we reported the results alongside the meta-analysis results narratively. The main benefit of including these studies is the completeness of the evidence base, and checking study lists of existing meta-analyses is part of the standard search procedures for Cochrane reviews. Subtle differences in the methods between our own review and that of <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK> (e.g. the way data were extracted, application of trial eligibility criteria) may also have introduced a potential bias, meaning we cannot be sure that all studies relevant to our review were picked up and analysed in the same way. We considered the overall benefit of inclusion to outweigh the potential biases in light of the help provided to us by Hon Fang and the other authors of that review (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2015-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2015 [pers comm]</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current methodology has enriched this updated review. These changes, including the use of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool rather than Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and the introduction of GRADE, resulted in differences to the original protocol but should nonetheless reduce the possibility for internal biases.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-10 14:36:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two other recent meta-analyses have evaluated the treatment of asthma with long-term macrolides (<LINK REF="REF-Reitner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitner 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK>). There are noticeable differences across all three in the conclusions drawn, and this is likely a reflection of the choice of outcomes and methods of analysis. In particular, we chose not to pool results where we were uncertain of scale or measurement similarity in order to make the results as clinically meaningful as possible. Furthermore, more subtle differences in the eligibility criteria and the way scores were aggregated are likely to have contributed to differences in the results and conclusions, such as using standardised mean difference or mean difference, fixed or random effects, change from baseline or endpoint scores, merging multiple relevant study arms, etc. These differences entail difficulties with meta-analysing and interpreting the body of evidence, which is quite heterogenous.</P>
<P>The analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Reitner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitner 2013</LINK> included 12 RCTs with a minimum duration of three weeks, and reported a positive effect of macrolides on symptoms scores, quality of life, peak flow and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK> included 18 studies, including the 6 Chinese studies that were not identified by our search, and it reports a positive effect on several measures of lung function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, PEF, FVC) and airways hyperresponsiveness, but not on other measures of lung function (percentage predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC), symptoms, or quality of life. Neither review formally assessed exacerbations, either because they were not included as an outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Tong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2014</LINK>) or because the data were considered insufficient to do so (<LINK REF="REF-Reitner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitner 2013</LINK>). The lack of exacerbation data is a major shortcoming of the evidence base, considering that reducing the frequency of asthma exacerbations is the main premise of long-term macrolides treatment.</P>

<P>Existing evidence does not show that macrolides are better than placebo for most clinical outcomes. They may have a benefit on symptom scales and some measures of lung function, and we cannot rule out the possibility of other benefits or harms because the evidence is of very low quality due to heterogeneity among patients and interventions, imprecision and reporting biases.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-31 14:51:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review highlights the need for researchers to report clinically relevant outcomes accurately and completely using guideline definitions of exacerbations and validated scales. The possible benefit of macrolides in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma based on subgroup analyses in two of the included studies may require further investigation.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-09-01 17:25:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This update of the review has been brought up to date with current methodology, which meant changing some of the methods from those stated in the original protocol. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes, and a 'Summary of findings' table has been added. Methods for data synthesis have been explained in more detail, and we replaced Jadad with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not appropriate given the small number of studies in the analyses.</P>

<SUP>a</SUP>Two of the primary outcomes have not been presented. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness could not be pooled in a meta-analysis and has been described narratively in the review. Steroid dose was not well reported in the studies, and there was no data to analyse.<BR/>
<SUP>b</SUP>Clinical outcomes were poorly reported across studies, with no more than 9 out of 17 appearing in any efficacy analysis (downgraded one level for publication bias).<BR/>
<SUP>c</SUP>Differences in the recruited populations and in the criteria used to define 'severe exacerbations' (downgraded one level for indirectness).<BR/>
<SUP>d</SUP>Confidence intervals include an important benefit of macrolide and possible benefit of placebo (downgraded one level for imprecision).<BR/>
<SUP>e</SUP>Uncertainties with randomisation procedures, and high risk of attrition bias in some studies included in the analysis (downgraded one level for risk of bias).<BR/>
<SUP>f</SUP>High heterogeneity of I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 77% mainly due to one of the cross-over studies (downgraded one level for inconsistency).<BR/>
<SUP>g</SUP>Symptom scales were often unvalidated and highly variable across studies, and we chose not to pool most in a meta-analysis using standard mean differences, as this would lead to a result that would have been much more difficult to interpret (downgraded one level for indirectness).<BR/>
<SUP>h</SUP>Small number of patients in the analysis; difficult to judge precision due to different scales (downgraded one level for imprecision).<BR/>
<SUP>i</SUP>Studies in the analysis recruited different populations with regards to severity of asthma, and one study only recruited smokers (downgraded one level for indirectness)<BR/>
<SUP>j</SUP>Four studies that we were unable to properly assess for risk of bias were included in this analysis (downgraded one level for risk of bias), and we were not certain of how and when the measurement was taken in some cases.<BR/>
<SUP>k</SUP>Uncertainty in several domains across studies, but the study carrying the majority of the weight was well conducted (no downgrade).<BR/>
<SUP>l</SUP>Seven studies reported the outcomes but only three observed events (9 total events), leading to very wide confidence intervals that include important benefit and harm of macrolide treatment (downgraded two levels for imprecision).</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-05-17 10:55:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As primary author of two RCTs included in your recent review of macrolides for asthma, I would like to question the presentation of data from one of my studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2006</LINK>) that I feel may affect the interpretation of review findings for two outcomes.</P>
<P>The symptom scale forest plot (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) placed the central point for overall symptoms for our RCT on the &#8220;favors placebo&#8221; side whereas our results favored macrolide, as stated in our abstract and as illustrated in our Figure 2. It is possible the problem arose during the examination of Table 2 in which we described a symptom change score difference with a (+) result indicating improvement, as noted in our footnote. We also reported that the overall symptom score change favoring azithromycin was statistically significant (0.68, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.3).</P>
<P>The AQLQ forest plot (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) likewise placed the central point for AQLQ change score for our RCT (2) on the &#8220;Favors placebo&#8221; side whereas our results favored macrolide, as stated in our abstract. In this case the sign of the positive result was not changed because a positive score already reflected improvement. The review accurately presented the midpoint data from our Table 2 but report different confidence intervals.</P>
<P>I advocate for Analyses 1.3 &amp; 1.5 to be amended in the interest of correct data.</P>
<P>Highest regards for the work you do,</P>
<P>Dr. Hahn.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-05-17 10:55:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dear Dr Hahn,</P>
<P>We are very grateful for your helpful feedback regarding the accuracy of data pertaining to your study (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, we agree data from your study have been misinterpreted, causing the effect to lie in the opposite direction. This has now been amended in the review to correctly represent your symptom scale data in the meta-analysis, and in the interpretation of the results. There may be differences between the methods we have used and your own which make the data look slightly different. For example, we had to use a standardised mean difference analysis because the scales were not the same across studies, meaning your raw data were transformed and displayed as standard deviation units. Importantly, the pooled result for symptom scales now favours macrolide.</P>
<P>Regarding <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, while the effect for <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2006</LINK> lies to the right of the line of no difference, this indicates &#8216;favours macrolide&#8217; on the forest plot. As is standard practice for scales where higher scores indicate improvement, the labels of the plot were swapped to represent correctly the direction of effect. As above, the confidence intervals may differ slightly as a result of the method of analysis used. We used the mean change scores and standard deviations presented in Table 2 (0.59 (0.8) n = 19 azithromycin; 0.34 (1.0) n = 17 placebo), entered in a generic inverse variance (GIV) analysis in RevMan. We have not altered this analysis but hope this clarification satisfies you that these data have been interpreted correctly.</P>
<P>Many thanks again for the time and consideration taken to submit these comments.</P>
<P>Kayleigh Kew on behalf of the authors for the review.</P>

<P>15 of the 17 patients improved their symptom score; 2 reported no improvement. The mean symptom score decreased significantly after treatment with clarithromycin (1.64 SD 0.48 vs 0.88 SD 0.72 P &lt; 0.05).<BR/>
<BR/>FVC and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> did not show a significant variation during the time of clarithromycin therapy. This study failed to confirm the bronchodilating effect of the macrolide. Blood eosinophil count as well as serum and sputum ECP levels were significantly decreased after clarithromycin treatment (blood eosinophils 46.3 SD 6.9 vs 12.0 SD 2.4 P &lt; 0.1, sputum eosinophils 90 SD 32 vs 11 SD 6 P &lt; 0.05, both serum and sputum ECP P &lt; 0.05, 15.2 SD 7.3 vs 3.7 SD 1.5 and 1.7 SD 0.9 vs 0.4 SD 0.1, respectively).<BR/>
<BR/>Methacholine provocation test caused an obstructive reaction in all patients independently of the treatment. PC<SUB>20</SUB>-methacholine was higher in the clarithromycin than in the placebo group (mean log PC<SUB>20</SUB> methacholine was 2.96 SD 0.57 in clarithromycin vs 2.60 SD 0.51 in placebo P &lt; 0.01).<BR/>
<BR/>No statistically significant association was found between increased PC<SUB>20</SUB> methacholine and ECP levels.<BR/>No adverse reaction was reported during the treatment with clarithromycin.<BR/>
<BR/>The authors concluded that clarithromycin has not only antibacterial, but also an anti-inflammatory activity, associated with a reduction of the eosinophilic infiltration in patients with asthma. It is able to improve symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, but further trials are needed to investigate its clinical utility.<BR/>

<P>At the end of the 6 weeks of treatment, the increase of the mean values of morning PEF was significantly higher in the treated group (14 L/min) compared to the placebo group (8 L/min). There was a subsequent increase of the morning PEF values in both groups over the following 6 months after the end of treatment, where the improvement over baseline was 18 L/min in the roxithromycin group, compared to 12 L/min in the placebo group (P = NS). For evening PEF values, roxithromycin significantly improved PEF values (15 L/min vs 3 L/min in the placebo group) at the end of the treatment (P = 0.02), but not at later time points.<BR/>
<BR/>Both the daytime and the nighttime symptom scores showed a non-significant improvement in the treated group compared to the placebo group over the 6-month study period.<BR/>
<BR/>There was a non-significant trend for improved AQLQ score with treatment. No statistically significant difference was recorded for the daytime and nighttime symptoms scores.<BR/>
<BR/>No difference was found for rescue medications or for <I>Chlamydophila</I> antibody titres measured during the study.<BR/>No difference was reported for side effects between the 2 groups. Only mild and reversible liver function test alterations were recorded in 2 patients treated with roxithromycin.<BR/>
<BR/>The authors concluded that the (not statistically significant) trend of improvement of pulmonary function test as seen in the 3 months following end of treatment in the roxithromycin group compared to the placebo group, suggest that the effect of the macrolide therapy on PEF values could be due more to the antimicrobial effect than to the antiinflammatory effect of the drug, and that the onset time and persistence of the effect could be due to a suppression more than a eradication of the <I>C. pneumoniae</I> infection. The authors also suggested a study with the use of 2 antibiotics active against <I>C. pneumoniae</I>.</P>

<P>A significant glucocorticoid dosage reduction was recorded in all 3 groups. The maximum tolerated percentage dosage reductions were 80% ± 6% in the troleandomycin-methyl prednisone group (P &lt; 0.001), 55% ± 8% (P &lt; 0.001) for the troleandomycin-prednisone group, 44% ± 14% (P = 0.04) for methyl prednisone group. A significant difference was present only between troleandomycin-methyl prednisone group and methyl prednisone group.<BR/>
<BR/>No statistically significant difference was reported for days of supplemental prednisone for exacerbations. Symptom score was reduced by nearly 50% in patients receiving troleandomycin-methyl prednisone (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in the other two groups. Pulmonary function tests were slightly reduced in all groups, with a significant reduction of pre-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FEF25&#8210;75 in the troleandomycin-prednisone group (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). Methacholine PC<SUB>20</SUB> was significantly reduced only in the troleandomycin-methyl prednisone group and slightly increased in the troleandomycin-prednisone group, but the difference may be a reflection of glucocorticoid dosage taper and supplemental prednisone before the final evaluation.<BR/>
<BR/>Safety aspects: 13 patients received troleandomycin. 1 patient in the troleandomycin-prednisone group experienced an elevation of liver enzymes that was resolved by the discontinuation of troleandomycin. Another patient, in the troleandomycin-methyl prednisone group, reported a mild elevation of liver enzymes, which resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of the treatment. No significant alteration of serum and urine cortisol concentrations were observed, whereas an increase was observed in the methyl prednisone group. Bone density was unchanged in all groups. A slightly decrease (NS) in bone density was observed in the two groups receiving troleandomycin. One patient, in the troleandomycin-prednisone group, was severely osteopenic before the start of the study and experienced a vertebral compression fracture that was attributed to her previous glucocorticoid exposure. Another patient in the troleandomycin-prednisone group developed marked striae on the arms and trunk. She was also affected by Marfan syndrome.<BR/>
<BR/>The authors concluded that, despite the absence of a control group with only prednisone and the poor number of subjects for each group, some conclusions could be drawn from this study: it is not possible to improve lung function by tapering the steroid dose; the only goal reached is to keep the same level of lung function when reducing the dose of steroids, without severe adverse effect.<BR/>

<P>Significant reduction in the requirement for hospitalisation and steroid boost relative to the year before the study were reported in both active and placebo groups. Similar results were reported during the 2 years of follow-up, with non-significant differences between the 2 groups. Data were expressed as rate/year, not as number of events. The authors remarked that the tapering of steroid dose was performed only in situations of complete symptom control and that symptom control was not an evaluable outcome.<BR/>
<BR/>Corticosteroid dose: the mean steroid dose at enrolment was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The mean dose reported in the placebo group during the year preceding the study entry was significantly higher than in the troleandomycin group (22.8 mg/day, SD 1.9 mg/day vs 17.6 mg/day SD 1.5 mg/day P = 0.02). A significant reduction from the previous corticosteroid usage was reported for the lowest stable dose in both groups, with troleandomycin treated patients reaching a lower dose (10.4 mg/day SD 1.3 mg/day vs 6.3 mg/day SD 1.3 mg/day P = 0.03). Neither the 1-year nor the 2-year reduction of the dose was significantly different in the 2 groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Corticosteroid effects: eosinophil counts were significantly increased at the time of the 1-year evaluation in both groups. Similarly, the 60-minute stimulated cortisol levels rose during the study, and after 1 year the difference was significant in both groups, but not between groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Dual-photon densitometry of the L2-4 vertebrae showed a continued decline in both groups of bone density when adjusted for age-matched controls. The mean decline over 1 and 2 years was twice as great, but significant only in the troleandomycin group (1 year P = 0.01, 2 years P = 0.001).<BR/>
<BR/>Significant differences between the 2 groups were reported for the following 3 parameters:<BR/>Mean IgG level decreased in the troleandomycin group, and this change was not observed in the placebo group (2 years P = 0.03).<BR/>Fasting blood sugar increased in the troleandomycin group and decreased in the placebo group (2 years P = 0.02).<BR/>Mean cholesterol level increased in the troleandomycin group, although not significantly; it was lower in the placebo group after 1 and 2 years (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively), with a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03 in the 1- and 2-year groups, respectively).<BR/>
<BR/>Methacholine challenge was performed in only 11 patients in the placebo and in 13 in the treatment group. The dose producing a 20% fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> rose in the troleandomycin group, indicating less airway responsiveness (0.55 mg/mL in the placebo vs 1.86 mg/mL in the macrolides group, P = 0.08).<BR/>3 subjects died during the study, 2 in the treated group and 1 in the placebo group, none for asthma.</P>
<P/>
<P>Number of dropouts at 1 year of the study were higher in the placebo group (n = 11, 28.9%) than in the treatment group (n = 7, 18.9%).<BR/>
<BR/>The authors highlighted the importance of adequately educating the patients regarding the use of anti-asthma drugs, especially steroids. Although the study showed a significant difference in the lower stable dose reached in the troleandomycin group, the increase in indicators of side effects such as cholesterol and fasting blood sugar, and a less significant reduction in the bone densitometry, did not confirm the utility of the steroid sparing effect of troleandomycin but showed a detrimental action with increasing the potential for adverse effects of steroid treatment.</P>

<P>The study investigated the role of clarithromycin in adults with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma not optimally controlled by inhaled steroids and analysed the results according to the PCR status for <I>M. pneumoniae</I> and <I>C. Pneumonia</I> on bronchoscopy samples. A sample size of at least 72 patients for PCR status was required to achieve a 90% power to detect a difference of 0.5 in the primary outcome, the ACQ score.</P>
<P/>
<P>Of 253 patients meeting the criteria for inclusion in the study, only 92 were randomised in the 2 treatment arms (clarithromycin and placebo) due to suboptimal asthma control during the 4-week run-in period. Among them, 12 (13%) demonstrated a positive PCR for <I>M. pneumoniae</I> or <I>C. pneumoniae</I>, while 80 (87%) showed a negative PCR. The original purpose to reach 72 patients with evidence of infection was judged as not feasible, and further enrolment stopped.</P>
<P/>
<P>The ACQ score was not significantly improved in any comparison within and between the treatment arms and PCR status at the end of the study period:</P>
<P>- difference in ACQ score between the clarithromycin and placebo groups irrespective of PCR status (n = 92): 0.2 ± 0.2, P = 0.2;</P>
<P>- difference in ACQ score between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a positive PCR status (n = 12): 0.3 ± 0.5, P = 0.6;</P>
<P>- difference in ACQ score between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a negative PCR status (n = 80): 0.2 ± 0.2, P = 0.3.</P>
<P/>
<P>FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (pre-albuterol) was not significantly improved in any comparison at the end of the study period:</P>
<UL>
<LI>difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (L) between the clarithromycin and placebo groups irrespective of PCR status (n = 92): 0.0 ± 0.1, P = 0.8;</LI>
<LI>difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (L) between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a positive PCR status (n = 12): 0.4 ± 0.2, P = 0.9;</LI>
<LI>difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (L) between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a negative PCR status (n = 80): &#8722; 0.2 ± 0.1, P = 0.8.</LI>
</UL>
<P/>
<P>Similar results were obtained for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> %, morning and evening PEF and rescue medications, with no statistically significant differences shown for any within and between groups analyses, even in the PCR status comparisons.</P>
<P/>
<P>Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was significantly improved by clarithromycin compared to placebo in the whole population and in the PCR negative groups, but not among the PCR positive patients:</P>
<UL>
<LI>difference in PC<SUB>20</SUB> doubling dose between the clarithromycin and placebo groups irrespective of PCR status (n = 92): + 1.2 ± 0.5, P = 0.01;</LI>
<LI>difference in PC<SUB>20</SUB> doubling dose between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a positive PCR status (n = 12): + 0.9 ± 1.8, P = 0.6;</LI>
<LI>difference PC<SUB>20</SUB> doubling dose between the clarithromycin and placebo groups in patients with a negative PCR status (n = 80): + 1.2 ± 0.5, P = 0.02.</LI>
</UL>
<P/>
<P>The incidence of adverse events was not different between the clarithromycin and placebo group; no severe adverse event was recorded.</P>
