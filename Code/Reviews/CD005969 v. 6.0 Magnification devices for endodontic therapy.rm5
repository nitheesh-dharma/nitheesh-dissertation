<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Do magnification devices improve the success of root canal treatments (endodontic therapy)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Endodontic therapy is a treatment on the infected pulp of a tooth to remove the infection and the pain it causes. As the instruments for this treatment have become more complicated and precise, it is widely accepted practice that magnification devices should be used, with the hope that this will improve outcomes of the therapy for patients. There are different types of magnification devices that may differ in their ability to increase the success of treatments. However, there is little data to support the use of magnification devices, or help dentists decide which is the best one.</P>

<P>After the introduction of microsurgical principles in endodontics involving new techniques for root canal treatment, there has been a drive to enhance the visualisation of the surgical field. It is important to know if the technical advantages for the operator brought in by magnification devices such as surgical microscopes, endoscopes and magnifying loupes, are also associated with advantages for the patient in terms of improvement of clinical and radiographic outcomes.

<P>No article was identified in the current literature that satisfied the criteria for inclusion. It is unknown if and how the type of magnification device affects the treatment outcome, considering the high number of factors that may have a significant impact on the success of endodontic surgical procedure.

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-09 15:31:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-09 15:14:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of successful endodontic therapy is thorough mechanical and chemical cleansing of the entire root canal system, followed by its complete obturation with an inert filling material (<LINK REF="REF-Vertucci-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vertucci 1984</LINK>). Creating an ideal access opening is one of the most important steps to ensure a successful endodontic procedure. At the same time, the inability to identify and adequately treat all the canals of the endodontic system is a major cause for treatment failure and persistence of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Weine-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weine 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sjogren-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjogren 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolcott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolcott 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dugas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dugas 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent developments in dental technology have improved the clinician's ability to treat elusive regions within the oral cavity, increasing the efficiency and the quality of root canal treatment. For example, in endodontic surgery the advent of microsurgical instruments has involved technical changes in the approach to root canal preparation. Along with the diffusion of such instruments, the use of well-focused illumination and magnification devices has been recommended as a standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common magnification devices that have been introduced in endodontics are loupes, surgical microscopes (<LINK REF="REF-Pecora-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecora 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khayat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khayat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubinstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castellucci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castellucci 2003</LINK>) and, more recently, endoscopes (<LINK REF="REF-Bahcall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahcall 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bahcall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahcall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Arx-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Arx 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bahcall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahcall 2003</LINK>). Working with such devices has become a widely accepted practice in conventional and surgical endodontics. Besides increasing the accuracy of the endodontic procedure, these devices are claimed to improve diagnostic capability due to a better visualisation of the treatment field. For example, they allow identification of the presence of isthmuses, accessory canals or microfractures of the root, which are otherwise difficult to recognise and treat (<LINK REF="REF-Coelho-de-Carvalho-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coelho de Carvalho 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartze-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slaton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slaton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Arx-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Arx 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rampado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampado 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Arx-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Arx 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of loupes and microscopes has been shown to improve clinicians' working posture and therefore reduce the occurrence of repetitive stress injuries related to bad posture (<LINK REF="REF-Behle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrin 2002</LINK>). It is interesting to investigate whether the technical advantages for the operator using magnification devices are also associated with advantages for the patients, in terms of higher treatment success rate, reduced treatment time, and lower total costs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We were primarily interested in the success of the treatment at one year follow up, as determined by clinical assessment of signs and symptoms, combined with examination of periapical radiographs to evaluate radiographical healing.</P>
<P>The outcome of endodontic therapy is generally assessed one year after treatment and is categorised as follows:</P>
<P>(a) 'success' that includes two sub-categories: 'complete healing' (radiographic and clinical normalcy) and 'incomplete healing' (clinical normalcy combined with reduced radiolucency and scar formation);<BR/>(b) 'uncertain healing' (persistence of radiolucency in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms, or presence of clinical signs/symptoms associated with incomplete radiographic healing);<BR/>(c) 'failure' (presence of clinical signs and symptoms combined with reduced or persistent radiolucency) (<LINK REF="REF-Rud-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rud 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molven-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molven 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutmann 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesslen 1995</LINK> determined that the validity of a one year follow up is predictable in over 95% of the cases. When the one year outcome is recorded as 'uncertain healing', the tooth should be re-evaluated yearly up to four years after treatment and then recorded as success or failure (<LINK REF="REF-Molven-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molven 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcome was recorded when available at the following time points:</P>
<UL>
<LI>one year after treatment</LI>
<LI>between one and four years after treatment</LI>
<LI>more than four years after treatment.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes were related to advantages of using a given magnification device in the clinical procedure, that may lead to a preference of the operator for one versus another device, or to the feasibility of treating a particular clinical situation with greater accuracy:</P>
<P>(a) the possibility and ease of removing broken instruments from the canal;<BR/>(b) the quality of visualisation of root canal anatomy and morphology (detection of dentinal cracks or identification of unusual anatomical features, such as the presence of isthmuses, that may affect the clinical procedure);<BR/>(c) the quality of root-end filling (only for the retrograde treatment);<BR/>(d) the possibility of perforation repair;<BR/>(e) the total time required for completing the clinical procedure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts of all reports identified through the searches were scanned independently by two review authors. Full reports were obtained for trials appearing to meet the inclusion criteria or for which there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to make a clear decision. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently, in duplicate, by two review authors to establish whether the trials met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria would have undergone validity assessment and data extraction. All studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table and reasons for exclusion were recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data would have been extracted by two review authors independently using standardised data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as needed before use. Any disagreement would have been resolved by discussion and a third review author was consulted where necessary. If agreement had not be reached data would have been excluded until further clarification was provided.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors would have independently undertaken an assessment of the risk of bias in included studies by following the recommendations as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any inconsistencies between the review authors would have been discussed and resolved, and if necessary, a third review author consulted. Where uncertainty could not be resolved, we had planned to make an effort to contact authors directly for clarification.</P>
<P>A specific tool for assessing risk of bias in each included study would have been adopted. This comprises a description and a judgement for each entry in a risk of bias table, where each entry addresses a specific feature of the study:<BR/>(1) Random sequence generation (selection bias)<BR/>(2) Allocation concealment (selection bias)<BR/>(3) Blinding (performance bias and detection bias). In some instances it will not be possible to blind participants and researchers but we would expect that the outcome assessors and data analysts would be blinded.<BR/>(4) Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)<BR/>(5) Selective reporting (reporting bias)<BR/>(6) Other bias<BR/>
</P>
<P>Each entry would have been assessed as at low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias (lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias). We had planned to summarise an assessment of the overall risk of bias involving the consideration of the relative importance of different domains.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The following procedures would have been conducted: In order to standardise statistical calculations using Review Manager (RevMan) software, we had planned to dichotomise the outcomes, similar to a previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Fabbro-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Fabbro 2007</LINK>). All cases classified as complete or incomplete healing plus cases classified as uncertain healing in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms would have been considered as 'successful'. Those cases classified as failures plus those classified as uncertain healing in the presence of signs and symptoms would have been considered as 'unsuccessful'. The participant would have been considered as the unit of analysis. Those participants that had multiple teeth treated would have been classified as unsuccessful if they experienced at least one unsuccessful case.</P>
<P>We had planned to follow statistical analyses outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and, for each trial, risk ratios along with 95% confidence intervals would have been calculated to estimate the effect of interventions. Clinical heterogeneity would have been assessed by examining the types of participants, teeth, interventions and outcomes in each study. We would have conducted meta-analysis only if studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures were found. We had planned to combine risk ratios for dichotomous data using the random-effects model. An intention-to-treat analysis was also planned, considering as unsuccessful all participants who received treatment but in the trial were excluded from the analysis at any time for any reason.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If sufficient data were available, we had intended to conduct the following subgroup analyses: participant age group and severity of external root resorption.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>If a sufficient number of trials had been included in this review, we had planned to conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our review results by repeating the analysis with the following adjustments: exclusion of studies with unclear or inadequate allocation concealment, unclear or inadequate blinding of outcomes assessment and completeness of follow-up.</P>

<P>The electronic search retrieved 1234 studies. No further trial was identified by handsearching (the last handsearch was performed on 31st January 2009). From the analysis of the abstracts of these studies, only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Von-Arx-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Von Arx 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsesis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsesis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taschieri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taschieri 2008</LINK>) were identified as potentially eligible for inclusion in this review. There was agreement among the review authors after reading the full text of the three eligible trials that none of them could be included. <LINK REF="STD-Tsesis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsesis 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Von-Arx-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Von Arx 2003</LINK> were excluded as they were not randomised trials. <LINK REF="STD-Taschieri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taschieri 2008</LINK> evaluated three magnification devices: an endoscope, magnification loupes and a microscope (information provided by the authors). This study was excluded because the sample size calculation prior to the beginning of the study was undertaken on a tooth basis while group allocation occurred on a participant basis. Another reason for exclusion was the presence of participants with multiple teeth treated that had a greater chance of experiencing a negative outcome with respect to those that had a single tooth involved. Finally, molar teeth were not included in the first two years of the enrolment period while they were included in the third year.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-12-09 15:29:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of magnification devices in dentistry is becoming more and more common, with the aim of improving the quality of treatment. After the introduction of microsurgical principles in endodontics, involving new techniques for the root canal therapy, there has been a search for ways to enhance the visualisation of the surgical field. The use of well-focused illumination and magnification devices was recommended as a standard of care in endodontic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>). In the endodontic literature, many <I>in vitro</I> studies have been published, showing that magnification devices, such as the microscope or the endoscope, allow the identification of microstructures not visible with the naked eye (<LINK REF="REF-Coelho-de-Carvalho-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coelho de Carvalho 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gorduysus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorduysus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baldassari_x002d_Cruz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldassari-Cruz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartze-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slaton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slaton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Arx-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Arx 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaugg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaugg 2004</LINK>). As a natural consequence it has been suggested that such devices can be useful, at least in theory, for improving clinical outcomes because all phases of the root/root-end management can be performed with greater accuracy. However, as we found in this review, there is a lack of clinical prospective comparative studies evaluating the outcome of endodontic treatment using different magnification devices. All of the trials dealing with endodontic surgery that we identified, had to be excluded for reasons presented in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>One of the purposes of the present review was to evaluate secondary outcomes that could be related to the preference of the operator for a specific type of magnification device in a given clinical situation. Such outcomes were reported in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> section: the feasibility of removing broken instruments from the canal, the quality of visualisation of root canal anatomy and morphology, the quality of root-end filling, the possibility of perforation repair and the total time required for completing the clinical procedure. However, no study specifically compared these variables, while some of them were sporadically reported but never statistically assessed. For example, in one of the excluded articles (<LINK REF="STD-Taschieri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taschieri 2008</LINK>), it is reported that, based on the operators' experience, the time required for completing the surgical procedure is on average four to five minutes longer for the endoscope as compared to other magnification devices, due to the need for repeated cleaning of the lens. No trial has been undertaken, however, looking at any of the above mentioned secondary variables. In the absence of differences in the clinical outcomes, a precise assessment of these secondary variables may be important for the choice of a specific magnification device, and should be addressed in specifically designed trials.</P>
<P>Athough the use of magnification devices is a widely discussed issue amongst endodontists, the overall quality of studies regarding this topic is poor, as has been found by other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Paik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paik 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torabinejad-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torabinejad 2005</LINK>). The proportion of randomised studies is very low, as well as the number of prospective non-randomised studies for both apical surgery and endodontic (orthograde) treatment. Another review highlighted that there is a wide variability of successful outcomes for endodontic surgery as reported in the endodontic literature (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>). Such variability could be at least in part explained by the presence of a large number of factors that may affect the result of apical surgery (for example, surgical procedures and materials, operator skill, success criteria adopted, radiographic and clinical evaluators experience, patient demographics and systemic condition, tooth type, location and anatomy, size of the lesion, follow-up duration). Therefore, the use of a specific magnification device per se may not be so critical in determining the success of the treatment. However, many studies report that the adoption of magnification devices has several technical advantages for the clinician, because they allow the identification of microscopic anatomical structures otherwise undetectable by the naked eye, and that may be important for improving the quality of the treatment. Therefore, even though clinical outcomes may not be affected by the type of magnification device used, the technical advantages particular to any of them may represent a technical 'plus' for the clinician in specific clinical situations, increasing his or her self-confidence in patient care.</P>
<P>Aside from the technical reasons or the individual preferences that may justify the adoption of a given magnification device, it should be acknowledged that the disclosure of dentinal cracks or the identification of peculiar anatomical features, such as the presence of isthmuses, may affect the clinical procedure allowing a more complete and accurate root canal system management. It can be hypothesised that the latter might be associated with a decreased recurrence of post-treatment disease, thereby reducing the need for endodontic re-treatment. This point also should be specifically investigated by future studies.</P>

<P>There is no evidence to support or refute a difference in clinical outcomes when either a microscope, endoscope or surgical loupes are adopted during endodontic surgery.</P>
<P>The literature is comprised mainly of<I> in vitro</I> studies, with no high quality trials that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. In the absence of any evidence from randomised controlled trials, clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience in conjunction with patients' preferences, where appropriate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-12-09 15:31:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No randomised controlled trial was identified in the current literature that satisfied the criteria for inclusion in this review. In order to understand if there is a significant advantage in using magnification devices or not in endodontics, or to quantify the superiority of a given magnification device over the others in specific clinical situations, more long-term well-designed RCTs must be performed.</P>
<P>Given the total absence of RCTs comparing the clinical outcome of endodontic treatment (both surgical and non-surgical) using or not using a magnification device, this type of study should be prioritised. Randomised trials comparing different magnification devices in orthograde endodontic treatment are also urgently needed.</P>
<P>It is necessary that such trials investigate the effect that a given magnification device may have on the treatment of molar teeth. It seems important to explore this because endodontic treatment for molar teeth is typically more challenging than for other tooth types, and therefore it might represent a specific indication for the adoption of visual enhancers.</P>
<P>Ideally, such studies should attempt to standardise all parameters potentially affecting the outcome. In particular, factors such as the patient's clinical and demographic characteristics, tooth type and location, the operator's skill, clinical procedures, instrumentation and materials, radiographic techniques and success criteria should be standardised. In these studies it is not only treatment success that should be evaluated, but also any type of outcome that could make a difference in the choice between different magnification devices, such as the possibility of detecting important anatomical structures, the quality of visualisation, the learning curve or the total time required for completing the procedure. Such trials should also be reported in a standardised way, according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).</P>

<P>Several methodological flaws. Sample size calculation prior to the beginning of the study was undertaken on a tooth basis while group allocation occurred on a participant basis. A further concern is due to the presence of participants with multiple teeth treated that had a greater chance of experiencing a negative outcome with respect to those that had a single tooth involved. Finally, molar teeth were not included in the first two years of the enrolment period while they were included only during the third year.</P>
