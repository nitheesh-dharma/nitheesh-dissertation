The main part of the body affected is the lungs which are susceptible to infection by certain bacteria. Infection causes inflammation which results in progressive damage to the lungs. As people with cystic fibrosis get older, they are more likely to become infected on a long-term basis with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </I>This is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in people with CF<I>.</I></P><P>We wanted to find out whether antibiotics targeting <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> would reduce the effects of infection when they are inhaled into the lungs. We wanted to learn whether this treatment would improve lung function, quality of life and survival. We also looked for any harmful effects.</P><P><B>Search date</B></P><P>The evidence is current to: 13 February 2018.</P><P><B>Trial characteristics</B></P><P>The review included 18 trials with 3042 people with cystic fibrosis aged between five and 56 years of age<I>. </I>The trials lasted from three months to 33 months. Eleven of these trials compared inhaled antibiotics with placebo (an inhaled substance without the medication in it) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly.

Limited data were available for meta-analyses due to the variability of trial design and reporting of results. A total of 11 trials (1130 participants) compared an inhaled antibiotic to placebo or usual treatment for a duration between three and 33 months. Five trials (1255 participants) compared different antibiotics, two trials (585 participants) compared different regimens of tobramycin and one trial (90 participants) compared intermittent tobramycin with continuous tobramycin alternating with aztreonam. One of the trials (18 participants) compared to placebo and a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. The most commonly studied antibiotic was tobramycin which was studied in 12 trials.</P><P>We found limited evidence that inhaled antibiotics improved lung function (four of the 11 placebo-controlled trials, n = 814). Compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics also reduced the frequency of exacerbations (three trials, n = 946), risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.93). There were insufficient data for us to be able to report an effect on nutritional outcomes or survival and there were insufficient data for us to ascertain the effect on quality of life. There was no significant effect on antibiotic resistance seen in the two trials that were included in meta-analyses. Tinnitus and voice alteration were the only adverse events significantly more common in the inhaled antibiotics group. The overall quality of evidence was deemed to be low for most outcomes due to risk of bias within the trials and imprecision due to low event rates.</P><P>Of the eight trials that compared different inhaled antibiotics or different antibiotic regimens, there was only one trial in each comparison. Forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) % predicted was only found to be significantly improved with aztreonam lysine for inhalation compared to tobramycin (n = 273), mean difference -3.40% (95% CI -6.63 to -0.17). However, the method of defining the endpoint was different to the remaining trials and the participants were exposed to tobramycin for a long period making interpretation of the results problematic. No significant differences were found in the remaining comparisons with regard to lung function. Pulmonary exacerbations were measured in different ways, but one trial (n = 273) found that the number of people treated with antibiotics was lower in those receiving aztreonam than tobramycin, risk ratio 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.86). We found the quality of evidence for these comparisons to be directly related to the risk of bias within the individual trials and varied from low to high.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-22 09:24:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sherie Smith"><P>Inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but pooled estimates of the level of benefit were very limited. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence from trials measuring similar outcomes in the same way is needed to determine a better measure of benefit. Longer-term trials are needed to look at the effect of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival and nutritional outcomes.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-29 12:08:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:36:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-20 08:34:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke"><P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting inherited disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which results in abnormal ion transfer at the apical surface of epithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 1998</LINK>). This leads to production of thick sticky mucus affecting many systems around the body. One major impact of this genetic abnormality is lung disease, which is characterised by abnormal airway secretions, persistent bacterial infection and inflammation.</P><P>CF affects around 10,400 people in the UK and around 100,000 people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2017</LINK>). Whilst it was once viewed as a disease of childhood, the median life expectancy has been improving with children born in the year 2000 having a median life expectancy greater than 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dodge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodge 2007</LINK>). More than half of the CF population is now aged 18 or over (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Foundation-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Foundation 2017</LINK>).</P><P>The pattern of bacterial infection changes with age. As people with CF approach adulthood, acquisition of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) becomes more common with almost 50% of UK adults with CF being chronically infected (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2016</LINK>). This is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, increased frequency of exacerbations, increased burden of treatment, and ultimately hastened mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zemanick-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zemanick 2015</LINK>). This review will focus on inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotic therapy.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-15 14:19:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>Delivering anti-pseudomonal antibiotics by the inhalation of an aerosol is used to achieve high concentrations of the antibiotic in airways so as to control infection without the disadvantages of oral or parenteral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Touw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touw 1995</LINK>). The clinical settings in which inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotics have been used are:</P><OL><LI>eradication of infection in the early stages of infection;</LI><LI>prophylaxis;</LI><LI>treatment of acute exacerbations of lung infection; and</LI><LI>for longer-term suppression of chronic infection.</LI></OL><P>The fourth of these indications is the subject of this review. There is a recommendation to use inhaled tobramycin for treating individuals with CF who are six years of age and older, who have moderate to severe lung disease and with persistent <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-Flume-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flume 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mogayzel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogayzel 2013</LINK>).

Inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotics were typically given in 28 day cycles of one month on and one month off (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>). Current practice in the UK is to give continuous nebulised colistin as first-line treatment although the antibiotic regimen may be changed to treat exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2017</LINK>). In the USA, chronic suppression of <I>P aeruginosa </I>is with continuous inhaled tobramycin.

These outcomes should be associated with improvement in quality of life (QoL) and in survival. Additional issues of relevance around the use of inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in CF include financial cost, increased time of treatment, risks of adverse effects of the drugs and an increase in the likelihood of acquisition of infection with drug-resistant organisms by long-term exposure to antibiotics.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:36:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>This review aims to identify the most effective inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment regimens for long-term maintenance therapy in people with CF.</P><P>We know that antibiotic treatment can clear <I>P aeruginosa</I> from respiratory secretions in children with CF, and that treating early <I>P aeruginosa</I> with nebulised antibiotics (or a combination of inhaled and oral antibiotics) is better than not treating (<LINK REF="REF-Langton-Hewer-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langton Hewer 2017</LINK>).

In retrospect, this criterion was judged to be erroneous and the 2018 update of the review only includes trials where treatment lasted at least three months. The main reason for this was that treatment to suppress chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I> in the lungs of people with CF will be used for more than a month, so there is a need to know the benefit and harms of inhaled antibiotic treatment used over a longer time period.</P><P>The review found 18 trials with 3042 participants that examined the effect of any inhaled antibiotic treatment as long-term therapy (i.e. three to 32 months) in people with CF. Of these, 11 trials compared one or more antibiotics to placebo or usual treatment (n = 1130). There were four trials that compared two different antibiotics (n = 1237). Two trials compared two regimens of inhaled tobramycin (n = 585) and one trial (n = 90) compared intermittent treatment with tobramycin compared to continuous treatment with tobramycin and aztreonam. The Stead trial (n = 18) was a three arm trial which fell into to both groups as they compared different antibiotics and compared antibiotics to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Stead-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Stead 1987</LINK>).

The evidence from this trial was deemed to be of moderate quality; the quality judgement was downgraded because of the risk of bias within the trial caused by the design being open label.

The search strategy was thorough and the selection of trials for inclusion in the review from those found in the search strategy has favoured inclusion rather than exclusion, e.g. quasi-randomised trials and trials in which the criteria for diagnosis of CF were not explicitly stated were included. For three of the included trials, we were only able to find an abstract to the trial. Two of these trials were published over 30 years ago and it is unlikely that we will find any further details (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 1985</LINK>). The Bilton trial was first published in abstract form in 2013 and we have made contact with the authors to find out if there is a full paper that we can include (<LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2014</LINK>). Any extra information obtained will be included in the next update.</P><P>There was important heterogeneity amongst these trials in terms of design and outcome measures, which led to difficulties in performing the review and interpreting the results. In particular, only a few trials were able to be included in a meta-analysis of any outcome, raising the possibility of bias.</P><P>The most frequently measured outcomes were lung function, hospitalisation and antibiotic use and a measure of pulmonary exacerbations experienced. Inhaled therapy is time-consuming and this will have a negative impact on the QoL and the independence of people with CF. We were less able to make conclusions relating to QoL and survival, as these are longer-term measures; particularly with QoL measures, some trials did not report the outcome at all.</P><P>Previous versions of this review included trials of at least one month's duration and found there to be some evidence that inhaled antibiotics benefited participants in terms of improving lung function and reducing exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2011</LINK>). In this version of the review, we have changed the criteria and include only those where participants were treated for at least three months. The changing face of CF care in recent decades has lead to improved survival and as such, a greater focus on the long-term risks and benefits of different treatments. With 56.8% of adults with CF culturing <I>P aeruginosa</I> on a chronic or intermittent basis (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2016</LINK>), and 87% of them on long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy, the inclusion of short trials in the review does not provide evidence that is comparable to current clinical practice, which recommends three months of treatment with inhaled antibiotics even at the first isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I>, and essentially lifelong treatment in cases of failed eradication.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-29 12:08:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke"><P>The design, performance and reporting of trials has changed since the first included trial (n = 20) was reported 36 years ago; this first report of the use of inhaled antibiotics in CF renewed interest in this therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hodson-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hodson 1981</LINK>). Following this, six trials (n = 140) were published between 1984 and 1989; these were all single-centre trials with small sample sizes and with important problems in trial design (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kun-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Kun 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLusky-1989" TYPE="STUDY">MacLusky 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stead-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Stead 1987</LINK>). Furthermore, the doses of antibiotic used in these trials was relatively small and probably determined by the size of the ampoule for intravenous therapy, e.g. doses of gentamicin or tobramycin from 20 mg to 80 mg. In vitro data suggested much higher doses would be needed to ensure bacterial killing. The next development was production of a preservative-free tobramycin in a dose of 300 mg in 5 mL solution and able to be delivered by jet nebuliser (n = 520) (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 1999</LINK>). This trial was multicentre with larger numbers of participants. It was performed at a time when there was more critical examination of trial design in trials involving people with CF and was of higher quality. There were two trials in children with early isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I> or persistent isolation but with mild impairment of lung function (n = 203) (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Two design features that are problematic for trials of nebulised antibiotics in CF are cross-over periods and double blinding. Cross-over design for antibiotic therapy in CF is probably inappropriate. Firstly, the clinical course of lung disease in CF is unstable with a frequent pattern of progressive deterioration and exacerbations causing further temporary deterioration. Secondly, an effective antibiotic treatment may have a carry-over effect. Thirdly, treatment of exacerbations with antibiotics and more physiotherapy and other treatment will cause an improvement in lung function that is likely to persist with time, with potential for carry-over benefit. Six of our trials used a cross-over design (n = 124) (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodson-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hodson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kun-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Kun 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaizik-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaizik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stead-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Stead 1987</LINK>).</P><P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system and evaluate our specified outcomes in the summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>). The most common reason for downgrading evidence in this review was the risk of bias in the included trials. Blinding is important for these trials, but care is needed to mask the taste of antibiotic solutions and this may not have been achieved in a number of trials using normal saline for placebo. In some cases blinding was not possible due to the difference in treatment regimens and seven trials were open label (<LINK REF="STD-Assael-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Assael 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaizik-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaizik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 2013</LINK>), one trial was partially blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Stead-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Stead 1987</LINK>) and two were single-blinded (observer) (<LINK REF="STD-Kun-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Kun 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLusky-1989" TYPE="STUDY">MacLusky 1989</LINK>).</P><P>We also downgraded the evidence due to imprecision with many trials reporting low event rates or small sample sizes, or both. Difficulty in recruiting and maintaining trial numbers was a challenge and some of the included trials were underpowered for some or all of the outcomes measured (n = 470) (<LINK REF="STD-Flume-2016b" TYPE="STUDY">Flume 2016b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 2013</LINK>). The sample of trials gives an example for the debate on the relative validity of pooling results from a number of small trials with results that are prone to error or the results from a single large well-designed trial. In this review, one well-designed trial contributed 45% of all participants (n = 520) in the 11 trials comparing an inhaled antibiotic to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 1999</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:54:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>We feel that all the relevant trials have been identified and data rigorously and independently extracted by two review authors. At least two review authors also assessed the risks of bias for each trial and a third review author was brought in to arbitrate if needed. There has been a change to the review team, and although data extraction has always been done by two review authors, it has not always been the same two review authors. This may have introduced an element of bias to the way which we have reported the results of the trials.</P><P>The original protocol for this review was written in 1997. A general objective was to include as much evidence as possible from controlled trials on the use of inhaled antibiotics to suppress infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I>. This resulted in a large review with much heterogeneity in trial design and reporting, meaning that the review was difficult to analyse and interpret. Two design features open to debate are the length of the trial that is needed to support long-term use and the inclusion of cross-over trials (see preceding discussion). In the current update we have amended the protocol to include only trials of at least three months duration and we have treated results from cross-over trials with caution.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:56:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>In the UK, the first-line treatment for <I>P aeruginosa</I> is colistin followed by alternating therapy with tobramycin, as recommended by the UK CF Trust guidelines, supported by UK NICE guidance on the use of colistin or tobramycin dry powders for inhalation rather than nebuliser therapy and is also seen in local CF guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOSH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOSH 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). In the USA, chronic suppression of <I>P aeruginosa </I>is treated with inhaled tobramycin due to the sustained improvement in pulmonary function outweighing the risk of resistance developing (<LINK REF="REF-Yankaskas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yankaskas 2004</LINK>). Colistin is not recommended in US guidelines for chronic suppression of <I>P aeruginosa</I>, which is consistent with the findings of this review, i.e. that there is not adequate evidence to support its use (<LINK REF="REF-Mogayzel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogayzel 2013</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-22 13:22:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:56:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>The practice of prescribing inhaled antibiotics for many years to suppress chronic infection in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is widespread. At present, the most commonly used drugs are tobramycin and colistin (Colobreathe®). Other emerging treatments are aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin and combined fosfomycin-tobramycin.</P><P>This review is restricted to randomised trials designed to test the benefit of these drugs for periods of three months or more. The review found some evidence that inhaled antibiotic treatment of chronic infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) is of some benefit in terms of improvement in lung function and reduction in exacerbations of respiratory infection for up to 33 months (the duration of the longest trial). In addition there do not seem to be severe or frequent adverse effects. The best evidence is for the use of tobramycin which was studied in 12 trials.</P><P>However, the findings of this review raise some issues to consider when prescribing this treatment long-term.</P><OL><LI>There is a lack of evidence of benefit in terms of survival, quality of life or nutritional outcomes.</LI><LI>The level of benefit is uncertain as some trials are small and prone to error. We have included several larger trials, but heterogeneity in measurement and reporting of outcomes is such that very little pooled analysis was possible.</LI><LI>The major evidence for benefit is for use for up to six months, hence uncertainty about any longer-term benefit remains;</LI><LI>There is no adequate evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of colistin.</LI></OL></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-22 13:22:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>It is likely that inhaled antibiotics will increasingly be used for the long-term treatment of people with CF who are troubled by complications attributable to chronic lung infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I>.</P><P>This review raises some important issues concerning the recruitment and maintenance of participants. Large, well-designed randomised controlled trials would help to fill many of the evidence gaps, but this is likely to be impractical due to the relatively small number of people with CF who are able to participate in trials which could potentially add to their already burdensome treatment regimen. Although we increased the duration of intervention included in this review to at least three months, the longest trial duration was 33 months. Longer trial durations running into years would help to identify the longer-term effectiveness and harms associated with inhaled antibiotic treatment regimens.</P><P>We have included cross-over trials in this version of the review, but the design is problematic. The progressive deterioration of lung function in people with CF makes it likely that the groups will be inherently different at the baseline of successive treatment periods. Trials of a parallel design are much more appropriate for future trials. Similarly, we have included older trials in this review (over 20 years old) but with the rapidly changing face of CF treatment, it may be more appropriate to exclude trials more than 20 years old.</P><P>A future review of the literature would be much improved by more consistent measurement and reporting of outcomes between trials. Consistency, especially with lung function test results and in defining exacerbations of respiratory tract infection (in terms of hospitalisation and of antibiotic use), may lead to more definitive conclusions. There should also be information on the effect of long-term use on the outcomes of quality of life and survival.</P><P>Some specific issues which should be the objectives of trials are:</P><OL><LI>to determine the optimum dose, daily frequency of administration and frequency of treatment with tobramycin;</LI><LI>to compare antibiotics for benefits and harm; there should be a longer-term comparison of tobramycin and other inhaled antibiotics, and perhaps combinations;</LI><LI>to determine adverse effects of longer-term use, particularly on the relevance and impact of drug resistance organisms.</LI></OL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-22 13:26:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>We would like to thank previous authors of this review for their input: Gerard Ryan (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia), Meenu Singh, Kerry Dwan and Somnath Mukhopadhyay (University of Dundee).</P><P>This project was supported by the National Institute for Health Research, via Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group.
