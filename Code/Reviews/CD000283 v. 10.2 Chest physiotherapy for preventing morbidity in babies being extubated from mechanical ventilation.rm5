<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 10:41:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Active chest physiotherapy may not be helpful for all babies being taken off mechanical breathing support. Mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing) increases a baby's lung secretions. Chest physiotherapy (tapping or vibrating on the chest) is thought to clear the baby's lungs, and is often done when taking the baby off the ventilator (extubation). Although this review found a benefit for physiotherapy in terms of less babies needing to go back on the ventilator, no other benefits were shown. Also, this benefit was mainly due to the results of studies conducted a long time ago before advances such as better humidification systems to moisten the air the baby breaths and the drug surfactant. These advances may have reduced the risk of complications around the time of extubation so these results may not apply to babies in today's neonatal nurseries. This review did not show any evidence of harm for babies receiving a short course of chest physiotherapy following extubation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-12 10:33:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of electronic databases: Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to February 2009); CINAHL (1982 to February 2009); and EMBASE (2006 to February 2009), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-08-18 16:25:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials utilising random or quasi-random patient allocation, in which active chest physiotherapy was compared with non-active techniques (e.g. positioning and suction alone) or no intervention in the peri-extubation period.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-18 16:32:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of methodological quality and extraction of data for each included trial was undertaken independently by the authors. Subgroup analysis was performed on different treatment frequencies and gestational age less than 32 weeks. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. Results are presented as relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale. All outcomes are reported with the use of 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-07 15:47:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review of four trials, two of which were carried out 15 and 23 years ago, no clear benefit of peri-extubation active chest physiotherapy can be seen. Active chest physiotherapy did not significantly reduce the rate of postextubation lobar collapse [typical RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.49,1.29)], though a reduction in the use of reintubation was shown in the overall analysis [typical RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.13,0.82); typical RD -7% (95% CI-13, -2); NNT 14 (95% CI 8, 50)]. There is insufficient information to adequately assess important short and longer term outcomes, including adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-18 16:31:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caution is required when interpreting the possible positive effects of chest physiotherapy of a reduction in the use of reintubation and the trend for decreased post-extubation atelectasis as the numbers of babies studied are small, the results are not consistent across trials, data on safety are insufficient, and applicability to current practice may be limited. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-18 16:23:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation cause trauma and inflammation to the airways and increase secretions in the lungs. These effects may contribute to respiratory complications following cessation of mechanical ventilation and extubation. Postextubation complications range from problematic secretion build up causing discomfort, agitation and distress (necessitating frequent suctioning) to obstruction of major airways with resultant lung collapse. The presence of lung collapse may require increased support such as additional oxygen and occasionally reintubation for further mechanical ventilation. These complications potentially prolong the recovery phase and may impact on long term outcomes.</P>
<P>The neonate is particularly at risk of respiratory complications due to immaturity of the respiratory system. Decreasing birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Odita-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odita 1993</LINK>), increasing duration of mechanical ventilation, high oxygen concentrations, multiple intubations (<LINK REF="REF-Wyman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyman 1977</LINK>), presence of disease states such as sepsis and patent ductus arteriosus (<LINK REF="REF-Odita-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odita 1993</LINK>) and nasal intubation (<LINK REF="REF-Roper-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roper 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1982</LINK>) have been identified as risk factors for postextubation lobar collapse (PEC). The incidence of neonatal PEC has been reported at between 11 and 50% over the past decade (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odita-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odita 1993</LINK>), with reintubation required in 10-30% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1992</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-18 16:34:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory physiotherapy techniques such as chest percussion and vibrations (often referred to as active chest physiotherapy) are thought to reduce respiratory complications by promoting clearance of secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Etches-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etches 1978</LINK>), thus improving ventilation of the lungs. Improvement in oxygenation following active physiotherapy has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 1980</LINK>). However, reports on the effects of the different methods of active physiotherapy show conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curran-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curran 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 1980</LINK>). Safety in terms of stability of intracranial blood flow during suction (<LINK REF="REF-Paratz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paratz 1994</LINK>), no increase in the rate of cerebral lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1998</LINK>), and benefit in terms of reducing hypoxaemia during suction (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbury_x002d_Hough-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury-Hough 1995</LINK>) has been reported. However, concerns have also been expressed regarding the safety of this intervention. Reports of adverse effects include hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Holloway-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holloway 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1978</LINK>), rib fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Purohit-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purohit 1975</LINK>) and associated brain lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Raval-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raval 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cross-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coney-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coney 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following the publication of a small trial in 1979 (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1979</LINK>), the use of active chest physiotherapy techniques for the prevention of postextubation lung collapse became a part of routine care in many neonatal nurseries. However, a growing body of conflicting literature on the effects of active chest physiotherapy has resulted in differences of opinion about the risk/benefit ratio of many neonatal physiotherapy techniques, and also differences in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flenady-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Each author independently extracted data then compared and resolved differences. For the 2002 update, extraction of data from the previously included trials was conducted for the additional outcomes specified.</P>
<P>Additional data on neonatal morbidity were sought from the investigators of three trials (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>) provided additional data. Data were received on outcomes for one infant excluded following randomisation in <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>, there were four post randomisation exclusions for the outcome of postextubation collapse (PEC), two for intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and one for the outcome of duration of oxygen therapy. In this review, all infants randomised into this trial were included in the denominator for the outcomes of PEC and IVH. <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK> also provided additional data on the outcome of cerebral cystic lesions at six weeks of age; however, due to large number of losses to follow-up (20 and 30% in the two groups), this outcome has not been included in the review. Data for the outcomes of the duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, CPAP and neonatal intensive care stay came from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>). In this trial, these outcomes were calculated for the period from admission to the nursery (not from the time of random allocation) to discharge from hospital.</P>

<P>
<B>Active chest physiotherapy vs. no active chest physiotherapy (Comparison 1):</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B>
<BR/>Post extubation collapse (PEC) and reintubation were the only outcomes reported in all of the included trials. The overall analysis shows a trend towards a reduction in the rate of PEC with active chest physiotherapy which is not statistically significant [(typical RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.49, 1.29)]. A significant reduction in the use of reintubation within 24 hours of extubation was shown for babies receiving active chest physiotherapy [(typical RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.13, 0.82); typical RD -7% (95% CI -13, -2)]. Thus, number needed to treat (NNT) to expect to prevent one baby receiving reintubation is 14 (95% CI 8, 50). There was insufficient information to adequately assess the outcomes of bradycardia, duration of oxygen therapy, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral cystic lesions, long term neurosensory impairment or death.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes:</B>
<BR/>No statistically significant differences were shown in any other short term outcomes (duration of CPAP and mechanical ventilation, duration of neonatal intensive care) reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Subgroup analysis by gestation age (Comparison 2):</B>
<BR/>No significant effect of chest physiotherapy on the following outcomes was shown in sub-group analyses of infants born less than 32 weeks gestation reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>): postextubation collapse, use of reintubation, duration of oxygen therapy, cerebral haemorrhage, bradycardia, duration of CPAP and mechanical ventilation, duration of neonatal intensive care stay and death. Although no trend to a reduction in PEC was shown as for the overall analysis [RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.45, 2.63)], the trend to a reduction in reintubation remained [RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.11, 3.72)].</P>
<P>
<B>Sub-group analyses of differing treatment frequencies (Comparison 3):<BR/>
</B>Four trials contributed to the comparison of more frequent treatment (one and two hourly groups combined) with no treatment. In keeping with the overall analysis, there was a non significant reduction in the rate of PEC [typical RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.47, 1.24)] and a significant reduction in the use of reintubation [typical RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.08, 0.72); typical RD -8% (95% CI -14, -3); NNT 13 (95% CI 7, 33)]. Less frequent treatment (4 hourly) was compared to no treatment. Two trials were included in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>), which showed an increase in PEC with active physiotherapy which is not statistically significant [(typical RR 1.45; (95% CI 0.51, 4.09)]. The reduction in the use of reintubation is also not statistically significant [(typical RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.21, 2.99)].</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-31 17:58:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified several important limitations of the presently available evidence from randomised trials:<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Small sample sizes</B>
<BR/>Due to small numbers of infants in the four included trials, all estimates of effect are imprecise resulting in the inability to adequately assess the effects of this intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Inconsistency of results</B>
<BR/>Some of the effects, particularly the effect on postextubation alveolar collapse, are inconsistent across trials. In the case of PEC, there is some evidence of a secular trend in that the rates in the control groups of the different trials fell from 38% (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1979</LINK>) to 25% (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK>) to 13% (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>) and 20% in <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>. The size and the direction of treatment effect varies with control event rate, so that the point estimates for risk difference are -38% (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1979</LINK>), -13% (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK>), +16% (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>) and -2% (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>). Thus, a source of the heterogeneity of treatment effect on PEC may be the level of risk for PEC in the absence of chest physiotherapy. A similar trend across time, again correlated with size of treatment effect, is shown for reintubation. The rate of reintubation and the risk difference in the control groups are as follows: <LINK REF="STD-Finer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1979</LINK> 33% (RD -33%), <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK> 25% (RD -21%), <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK> 8.7% (RD -1.4%) and <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK> 3.4% (RD -1.1%).</P>

<P>
<B>Lack of safety data</B>
<BR/>Over the past decade, concerns regarding the safety of chest physiotherapy, particularly in the small preterm infant, have been reported. Information on possible adverse effects was inadequate in these trials to allow assessment of safety.</P>
<P>Although no difference was found in the number of infants with bradycardia following extubation reported by two trials, the numbers of infants studied are too small to be confident about this outcome or other more important adverse short term outcomes such as hypoxaemia and cerebral haemorrhage or cysts. None of the included trials reported measures of the important longer term outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment.</P>

<P>
<B>Applicability to present day practice</B>
<BR/>Two of the four trials were conducted 15 and 23 years ago. Applicability of the results of the review to current practice may be compromised due to advancements in neonatal care which have occurred over the interval since the earlier trials were performed. Relevant improvements in neonatal care include better techniques for humidification of inspired gases, introduction of exogenous surfactant, strategies to reduce trauma during endotracheal suctioning (less frequent suctioning and the use of measured smaller bore catheters) and the use of prophylactic post-extubation nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). These innovations may well have changed the nature of post-extubation complications considerably. For example, the use of prophylactic post-extubation NCPAP has been shown to reduce the rate of post-extubation complications (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>) used routine post-extubation NCPAP prophylactically for preterm infants. Therefore, the results of this review may overestimate the rates of PEC and reintubation in nurseries where prophylactic post-extubation NCPAP is now being used.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-08-31 17:58:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caution is required in interpreting the results of this review and applying them to current practice. Although the number needed to treat of 14 to avoid reintubation shown in the overall analysis of this review suggests that active chest physiotherapy in this situation may be a worthwhile intervention, this finding was heavily weighted by the two trials conducted some time ago (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_-Beresford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">V- Beresford 1987</LINK>) and was not supported by the results of the two more recent trials in this review. No benefit for chest physiotherapy was shown in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>) in terms of the duration of mechanical ventilation, NCPAP, oxygen therapy or neonatal intensive care nursery stay. However, adequate assessment of the effects of chest physiotherapy on these outcomes is difficult due to insufficient data and also as the outcomes were measured from admission to the nursery not from randomisation and institution of the allocated treatment.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-31 17:58:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although data in this review are insufficient to permit adequate assessment of this intervention, the lack of clear benefit for postextubation active chest physiotherapy shown is supported by other recent reports. A similar rate of PEC and no evidence for benefit of postextubation physiotherapy in terms of PEC was reported in a recent before-and-after study assessing active postextubation physiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bloomfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomfield 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, the low risk of postextubation complications (PEC and reintubation) evident in the more recent trials in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Alaiyan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Alaiyan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK>) is also supported by a recent retrospective study. <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK> reported a very low risk of PEC with no requirement for reintubation in these infants. <LINK REF="STD-Bagley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagley 2005</LINK> reported no use of reintubation for any infant with PEC (unpublished data).</P>
<P>Care providers need to consider the role of active postextubation chest physiotherapy in the light of the lack of clear evidence for benefit, recent reports of severe adverse outcome associated with active chest physiotherapy in some situations (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>) and the need to avoid unnecessary distress in the care of sick newborn infants from interventions which may not be beneficial. There are challenges in obtaining robust evidence for physiotherapy interventions due to the difficulties with blinding the intervention, and defining and measuring clinically meaningful outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Wallis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallis 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review do not give a clear direction for the role of active chest physiotherapy for infants being extubated from mechanical ventilation in today's neonatal intensive care settings. Evidence for benefit of this intervention is conflicting and it was not possible to identify subgroups of babies who may benefit. No benefit for more vs. less frequent treatment is evident.</P>
<P>Concerns regarding the safety of active chest physiotherapy for preterm neonates have been reported. Information on adverse effects is inadequate in the trials included in this review to allow assessment of safety. In view of this and the lack of clear evidence for benefit, it would seem wise to use this intervention cautiously.</P>
