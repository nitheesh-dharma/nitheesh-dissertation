<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>A wheeze that is recurrent and caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is different to asthma. Episodic recurrent wheezing happens in children who have no symptoms in between episodes and is different to wheezing that is persistent. Corticosteroids are used to relieve a wheeze caused by a viral infection. This review of trials found high dose inhaled corticosteroids help treat mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood. There is no evidence to support the use of maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids to prevent or manage episodic mild wheeze caused by a virus. More research is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Recurrent episodic wheeze in association with viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a specific clinical illness distinct from persistent atopic asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to identify whether corticosteroid treatment, given episodically or daily, is beneficial to children with viral episodic wheeze.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroid treatment versus placebo in children under 17 years of age who suffer from 'episodic viral wheeze', which is defined by wheeze in association with coryzal symptoms with minimal or no intercurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Studies were categorised according to whether treatment was given episodically or daily (maintenance). The primary outcome was episodes requiring oral corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes addressed episode severity, frequency and duration and parental treatment preference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five randomised controlled trials in children with a history of mild episodic viral wheeze were identified. Most of the children had previously required no or infrequent oral corticosteroids and had very infrequent hospital admissions. There were three studies of preschool children given episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroid (1.6 - 2.25 mg per day), two using a crossover and one a parallel design. The two studies of maintenance corticosteroid (400 micrograms per day) were parallel in design, one of pre-school children the other of children aged 7 -9 years. Results from the two cross-over studies of episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids showed a reduced requirement for oral corticosteroids (Relative risk (RR)=0.53, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.04). In these 2 double blind studies, this treatment was preferred by the children's parents over placebo (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.48,0.87). Maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids did not show any clear reduction over placebo in the proportion of episodes requiring oral corticosteroids (N=2 trials, RR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.23,2.90) or in those requiring hospital admission (N=1 trial, RR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.01,4.11).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids provide a partially effective strategy for the treatment of mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood. There is no current evidence to favour maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention and management of episodic mild viral induced wheeze.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-30 12:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A growing body of evidence suggests that childhood recurrent wheezing in association with viral infection of the respiratory tract may represent a separate entity from atopic asthma (Silverman 1993). There is epidemiological evidence for at least two different prognostic categories of pre-school wheeze. Most of this data has been generated from a neonatal cohort study in Tuscon, Arizona (Martinez 1995). It is estimated that one third of children have at least one wheezing episode before the age of three years, and these episodes are usually associated with viral infection. By the age of six years, nearly two thirds of these wheezy children 'out grew' their symptoms. The remaining third were joined by 'late onset' wheezy children and both of these groups had characteristics more likely to be considered as classical, atopic asthmatic. The risk factors for these two entities were different, the former being associated with lower levels of lung function at birth and not atopy, the later associated with normal perinatal lung function and the development of atopy. </P>
<P>There is evidence that 'episodic viral wheezing' continues into older childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) and adulthood (Godden 1994). A large cohort study in Aberdeen started in 1964 identified 7.5% of primary-school aged children as suffering from wheeze only in the presence of a cold and 5.4% with wheeze precipitated by a range of different stimuli ("asthmatic") (Godden 1994). Twenty-five years later, 30% of the 'viral wheezers' and 61% of the asthmatics continued to suffer from wheeze compared to 11% of the controls, but again, the major risk factors differed. An overall paradigm encompassing these major epidemiology studies is that 'viral wheezing' is episodic in nature and occurs predominantly in young children but can persist in some. In contrast, those young children who develop 'persistent' wheezing have airways that respond to a variety of environmental stimuli, probably through atopic mechanisms.</P>
<P>Treatment for the common but troublesome condition of episodic viral wheeze remains unsatisfactory with large numbers of patients requiring emergency treatment and/or admission to hospital, especially in the winter months (Anderson 1992). Corticosteroids are a frequently used for the secondary prevention of children of viral-induced wheeze. The aim of this review to summarize the evidence for supporting their use in children with episodic viral wheeze.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of daily (i.e. maintenance) therapy and/or episodic corticosteroid therapy for reducing the frequency, severity and/or the duration of episodes of virus induced wheezing.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-09-30 12:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for this review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-09-30 12:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Children aged 0 - 17 years with episodic viral wheeze were included. Viral wheeze was defined by the following criteria:<BR/>i) at least 2 reported episodes of wheezing in association with a clinical viral infection (confirmation of viral infection by serology, culture, antigen assay was not necessary);<BR/>ii) minimal or no symptoms between exacerbations (minimal symptoms must have been described: i.e., frequency of symptoms or use of beta2-agonist less than 3 times/week between exacerbations).</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Children with cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumonia or any other chronic lung disease;</LI>
<LI>Children with 'classical' chronic asthma defined by episodes of wheeze caused by a range of stimuli other than viruses (e.g. exercise, dust, smoke).</LI>
</OL>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any oral or aerosolised corticosteroid preparation was included. The latter could be administered by metered dose inhaler (with or without holding chambers), nebuliser, or other inhalation device. The studies were placebo- controlled with any co-interventions (e.g. administration of beta2-agonist, anti-histamine or "cough syrup") being recorded. Both episodic and maintenance treatments were considered.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Four categories of outcome measures were considered important in establishing whether corticosteroids have a role to play in secondary prevention of episodic viral-induced wheeze. These outcomes were:</P>
<P>1. indicators of severity of episodes<BR/>- number of viral-induced episodes requiring treatment with oral <BR/> corticosteroids. (This was the primary outcome for both maintenance and episodic therapy.)<BR/>- emergency department/emergency doctor visits<BR/>- hospital admissions<BR/>- mean or peak symptom scores<BR/>- mean or peak use of bronchodilators<BR/>- lung function</P>
<P>2. indicators of frequency<BR/>- frequency of wheezing episodes <BR/>- frequency of wheeze/URTI</P>
<P>3. indicators of duration of episodes<BR/>- duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms<BR/>- duration of bronchodilator use</P>
<P>4. parental preference for the therapy (i.e. between active treatment and placebo)</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>RCTs were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group database. The database was searched using the following terms : asthma and wheez* AND budesonide, OR pulmicort, OR beclomethasone, OR becotide, OR fluticasone, OR flixotide, OR triamcinolone, OR steroid, OR corticosteroid, OR glucocorticoid AND inhaled, OR aerosolised, OR nebulised AND child, OR infan*, OR pediatric, OR paediatric, OR adolescen* .</P>
<P>The bibliography of each identified RCT was searched for relevant papers. Authors of relevant RCTs were contacted to identify other published and unpublished relevant studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers (MM and JG) independently selected trials for inclusion. In addition to the inclusion criteria, their assessment of each study took note of the degree of allocation and concealment (double blind, single blind, open) using the Cochrane approach and of overall methodological quality using the Jadad Score. Disagreement between the reviewers was resolved by consensus or by the input of a third reviewer.</P>
<P>Lung function data were entered as negative values to conform with the Cochrane convention whereby effects that favour the treatment under review move to the left. </P>
<P>Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals. Summary estimates for dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks, and for continuous outcomes, as weighted mean differences or standardised mean differences, as indicated. We used the fixed effect models and, in case of heterogeneity, the random effect models. Group differences between rates were also summarised as a ratio of rates.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search was completed in April 1999 and identified 829 titles and abstracts which were screened to identify 43 potentially relevant studies of corticosteroid treatment for 'wheeze' or 'asthma'. Full text versions of these papers were obtained, and assessed independently by two reviewers who agreed that five trials met the entry criteria for this review. Reasons for excluding the other 37 papers included: treatment of post bronchiolitis symptoms (5 papers); treatment of classical, chronic asthma with persistent symptoms (12 papers); treatment of recurrent pre-school wheezing without a clear description of presence/absence of chronic symptoms or containing a heterogeneous group of subjects (some with episodic wheeze + some with chronic symptoms or some with bronchiolitis) (13 papers); treatment of virus triggers of classical asthma (1 paper - <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1995</LINK>, see discussion); studies of drug delivery that did not measure clinical efficacy ( 2 papers); a study of side effects without estimates of clinical efficacy (1 paper); a study of children with low birth weight (1 paper); a study of episodic viral wheeze comparing corticosteroid to cromoglycate (1 paper - <LINK REF="STD-De-Baets-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Baets 1998</LINK>, see discussion); a study of episodic viral wheeze using oral steroid, but not an RCT (1 paper - <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 1988</LINK>, see discussion).</P>
<P>This review is derived from five RCTs which pertain exclusively to children with mild viral induced wheeze, with no or minimal symptoms in between exacerbations.</P>
<P>There was a poor response to a letter sent to the authors of trials whose description of their subject group was unclear. Of thirteen letters sent, there were four replies, three confirming their subjects as chronic asthmatics and one suggesting a further name to write to which also confirmed their subjects as having chronic asthma.</P>
<P>INCLUDED STUDIES</P>
<P>The five included studies consisted of two studies looking at low dose maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) and three studies looking at episodic high dose inhaled steroid (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Maintenance therapy.<BR/>Both <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> used a parallel design, studying children who had reportedly wheezed during URTIs on at least 2 and 5 previous occasions respectively. Both trials studied children with mild viral wheeze, not requiring oral corticosteroids They had minimal or no symptoms in-between exacerbations. Duoll's patients were aged 7-9 years with 50% and 42% being atopic by skin prick test in the corticosteroid and placebo groups, respectively. Some had a prior diagnosis of asthma but all had minimal or no chronic symptoms. Wilson's subjects were aged 0.7 - 6 years and atopy was not assessed, but a family history of atopy was reported in 67% and 42% of those in the corticosteroid and placebo groups respectively. Again none had symptoms to suggest chronic asthma. Duoll's trial tested beclomethasone dipropionate 400 micrograms daily by diskhaler for 6 months and Wilson used budesonide 400 micrograms daily for 4 months, administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer (either a Nebuhaler (Astra) or aerochamber with facemask (Trudell Medical)). Both had run-in periods of one month.</P>
<P>Episodic therapy.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> both carried out cross-over studies of episodic inhaled corticosteroids and hence could be directly compared. <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> used a parallel design: the outcomes obtained from both designs were analysed separately, then combined in absence of heterogeneity. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> studied children aged 1 - 5 years with a clear history of wheeze in the presence of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with no interval symptoms; none were on prophylactic treatment. The severity of episodes was not documented, except for their need for bronchodilators. Atopy was not reported. Budesonide 1600 micrograms daily was given to those who could use a Nebuhaler while 3200 micrograms daily was given to those using a Nebuhaler with facemask. The observation period lasted for six months. The intervention was started at the onset of URTI symptoms until the children were asymptomatic for 24 hours. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> studied children aged 1 - 5 years with a history of wheeze in the presence of an URTI, and at least 2 episodes in the previous 3 months. Again, severity was not documented other than the requirement for bronchodilators. However, this study did allow co-intervention with prophylactic treatments (6 had sodium cromoglycate and 7 had inhaled corticosteroids) raising the possibility that some of the subjects had more severe illness than others. Atopy was not reported. Beclomethasone dipropionate 2,250 micrograms daily was given by MDI via a Volumatic (Glaxo-Welcome) at the onset of signs of "asthma" for 5 days during a two year trial period. Although this paper describes the attacks as "acute asthma", it goes on to describe how all but one episode was precipitated by an URTI. The authors confirmed that most of the study group had no symptoms between episodes ('interval symptoms'), although four did go on to start either inhaled prophylactic cromoglycate or corticosteroid subsequently. These two cross-over studies did not report the time lapse between treatment and placebo although correspondence with authors confirmed a minimum of a four week washout period. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> studied children aged 1 - 3 years with at least three reported episodes of wheezing during an URTI and no interval symptoms; parents reported wheezing or noisy breathing during most URTIs. The severity of prior episodes was not defined other than by the requirement for occasional bronchodilators. Atopy (defined by a total IgE level &gt; 2 SD) was present in 46% and 41% in the corticosteroid and placebo groups, respectively. The corticosteroid group received 1600 micrograms of budesonide by MDI via a Nebuhaler and facemask for the first three days of an URTI and then 800 micrograms for the following 7 days. The intervention started at the first signs of an URTI and the observation period lasted for 12 months.</P>
<P>SEVERITY. The majority of children in the included studies seem to have predominantly mild episodic viral wheeze (i.e. treated only with bronchodilators). The patients studies by <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> had no or low (1-2 per year) numbers of prior hospital admissions. The authors of the other two trials confirmed, by correspondence, that subjects were in the mild category.<BR/>
<BR/>ATOPY. Duoll's subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) were older than those in the other studies and approximately 50% were atopic. Atopy is a little more difficult to define in younger children, but similar numbers of atopic children were found in <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> and 50% of children in <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> had a family history of atopy. Atopy was not reported in the earlier studies of <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK>. </P>
<P>Difficulties arose in the way outcome measures were reported. Meta-analysis is dependent on mean + SD for continuous data and whilst some studies reported mean (SD), others used the mean of differences between groups with the standard error of the differences, or median and range. Correspondence with authors could not resolve these issues, hence meta-analysis of several outcome measures was not possible. None of the studies reported the validity of their symptom diaries, making interpretation of meta-analysis difficult. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All included studies stated that treatment allocation was randomised and the concealment was 'double-blind'. The method used for generation of a random sequence was not described so the authors of four papers were contacted (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>). Each confirmed that the randomisation was carried out by either the drug company or pharmacy but only one was aware of the method used - computer program <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> These four papers state that a 'double-blind' method was used without indicating the details of how this blinding occurred. Correspondence confirmed that a drug company or pharmacy coded the inhalers with the code unknown to the subjects and the outcome assessors. </P>
<P>The two cross-over studies of <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> did not state the time lapse between treatment or did not comment on any possible carry-over effect. It is essential to consider the possibility of a carry-over effect. If the effective intervention is followed closely by placebo, the therapeutic effect could be carried over into the placebo period so minimising any possible difference between placebo and treatment. Correspondence with the authors of both trials confirmed a minimum washout period of four weeks, which should be adequate for inhaled corticosteroids. </P>
<P>All authors reported withdrawals and gave reasons for them. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> had 11 withdrawals, 6 did not have two treatment pairs in the cross-over study and 5 for social reasons. <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> had 7 withdrawals, 3 did not suffer URTIs during the study, 2 were non-compliant and 2 could not tolerate the Nebuhaler and facemask. Two of the parallel studies had similar number of withdrawals in each group, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> had 16 withdrawals (9 in the corticosteroid group, 7 in the placebo group) and <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> had 12 withdrawals (6 in each group). In <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> there were 10 withdrawals, 2 from the corticosteroid group and 8 from the placebo group. The main reason for these withdrawals was difficulty attending clinic and unrelated to the disease state. </P>
<P>Only one study measured compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) by counting used blisters from the Diskhaler. There was no difference between treatment and placebo groups (being 74% and 75% respectively).</P>
<P>In general all trials were of high methodological quality, with grade A (double blind) allocation of concealment and with number of, and reasons for, withdrawals unlikely to affect outcomes.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Analysis of each outcome was broken down into three subgroups, based upon the available trials: 1. parallel trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) of low dose maintenance inhaled corticosteroids; 2. cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK>) of high dose episodic inhaled corticosteroids; 3. the parallel study (<LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK>) of high dose episodic inhaled corticosteroids. These three subgroups consider two treatment strategies: maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroid and episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroid. <BR/>

<P>1. Primary outcome: wheezing episodes requiring oral corticosteroids</P>
<P>There were very few episodes that required oral steroids. The two trials that examined maintenance low dose corticosteroid show the relative risk (RR) of needing a course of steroids lay close to the line of no effect [N=2 trials, RR=0.82 (95%CI: 0.23,2.90)].</P>
<P>2. Emergency department/doctor visits.</P>
<P>Only one of the two trials reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK>) in which the corticosteroid group had 4 subjects visit the emergency department compared to 3 in the control group. Analysis confirms no clear effect [N=1 trial, RR=1.4(95%CI: 0.36,5.49)].</P>
<P>3. Hospital admissions. </P>
<P>There were no admissions in <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> and 2 children in the placebo group in <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK>. The analysis for maintenance inhaled corticosteroid shows no clear effect [N=1 trial, RR=0.21 (95%CI: 0.01,4.11)]. The small numbers of children admitted and seeking emergency treatment underlines the low power of these trials to show any reduction in these rare outcomes. </P>
<P>4. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptom severity.</P>
<P>Due to heterogeneity of symptom diaries, meta-analysis of this outcome was not possible. <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> reported no significant difference in average severity of LRT symptoms between treatment and placebo groups [N=1 trial, WMD=-0.50 (95%CI: -1.43,0.43)]. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> also showed no significant differences in the severity of day and night time cough and wheeze scores between those receiving maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroid and placebo. These were presented as medians and are not entered in this analysis.</P>
<P>5. Bronchodilator use.</P>
<P>Bronchodilator use was not reported in <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> found no differences in median puffs of bronchodilator for those receiving maintenance low dose corticosteroid compared to placebo.</P>
<P>6. Lung physiology.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>studied children aged 7-9 years and examined daily PEF measurements, and monthly FEV1 and methacholine sensitivities (PD20). There was no difference between the placebo and beclomethasone groups in frequency, severity and duration of episodes of reduced PEF [N = 1 trial, WMD(95% CI) = 0.1 (-0.6, 0.8), 12 (-8,32), and -0.5 (-3.4, 2.4), respectively]. FEV1 was consistently and significantly higher in the beclomethasone group [N = 1 trial, WMD (95% CI) = -0.10 (-0.21, 0.01)] despite being similar to the placebo group before and after the trial. Similarly, the beclomethasone group had a higher PD20 during the treatment (data not entered as neither CI or SD given). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> studied younger children, aged 6 months to 6 years, and lung function was not measured.</P>
<P>Indicators of episode frequency. </P>
<P>1. Frequency of wheezing episodes.</P>
<P>Reduction in frequency of wheezy episodes would be an important outcome for prophylactic inhaled corticosteroids. The duration of maintenance low dose corticosteroids was different in the two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> being 6 months and <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> 3 months. Both papers report hardly any difference in the frequency of wheezing episodes between corticosteroid and placebo groups. The analysis only depicts the <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> data [N=1 trial, WMD=-0.40 (95%CI: -2.40,1.60)]. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> reported 95% CI of the mean differences instead of standard deviations and is not entered in this analysis.</P>
<P>2. Frequency of wheeze per URTI</P>
<P>No trials reported this outcome. </P>
<P>Indicators of episode duration.</P>
<P>1. Duration of episodes with LRT symptoms.</P>
<P>There was no benefit in terms of duration of symptoms (cough, wheeze) [N=1 trial, WMD=-0.50 (95%CI: -1.82,2.82)] . <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> reported a mean duration of LRT symptoms of 8.4 days in those given beclomethasone compared to 7.9 days in those given placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> reported a mean duration of symptoms of 8 days in those given budesonide compared to 8.6 days in those given placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> reported means and 95% CI of the mean differences and again standard deviations could not be derived, hence the analysis reflects only the <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK> data.</P>
<P>2. Duration of bronchodilator use.</P>
<P>This outcome was not reported.</P>
<P>In summary, only two outcomes could be pooled across trials. Compared to placebo, children receiving maintenance low dose of inhaled corticosteroids showed an improvement in FEV1 but did not experience any reduction in the number of wheezing episodes requiring oral corticosteroids or requiring hospital admission.</P>
<P>EPISODIC HIGH DOSE INHALED CORTICOSTEROID</P>
<P>Indicators of severity.</P>
<P>1. Number of wheezing episodes requiring oral corticosteroids (the primary outcome).</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of the number of episodes requiring oral corticosteroids during the two cross-over trials of episodic treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroid shows a trend favouring treatment [N=2 trials, RR=0.53 (95%CI: 0.27,1.04)]. The effect was a 50% reduction in requirement for oral corticosteroids. This clinically important effect is approaching statistical significance and deserves further confirmation by additional trials. The parallel study of acute high dose corticosteroid, <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> also reported a slightly lower number of episodes requiring oral corticosteroid in the inhaled corticosteroid group but this was also not significant [N=1 trial, RR=0.82 (95%CI: 0.52,1.29)]. </P>
<P>2. Emergency department/doctor visits.</P>
<P>Only one study reported this outcome <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> in which 10 subjects in the corticosteroid group visited the emergency department 16 times compared to 12 subjects visiting 23 times in the control group. The analysis represents visits rather than individuals and shows an effect favouring corticosteroids [N=1 trial, RR=-0.70 (95%CI: 0.50,0.97)].</P>
<P>3. Hospital admissions. </P>
<P>For the cross-over studies, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> reported 4 children admitted from each group and <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> reported 1 child admitted from each group. The parallel study of <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> reported 5 children admitted in the corticosteroid group and 2 in the placebo group. The meta-analyses for both study designs show no clear effect [N=2 trials, RR=1.00 (95%CI: 0.31,3.24) and N=1 trial, RR=3.00 (95%CI: 0.67,13.51) respectively]. No heterogeneity between trial design was observed. </P>
<P>4. Symptom scores.</P>
<P>Due to heterogeneity of symptom diaries, a meta-analysis of this outcome was not possible. <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> reported significantly lower daytime wheezing severity in the group treated with budesonide versus placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> did not report LRT symptoms separately but the total night and daytime symptom scores were significantly lower in the beclomethasone group. Both these studies reported these data as means of differences between treatment and placebo periods with confidence intervals of the differences. Standard deviations could not be derived, hence these data are not entered in the analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> reported significantly lower LRT symptom scores in the group given budesonide [N=1 trial, WMD=-0.17 (95%CI: -0.34,-0.003)]. <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> also reported significantly lower scores of cough and noisy breathing during in those receiving budesonide. That study also reported significantly less sleep disturbance (i.e. episodes of awakening due to symptoms) in the corticosteroid group [N=1 trial, WMD=-0.17 (95%CI: -0.20,-0.14)].</P>
<P>Although a meta-analysis was not possible, all three studies using episodic high dose steroid showed significant reductions in symptom scores.</P>
<P>5. Bronchodilator use.</P>
<P>The cross-over study of <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> showed no difference in doses per week (budesonide 20.2, placebo 22.2, p&gt;0.05) and, in the parallel study of <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> there was no significant difference in puffs during episodes. Again, these studies reported these data as means of differences between treatment and placebo periods with confidence intervals of the differences, hence these data are not entered in the analysis.</P>
<P>6. Lung physiology.</P>
<P>The three studies of high dose episodic inhaled corticosteroid involved children less that 5 years old and lung physiology was not performed. </P>
<P>Indicators of episode frequency. </P>
<P>1. Frequency of wheezing episodes.</P>
<P>This outcome was not reported.</P>
<P>Indicators of episode duration.</P>
<P>1. Duration of episodes with LRT symptoms.</P>
<P>Both cross-over trials looking at the acute treatment of episodes reported means of the differences with confidence intervals of the differences between the two treatment periods. Standard deviations could not be derived and these data are not entered in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> demonstrated a shorter duration of LRT symptoms with beclomethasone compared to placebo (mean duration = 6.11 and 8.38 days respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> also found a similar reduction with budesonide compared to placebo (mean duration 4.12 and 5.47 days respectively). Neither of these differences were significant, but as both show means favouring corticosteroids it could be that the studies were not powered adequately to find significance. <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK> did not report this outcome.</P>
<P>2. Duration of bronchodilator use.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> showed no significant difference in duration of days that bronchodilator was required when episodic inhaled corticosteroids were given compared to placebo (mean days - beclomethasone = 7, placebo = 8, p&lt;0.5). None of the other studies reported this outcome.</P>
<P>Parental preference for treatment.</P>
<P>This outcome was reported only in the two cross-over trials of episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids. The question was asked after treatment pairs were completed. The order in which treatments were given was randomised in both studies so that there should have been no bias in favour of either corticosteroid or placebo. The meta-analysis shows a clear effect favouring inhaled corticosteroid [N=2 trials, RR =0.64 (95%CI: 0.48,0.87)].</P>
<P>In summary, there are some benefits from the use of episodic high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. There is evidence to suggest a reduction in the number of episodes requiring oral corticosteroids, which was the primary outcome of this review, although this is not statistically significant. In these doubled blinded studies, there was a clear parental preference for episodic inhaled corticosteroids as compared to placebo. There was no difference in admissions to hospital possibly due to insufficient power of the studies to demonstrate a group difference in children with mild exacerbations.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The assertion that all wheezing in infancy and early childhood should be labelled "asthma" is controversial. Epidemiology studies clearly identify a group of young children who only wheeze with episodes of URTI and have minimal or no symptoms in between. Most of these children outgrow wheezing by school age. The pattern of episodic viral-induced wheeze in these children may be distinct from typical asthma and may require a different treatment approach.</P>
<P>There are only five trials that clearly identify their subjects as having episodic wheeze with URTIs. These studies report that almost all episodes were precipitated by an URTI. The patients had predominantly mild episodic viral wheeze, with minimal or no interval symptoms, infrequent hospital admissions and infrequent requirement for oral corticosteroids. The review has identified some clear implications for the two identified treatment strategies examined in this review.</P>
<P>Maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids. </P>
<P>There is no evidence regular daily maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids reduced the number of episodes requiring oral corticosteroids and/or hospital admission. Severity of symptoms assessed by diary and bronchodilator use was not improved, but in older children aged 7-9 years, there was improved lung function (FEV1 and methacholine responsiveness) measured at eight points over a six month period in the corticosteroid group (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>). This improvement was not reflected in any recordable clinical benefits and during viral episodes there was no difference between placebo and steroid in terms of reduction in PEF. A question remains as to whether this improvement occurs only in the older age group and whether this group of wheezing children could in fact be 'silent' asthmatics with unrecognised chronic disease. However, since there was no improvement in clinical symptoms, we conclude that there is no evidence favouring the use of maintenance corticosteroids in the treatment of episodic viral wheeze in young children who have few or no intercurrent symptoms.</P>
<P>Episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids. </P>
<P>Episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids started either at the onset of upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms have some benefits for children aged less than 5 years old with episodic viral wheeze. Pooling of the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK>) show a 33% reduction in episodes requiring oral corticosteroids, although statistical significance cannot be attached to this calculation since it was obtained by combining results from cross-over and parallel group trials and methods for such meta-analyses have not yet been agreed. However, the cross-over studies alone showed that such episodes were lower although not quite at the level of statistical significance. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions did not seem to be affected, but the frequency of the latter outcome was low so it is unlikely these studies would have had sufficient statistical power to detect any reduction. The potential benefit to be obtained with episodic inhaled corticosteroids is reflected most clearly in the treatment preference expressed by parents, which clearly favoured inhaled corticosteroid over placebo. </P>
<P>Methodological issues</P>
<P>There are four methodological issues that should be noted. Firstly, One of the clearest pieces of evidence for the efficacy of high dose episodic steroids comes from the estimates of parental treatment preference. Such estimates are easier to obtain in cross-over studies, but can be obtained in parallel group studies as well. No comparable estimates are available for the parallel studies of low dose maintenance inhaled corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Second, the baseline of children appeared similar across the three studies of episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Indeed, all studied children had predominantly mild episodic viral wheeze with few prior episodes requiring oral corticosteroids or admissions. These results may not therefore be generalised to children with moderate exacerbations (requiring oral corticosteroids) and severe exacerbations (requiring frequent hospital admissions). </P>
<P>The second issue is atopy. In <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Svedmyr 1999</LINK>, some of the children presenting with viral-induced asthma may have, or go on to have, unrecognised persistent asthma. In <LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>, children who were all older than 6 years, may in fact be a mixed group comprised of children with viral wheeze with an over-representation of children with unrecognised persistent asthma. Indeed despite their episodic symptoms, their older age and improved lung function on maintenance corticosteroids suggest that some did have unrecognised persistent asthma. Stratification based upon atopy, a reasonably good marker of persistent asthma, may have helped clarify the issue of a mixed group of patients who perhaps present a different response to the intervention, but it was not possible from the data available to us. Exclusion of this trial did not alter the overall conclusions. Furthermore, the noted improvement in lung function was not reflected in improved symptoms with maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>). In future trials, documenting atopy among children with seemingly viral-induced asthma and stratifying the analysis on this variable, should be seriously considered.<BR/>
<BR/>The final issue is compliance. A low compliance rate on maintenance therapy could account for a lower effectiveness compared to episodic treatment. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Duoll-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Duoll 1997</LINK>) reported compliance by counting used blisters on the Diskhaler; it found reasonably good compliance (74% and 75% in the treatment and placebo group, respectively).</P>
<P>Summary</P>
<P>There has been one trial examining the effectiveness of episodic oral corticosteroids in the prevention of episodic viral wheeze: a significant reduction in duration of attacks and number of visits to emergency departments and of hospital admission were documented (<LINK REF="STD-Brunette-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 1988</LINK>). This study was open and not randomised, hence was not included in the review. </P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence pertaining to the only two tested treatment strategies for viral-induced wheeze. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that a low daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid is beneficial in the prophylaxis of mild episodic viral wheeze. Conversely, high dose episodic inhaled corticosteroids appears partially effective in preventing or attenuating viral-induced episode in children with predominantly mild episodes. This observation perhaps points to some inherent difference in the pathophysiology and management of acute viral episodes of wheeze compared to the persistent asthma, a difference highlighted recently by Reddel 1999. If all that wheezes is indeed not asthma, then treatment strategies should be tailored to the clinical problem. The accuracy of a clear and detailed history is essential in guiding treatment strategy. This may not be easy as many chronic asthmatics start expressing their disease during URTI in their preschool age. The support of more objective measurements (e.g. lung function tests and biological markers of allergic disease), where appropriate, may add guidance in the future. </P>
<P>This review highlighted the importance of presentation of outcome measures. The papers by <LINK REF="STD-Connett--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1990</LINK> gave a clear presentation of the differences between corticosteroid and placebo, however, standard deviations for the means could not be derived. All five papers failed to report some potentially useful outcome measures and the use of a variety of different, usually unvalidated, symptom scores to judge severity made it difficult to compare trials. </P>
<P>Finally, a commonly used treatment in episodes of viral wheeze is undoubtedly a short course of oral corticosteroid in association with inhaled beta2-agonists. The use of this strategy for the prevention of episodic viral wheeze has not been studied adequately.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children with a clear history of mild episodic viral induced wheeze (i.e. minimal or no symptoms between exacerbations and little requirement for oral corticosteroids or hospital admissions during the acute episode), the administration of high dose inhaled corticosteroid (1.6 - 2.25 mg per day) at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection is effective in reducing the severity of exacerbations as documented by parental preference. It may also reduce the requirement for oral corticosteroids. However, there is no evidence to suggest that episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroid reduces hospital admissions or bronchodilator use. Conversely, use of daily low dose inhaled corticosteroid does not seem to provide any clinical benefit. However, these conclusions are derived only from trials examining children with predominantly mild exacerbations. The best preventative strategy for moderate to severe viral induced wheeze remains to be determined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. This area has received relatively little research and several important outcome measures need to be reported. Improved reporting of the severity of the episode as judged by validated functional status instruments and/or symptom scores, use of bronchodilators, need for emergency department visits and rescue oral steroids is required.</P>
<P>2. There has only been one non-randomised study of oral corticosteroids given at the onset of respiratory tract symptoms as a preventative strategy. This strategy which was applied to children with severe and frequent wheeze now deserves a good randomised double blind controlled trial.</P>
<P>3. Subgroup analysis for the effect of atopy has not been addressed. A question remains as to whether those with atopy who present with episodic viral wheeze respond similarly to the tested intervention.</P>
<P>4. There is a need for trials in children with higher morbidity i.e. those who required oral corticosteroids or were admitted to hospital during previous viral induced exacerbations. Outcomes of primary importance should be the need for oral corticosteroids and the need for hospital admission.</P>
