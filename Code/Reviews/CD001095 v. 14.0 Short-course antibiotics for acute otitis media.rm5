<DESCRIPTION>
<P>As of 19 June 2012, this Cochrane Review is no longer being updated, as there is high-quality evidence that treating children with acute otitis media with a short course (less than seven days) of antibiotics, compared to treatment with a long course (seven days or greater) of antibiotics, increases the likelihood of treatment failure in the short term, meaning further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect in our primary outcome. The review authors recommend that it is no longer necessary to update this review.</P>

Two of the studies included in the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Kozyrskyj-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozyrskyj 2000</LINK>) were excluded due to the outcome not being reported as a treatment failure (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1986</LINK>) and an additional three studies have been excluded; two were excluded due to use of ceftibuten which has been deemed not to be clinically relevant (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>); and one for the duration of antibiotic therapy being equivalent in both arms (<LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2009</LINK>). The 22 studies that were included in this updated review brought the 30-day findings closer to equivalence (primary outcome). This would suggest that any new studies would not change the current outcomes and the review authors recommend that it is no longer necessary to update this review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-19 11:57:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM), or middle ear infection, is a common childhood illness, with more than half of all children having at least one infection by the time they are seven. Although otitis media often resolves without treatment, it is frequently treated with antibiotics. The length of treatment varies widely. This review of 49 trials found that treating children with a short course (less than seven days) of antibiotics, compared to treatment with a long course (seven days or greater) of antibiotics, increases the likelihood of treatment failure in the short term. No differences are seen one month later. The amount of gastrointestinal adverse events decreased with a shorter course of antibiotics.</P>

Risk of treatment failure was higher with short courses of antibiotics (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55) at one month after initiation of therapy (21% failure with short-course treatment and 18% with long-course; absolute difference of 3% between groups). There were no differences found when examining treatment with ceftriaxone for less than seven days (30% failure in those receiving ceftriaxone and 27% in short-acting antibiotics administered for seven days or more) or azithromycin for less than seven days (18% failure in both those receiving azithromycin and short-acting antibiotics administered for seven days or more) with respect to risk of treatment failure at one month or less. Significant reductions in gastrointestinal adverse events were observed for treatment with short-acting antibiotics and azithromycin.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-17 11:50:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-06-04 18:34:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood health problems, a leading cause of visits to a physician and the most frequent reason children receive antibiotics or undergo surgery. The cost estimates for AOM in the US are between $3 and $5 billion per year. Most children will have at least one episode of AOM, with the peak incidence period being between 6 and 11 months (<LINK REF="REF-Rovers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovers 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>AOM is defined as the presence of a middle ear effusion in conjunction with signs and symptoms of inflammation in the middle ear, such as otalgia, otorrhoea, fever or irritability. There is a high rate of spontaneous resolution for AOM, but if left untreated it can occasionally lead to complications, such as acute mastoiditis. Hearing loss can lead to behavioural changes and communication delay (<LINK REF="REF-Rovers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovers 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-04 18:34:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard duration of therapy in North America is 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-Froom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froom 1990</LINK>). However, the optimal duration of treatment is not known and varies worldwide. Half of the practitioners in Great Britain prescribe a five-day course compared to the majority of practitioners in the Netherlands who prescribe six to seven days of antibiotic therapy. Many opt for no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Froom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froom 1990</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-04 18:34:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The decline during the 1940s and 1950s in suppurative complications of AOM throughout North America and Europe has been attributed to antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1995</LINK>). Evidence suggests that antibiotic-treated and untreated children living in high-income countries have similar long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mygind-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mygind 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Buchem-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Buchem 1981</LINK>). However, a meta-analysis pooling the results of four studies suggests that although the spontaneous rate of resolution was high with placebo or no drug (81%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 69% to 94%), antimicrobial therapy increased resolution by 13.7% (95% CI 8.2% to 19.2%) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1994</LINK>). A meta-analysis by Del Mar documented that compared to placebo, antibiotics reduce pain at two to seven days after the start of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2009</LINK>). The absolute benefit of this finding is 5.6% fewer children experience pain at two to seven days. Long-term outcomes were similar with and without treatment.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-17 11:50:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Practitioners in North America may be hesitant to discontinue prescribing antibiotics, despite findings from the medical literature that support management of AOM without antibiotics. Moreover, the therapy duration for optimal outcome continues to be a question. Expert opinion has recommended five days of antimicrobial treatment for uncomplicated otitis media in children over the age of six years (<LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1997</LINK>). The quality of scientific evidence to support a policy for shorter courses of antibiotic treatment has been assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Pichichero-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichichero 1997</LINK>), but lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation. Concern regarding resistant bacteria from the overuse of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>) and poor compliance is increasing, as is the cost of health care. Therefore, it is desirable to determine the shortest duration of antibiotic treatment that would result in favorable outcomes. We felt that a systematic review would add some objectivity to this debate.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-06-17 11:50:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of a short course of antibiotics (less than seven days) in comparison to a long course (seven days or longer) of antibiotics for the treatment of children with AOM. Subgroup analyses of children less than two years old, children with a perforated ear drum, and children with a history of recurrent otitis media were pursued to address concerns that these groups may have less favorable outcomes.</P>

<P>In the first publication of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Kozyrskyj-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozyrskyj 2000</LINK>) clinical trials examining the antibiotic treatment of AOM were retrieved from the medical literature search and evaluated by the review authors according to the selection criteria previously described.

<P>A total of 10 studies utilised the same antibiotic in both the short and long courses of therapy.

A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to compare the two trials that used the same antibiotic (amoxicillin-clavulanate) in both arms.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-17 11:51:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>A reduction in the treatment of AOM from 10 to five days<SUP> </SUP>of short-acting antibiotics may slightly increase the risk of<SUP> </SUP>a child experiencing signs and symptoms, relapse or re-infection<SUP> </SUP>at eight to 19 days (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.64). By 30 days following<SUP> </SUP>initiation of therapy, a longer course of short-acting antibiotics<SUP> </SUP>is comparable to a five-day course in terms of these outcomes<SUP> </SUP>(OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.43). When studies comparing the same antibiotics in both arms were analyzed the results favoured the use of longer regimens of therapy (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.01). Notably 22 studies published after 1998 were added to the updated meta-analysis and brought the 30-day findings closer to equivalence. Studies that had low risk of bias for the component of blinding had significantly higher risks of treatment failure (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.77) compared to those with high risk of bias for blinding (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.41). The long-term comparability between a short and long course of antibiotics is biologically plausible, on the basis of: 1) spontaneous resolution of untreated AOM (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1994</LINK>); 2) early eradication of pathogens after three to five days of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Howie-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howie 1969</LINK>); 3) poorer penetration of the antibiotic into the ear with continued administration as inflammation decreases (<LINK REF="REF-Canafax-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canafax 1991</LINK>); and 4) treatment of children without AOM because of diagnostic uncertainty (<LINK REF="REF-Froom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froom 1990</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-04 19:01:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Appreciating that a shortened course of antibiotics may protect the child from<SUP> </SUP>developing resistant microorganisms (<LINK REF="REF-Kozyrskyj-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozyrskyj 1998</LINK>), we report these results 12 years later when many clinical practice guidelines are proposing no antibiotic treatment or 'watchful waiting' as a first-line approach to treating AOM. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends reserving antibiotic therapy for children that are less than or equal to two years with severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pediatric-Guidelines-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pediatric Guidelines 2004</LINK>). More recently the Canadian Paediatric Society recommended a 'wait and watch' approach for children over six months with uncomplicated, non-severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-Forgie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 2009</LINK>). This is consistent with a Cochrane Review examining the effectiveness of antibiotics for AOM (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2009</LINK>) and an individual patient meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spiro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vouloumanou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vouloumanou 2009</LINK>). If antibiotics are used, our results indicate that a long course of treatment can minimise the risks of treatment failure or recurrence post-treatment, but may not make a difference in the long term.</P>
<P>This updated review also found no significant differences when examining short courses of ceftriaxone. However, in the one study where adverse effects were examined, they were much higher in the ceftriaxone group. As administering ceftriaxone also requires an injection, this does not seem to be a good option for management of AOM.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-06-04 19:01:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Higher risk of treatment failure occurred with three to five days of azithromycin (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.55) at 8 to 19 days after the initiation of treatment. This significant result was not repeated when examining treatment failure at 20 to 30 days (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17). Outcome differences noted between the evaluations at eight to 19 days and 20 to 30 days likely reflects bias in the timing of evaluation. Children treated with a long course of antibiotics had fewer days to experience an outcome than those treated with five days when the time to evaluation was 8 to 19 days, as opposed to 30 days (<LINK REF="REF-Pichichero-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichichero 1997</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-06-04 19:02:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential weaknesses of meta-analysis techniques are that they incorporate existing biases and introduce new biases, some of which have predicted discordance of results between meta-analyses and single large RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Borzak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borzak 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). To minimise bias during study selection, we used pre-determined inclusion criteria, and most trials were assessed in a blinded fashion, although recent evidence suggests that blinded evaluations are not necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>). We assessed publication bias in our funnel plot of sample size versus ORs (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and with additional statistical tests (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) of significance. Publication bias was not evident. The issue of trial heterogeneity was addressed in our grouping of antibiotics according to pharmacokinetic profile (<LINK REF="REF-Schentag-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schentag 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gooch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gooch 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoberman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoberman 1997</LINK>) contained two arms comparing longer course versus a short course of antibiotic. In the original review the short-course arm was counted twice against each long-course arm of that study. In the update of this review, we have modified our methods and combined both long-course arms in a single comparison against the short-course arm. In an effort to test whether this new method would change our results we compared the previous meta-analysis against a new analysis where we used the new statistical method but did not add the additional studies which are a part of this update. This new method did not have a great effect on our results.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-06-17 11:51:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Most of the 'short-acting' antibiotics in this study are commonly prescribed in primary practice and our sensitivity analyses indicated that comparisons between different short-acting antibiotics did not alter treatment outcomes. Comparability was also demonstrated between ceftriaxone and a longer course of antibiotics, although the sample size of the consolidated trials was smaller. The equivalence observed between a three or five-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of other antibiotics was unchanged in sensitivity analyses, but these could not be performed for outcomes at 8 to 19 days. It is difficult to support the use of azithromycin or ceftriaxone based on their cost, and concern over indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1996</LINK>). Dagan et al documented increasing rates of erythromycin resistance to <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</I> over the period that azithromycin was prescribed more often to children. The increased prescription of amoxicillin-clavulanate did alter resistance to penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-Dagan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 2006</LINK>). Ceftriaxone's intramuscular mode of administration may further limit its role (<LINK REF="REF-Eppesl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eppesl 1997</LINK>). Incidence of diarrhea and vomiting may be increased with antibiotic use in children with AOM (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1997</LINK>). Findings did not demonstrate that a shortened course of antibiotics decreased the likelihood of gastrointestinal effects, except when compared to a longer course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.</P>

<P>Evidence is increasing for a wait and watch approach to AOM. We believe that this is the most prudent approach for most children who are older than six months or do not have serious or complicated disease. If treatment is warranted, the clinician must decide if treatment for 7 to 10 days is worth the slightly reduced risk of treatment failure in the short term (&lt; 21 days). Shorter courses can also be safely used, resulting in few side effects and, perhaps, a lower risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Shorter courses may also be associated with higher levels of compliance.</P>

<BR/>Hoberman 1997a and b are the same study and so the short course data have been counted twice.</P>
<P>2. For both the Hoberman and Boulesteix studies the treatments being compared differ not only in terms of duration (short versus long) but also in terms of other aspects (for example, formulation, dose and dosing schedule). Thus as regards the comparison of short versus long they are biased.</P>

<P>1. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gooch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gooch 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoberman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoberman 1997</LINK>) in the current review contained two arms comparing long course versus short course of antibiotics. In the original review the short arm was counted twice against each long arm of that study. In the update of this review, we have modified our methods and combined both long-course arms in a single comparison against the short-course arm, as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining articles (<LINK REF="STD-Boulesteix-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boulesteix 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1988</LINK>) were checked to ensure that all patients enrolled in the study were accounted for only once. These three trials clearly indicate that each patient is only accounted for in one of the groups (short or long-course).</P>
<P>Hoberman 1997b has been removed from the updated review.</P>
<P>2. These minor differences were considered but were not deemed clinically important to the current question, and we don't believe this introduces any bias to the comparison.</P>

<P>The research librarian, in collaboration with the research team, developed and implemented search strategies designed to identify the highest quality of evidence for this review. The English and non-English language medical literature was searched using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify published clinical trials of AOM during the time period, January 1966 to July 1997. The Science Citation Index was utilised to identify additional trials which had cited relevant papers. The Current Contents/Life Sciences Index was searched for recently published AOM trials, not yet abstracted in MEDLINE.</P>
<P>Search updates were conducted with a modified search strategy using the following electronic resources for the years 1997 to August 2008 (exceptions stated in brackets) and no language restriction: MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group; this group handsearches journals pertinent to their content area and adds relevant trials to the registry), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge<SUP>SM </SUP>[3.0]), CINAHL Full Text (via EBSCOhost). The NLM (National Library of Medicine) Gateway, BioMed Central and OCLC PapersFirst and ProceedingsFirst were searched for identification of meeting abstracts. Additionally, trials registers such as Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Research Register, CRISP (Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects), the TRIP Database (Turning Research Into Practice), Scirus, Proquest Dissertations and Theses - Full Text (1861 to 2008), and Google Scholar were searched for additional unpublished controlled trials and reports. The reference lists of relevant reviews and included studies were reviewed, and authors of included studies were contacted, as required (e.g. to clarify the source of population in cases of multiple publications or to seek additional data).</P>
<P>For the search strategies, a combination of subject headings and keywords were adapted for each electronic resource using the following terms: &#8216;otitis media&#8217;, &#8216;acute otitis media&#8217;, &#8216;ear infection&#8217;, &#8216;otorrhea&#8217;, &#8216;anti-infective agents&#8217;, &#8216;treatment outcome&#8217;, &#8216;antibacterial&#8217;, &#8216;antibiotic&#8217;, &#8216;bacteriocide&#8217; and &#8216;antimicrobial&#8217;.</P>
