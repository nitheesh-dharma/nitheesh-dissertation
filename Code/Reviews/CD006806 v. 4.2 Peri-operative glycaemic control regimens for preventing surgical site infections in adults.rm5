<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-07 16:36:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Wound-related infections that complicate operations ("surgical site infections") result in worse patient outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that decreasing blood glucose levels to within a low, narrow range (strict control) around the time of surgery may decrease infections and improve outcome. However, concerns about side effects from low glucose levels, such as seizures and increased risk of death, have prevented widespread use of this strategy. There are only five trials comparing strict control strategies with the conventional strategy of treating blood glucose levels only when they become high. These trials differ significantly in patient characteristics, glucose targets, medications and methods used to lower glucose levels, as well as the outcomes measured. Furthermore, the individual studies, which are small and/or flawed, do not demonstrate a significant decrease in surgical site infections. There are insufficient data to support the routine adoption of strict blood glucose control around the time of operation to prevent surgical site infections.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:05:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization and are potentially preventable. Peri-operative hyperglycaemia has been associated with increased SSIs and previous recommendations have been to treat glucose levels above 200 mg/dL. However, recent studies have questioned the optimal glycaemic control regimen to prevent SSIs. Whether the benefits of strict or intensive glycaemic control with insulin infusion as compared to conventional management outweigh the risks remains controversial.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:05:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To summarise the evidence for the impact of glycaemic control in the peri-operative period on the incidence of surgical site infections, hypoglycaemia, level of glycaemic control, all-cause and infection-related mortality, and hospital length of stay and to investigate for differences of effect between different levels of glycaemic control.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-04-08 09:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A search strategy was developed to search the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 25 March 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1; Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 2 2009); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2009 Week 12) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to March Week 3 2009). The search was not limited by language or publication status.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:05:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated two (or more) glycaemic control regimens in the peri-operative period (within one week pre-, intra-, and/or post-operative) and reported surgical site infections as an outcome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-07 16:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard method for conducting a systematic review in accordance with the Cochrane Wounds Group was used. Two review authors independently reviewed the results from the database searches and identified relevant studies. Two review authors extracted study data and outcomes from each study and reviewed each study for methodological quality. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by referral to a third review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:05:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five RCTs met the pre-specified inclusion criteria for this review. No trials evaluated strict glycaemic control in the immediate pre-operative period or outside the intensive care unit. Due to heterogeneity in patient populations, peri-operative period, glycaemic target, route of insulin administration, and definitions of outcome measures, combination of the results of the five included trials into a meta-analysis was not appropriate. The methodological quality of the trials was variable. In terms of outcomes, only one trial demonstrated a significant reduction in SSIs with strict glycaemic control, but the quality of this trial was difficult to assess as a result of poor reporting; furthermore the baseline rate of SSIs was high (30%). The other trials were either underpowered to detect a difference in SSIs, due to a low baseline rate (less than or equal to 5%), or did not report SSIs as a single outcome but as part of a composite. Of the three trials reporting hypoglycaemia (which was not consistently defined) all had a higher rate in the strict glycaemic control group but none attributed significant morbidity to the hypoglycaemia. Adequacy of glucose control between groups was measured differently among studies. Studies could not be compared due to differences in target ranges, and were susceptible to measurement bias due to differences in frequency of measurement and lack of blinding by the providers following the glycaemic protocols. Infection-related mortality was not reported in any of the trials, and no trials demonstrated a significant difference in all-cause mortality. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the strict glycaemic control groups in only one trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:05:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support strict glycaemic control versus conventional management (maintenance of glucose &lt; 200 mg/dL) for the prevention of SSIs. No trials were found that evaluated strict glycaemic control in the immediate pre-operative period or outside the setting of an intensive care unit. The trials were limited by small sample size, inconsistencies in the definitions of the outcome measures and methodological quality. Further large randomised trials are required to address this question and may be most appropriately performed in patients at high risk for SSIs.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:06:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infections (SSIs) can result in death, increased length of hospital stay, and increased resource utilization (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkland 1999</LINK>). SSIs range from simple wound infections involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues, to deep soft-tissue infections, or infections of the space or organ manipulated during the surgical procedure. Depending on the location, depth, and severity of the infection, an SSI can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars (US $) per case (<LINK REF="REF-Fry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 2002</LINK>). Both pre-existing patient diseases (such as diabetes) and modifiable risk factors (such as failure to use sterile precautions or to administer appropriate antibiotics prior to surgery) contribute to the development of these infections. One potentially modifiable risk factor associated with SSIs is peri-operative hyperglycaemia or elevated blood glucose levels around the time of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Estrada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estrada 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomposelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomposelli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trick 2000</LINK>). While normal glucose levels in non-diabetic non-stressed patients range from 70 to 110 mg/dL, glucose levels between 110 and 200 mg/dL have not traditionally been treated in the peri-operative period. Published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommend treatment of hyperglycaemia in surgical patients with diabetes to achieve levels below 200 mg/dL peri-operatively (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). This recommendation, however, has been challenged by studies suggesting that more aggressive treatment of elevated glucose levels with insulin, even in non-diabetic patients, reduces infectious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Furnary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnary 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2001</LINK>). The optimal glucose level is unknown, particularly since hypoglycaemia (variably defined as glucose levels less than 40 to 60 mg/dL) - which can result in seizures, hypotension and death - becomes of increasing concern with a lower glucose target (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatia 2006</LINK>). A large amount of the available data evaluating the effect of different degrees of glycaemic control on SSIs are limited to cardiac surgery patients, which raises questions about the generalisability of this information to other surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Furnary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnary 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hyperglycaemia occurs after surgical stress - even after uncomplicated elective surgery - and may increase the risk of infectious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Ljungqvist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljungqvist 2005</LINK>). Hyperglycaemia stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and depresses the immune system, thus increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections (<LINK REF="REF-Cavaillon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavaillon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delamaire-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delamaire 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephan 2002</LINK>). In critically-ill patients who require intensive care, there is evidence that treatment of hyperglycaemia with intravenous insulin infusions results in fewer infections and improves outcome. The largest randomised controlled trial (RCT) of more than 1500 patients of strict glycaemic control to maintain glucose levels less than 110 mg/dL compared with less than 200 mg/dL in critically-ill patients (the Leuven trial) demonstrated reduced bloodstream infections and improved mortality in patients receiving strict glycaemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2001</LINK>). Although the majority of patients were cardiac surgery patients, SSIs were not measured as an outcome. Strict glycaemic control has not been uniformly adopted in surgical patients, however, because both the reproducibility of the results of the Leuven trial and the generalisability to other patient groups have been challenged (<LINK REF="REF-Brunkhorst-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunkhorst 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devos 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to RCTs in critically-ill patients, several studies - largely published in the cardiothoracic surgery literature - have reported an association between peri-operative glucose levels and post-operative infection rates (<LINK REF="REF-Estrada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estrada 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furnary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnary 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Latham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerr 1997</LINK>). A large proportion of these data were derived from retrospective and prospective cohort studies, which were subject to methodological flaws such as confounding by temporal changes. Additionally, the timing of glucose control (pre-, intra-, or post-operative) and the target levels vary between studies. Many of these studies utilize a threshold of 200 mg/dL to define hyperglycaemia, which may still confer an increased risk for SSIs and mortality in critically-ill cardiac-surgery patients; the risks and benefits of a lower threshold remain to be clarified. Additionally, the question of whether cardiac-surgery patients differ from other surgical patients has been raised (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1994</LINK>). Therefore, the benefits of using a lower glycaemic target may be more profound amongst cardiothoracic surgery patients, particularly those with diabetes, than in general surgical patients.</P>
<P>This review will consider the evidence for the impact of glycaemic control (target blood glucose below the conventional target of 200 mg/dL) in the peri-operative period for prevention of surgical site infections. This review will evaluate whether the evidence supports the use of strict glycaemic control to normalize glucose levels to 110 mg/dL in both cardiac and general surgical patients without increasing harm due to hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, differences in outcome with other glycaemic targets between 110 and 200 mg/dL will be evaluated.</P>

<P>One glycaemic control regimen compared with at least one other glycaemic control regimen pre-, intra-, and/or post-operatively. Since conventional therapy is to treat glucose levels above 200 mg/dL, comparison was made between conventional treatment (of glucose values above ~200 mg/dL) and lower targets (with maximum of less than 200 mg/dL) or between two regimens evaluating glycaemic targets both below 200 mg/dL. Only glycaemic control regimens using medications to lower glucose levels (oral, subcutaneous, and/or intravenous) were included. A subgroup analysis was planned of studies using intravenous insulin as the lower targets for glycaemic control are not achievable in hyperglycaemic patients with oral medications or subcutaneous insulin alone, and insulin infusions have a higher theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia. Pre-operative glycaemic control will be limited to within one week before surgery as the effects of long-term glucose control on outcome is a separate question.</P>

<P>All five trials were reported to be randomised.

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> described a method of allocation concealment - sealed envelopes. None of the remaining trials described the method of allocation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding:</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials reported blinding of patients or healthcare providers to the treatment assignment. Given the differences in protocols between treatment arms in the trials, blinding of healthcare providers would have been difficult. Glucose levels or degree of glucose control was an outcome measure in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>) and was reported in all five trials. Lack of blinding of healthcare providers could have biased these results if glucose measurements were not obtained according to a strict protocol. In particular, <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> allowed for glucose measurements based on clinical judgment in addition to prespecified times in the algorithm.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> reported that outcome assessment was performed by trained, blinded personnel. The other three trials did not report blinding of outcome assessors. Outcomes such as mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>) were unlikely to have been affected by lack of blinding. However, assessment of other outcomes such as wound complications or infections (<LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>) could potentially have been influenced by knowledge of treatment group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Use of intention-to treat analysis:</HEADING>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK> did not state that they performed an ITT analysis, they also did not report any losses to follow up, withdrawals, or cross-overs. <LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> both specified an ITT analysis. However, Gandhi excluded 15 patients from the analysis due to lack of intra-operative hyperglycaemia. The decision to exclude these patients was based on a pre-defined objective criterion, lack of intra-operative hyperglycaemia &#8805; 100 mg/dL, and exclusion could not have been identified pre-operatively. Patients were excluded equally between groups. There is insufficient data to determine whether the excluded patients were significantly different from those included. The authors enrolled extra patients in each group in anticipation of this problem so as to maintain adequate power to detect a difference. <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK> had 7 patients cross over from one arm to the other during the study; all of these patients were excluded from the analysis. All 7 patients were in the subcutaneous insulin group originally and were dropped from the study by their primary physicians due to lack of adequate glucose control. Thus, their exclusion likely resulted in an underestimation of the benefits of continuous insulin infusion in obtaining glucose control and possibly in infection rates. Furthermore, although the overall mortality rate was low and would have been unlikely to have been significantly different amongst those 7 patients (the authors estimated that 2,842 patients would have been required to identify a difference in mortality), their mortality is nonetheless unreported.</P>

No data are provided regarding the similarity of those lost to follow up with those patients remaining in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> excluded 8 patients who were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge, in addition to 21 patients excluded after randomisation (15 non-hyperglycaemic patients and 6 patients whose surgery was cancelled). The 8 patients lost to follow-up were significantly younger than the other patients but otherwise did not differ in baseline characteristics. Gandhi also had missing 24 hour glucose data. The authors substituted 20-hour glucose data and demonstrated no difference in 20 and 24 hour glucose levels among patients with both data points.</P>

There were more nosocomial infections in the conventional glycaemic control group overall, as well as increases in specific types of infection. These increases were all statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) except for rates of UTIs and pneumonia. The authors reported a 4-fold increase in intravascular device infections and bloodstream infections in the conventional glycaemic control group. They also observed a 3.5 fold increase in intravascular device-related bloodstream infections and SSIs. Specific point estimates and confidence intervals were not provided. The authors state that they adjusted for the variable durations of stay of individual patients and presented as an infection rate per 1,000 patient ICU days, but these data are not reported in the study publication. The only report is a figure labelled percentage of patients. This trial was at moderate risk of bias with adequate sequence generation and no missing data but lacked reporting with respect to allocation concealment and blinding of the outcome assessor.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-08 13:53:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite biological plausibility and some evidence from observational cohort studies for an association between reduced surgical site infections and strict glycaemic control (usually defined as treatment of glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL), only five randomised controlled trials were identified that addressed the question of peri-operative glycaemic control and SSIs. These trials were all very different although all all patients had an initial postoperative stay in the intensive care unit. There was significant heterogeneity in the patient populations studied, in particular with regard to diabetes status,type of surgery and mortality risk. The glycaemic control regimens also differed significantly in terms of timing (intra-operative versus intra- and post-operative), duration of the study protocol post-operatively (12 hours to end of ICU stay), route of administration (continuous insulin infusion versus intravenous insulin infusion and push versus subcutaneous insulin), and target glucose ranges (maximum and minimum glucose levels, width of acceptable target range, and degree of overlap between study arms). Due to the heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate.</P>
<P>All five RCTs reported infection as an outcome measure however not all trials reported the rates of SSIs or only reported a subgroup of SSIs (such as deep sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery). Of the trials reporting SSIs, three had a baseline rate in the conventional glycaemic control group of less than or equal to 5%. None of these trials were individually powered to identify a difference with such a low baseline rate, likely accounting for the use of composite outcomes. The trials were too heterogeneous to combine. The other two trials that reported a difference in infection rates had much higher baseline infection rates and/or used a composite outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> had a baseline SSI rate of 30%, which likely reflects the severity of illness of the patients (as evidenced by the fact that 44% of patients in the standard group and 50% of patients in the strict glucose control group required vasopressors). <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK> also had a higher baseline rate of infection in the conventional therapy group, but did not specify how many of the infections were either pneumonia or SSI. Additionally, the higher baseline infection rate in the control arm may be due to a higher than conventionally acceptable mean glucose concentration in that group (above 200 mg/dL). Both studies had (at least) moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>In addition to the differences in the glycaemic control regimens used, post-operative nutrition protocols were either not described in detail or not described at all. Both baseline nutritional status and post-operative nutrition may have been potential confounders. Malnutrition as well as obesity are risk factors for infectious complications. No serum markers or anthropomorphic measurements of baseline nutritional status were reported. However, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK>) reported baseline Body Mass Indices (BMIs) for the randomised patients. The mean BMIs in all three studies were in the overweight range (25 to 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Additionally, post-operative nutrition can also affect outcome in that enteral nutrition is associated with fewer infectious complications and a shorter length of stay than parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Mazaki-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazaki 2008</LINK>). Two of the studies reported following standardized nutrition guidelines post-operatively, but did not describe the details (<LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK>). The other three studies were all in cardiac surgery patients; the composition of the post-operative diets were not described in detail, or whether differences existed based on diabetes status.</P>
<P>This review is unable to confirm the findings from observational cohort studies, most notably the Diabetic Portland Project. <LINK REF="REF-Furnary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnary 2004</LINK> which demonstrated a reduction in sternal wound infections, mortality, and hospital length of stay with progressive lowering of the target glucose range among diabetic cardiac surgery patients over time. One potential reason for the lack of effect of strict glycaemic control in the RCTs of cardiac surgery patients may be that the glycaemic control in the conventional group may have been lower than that in the historical cohorts in the observational studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> trial, which was the largest of the 5 trials reviewed and at low risk of bias, the mean 24 hour post-operative glucose level was less than 110 mg/dL in both groups. In the <LINK REF="REF-Furnary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnary 2004</LINK> study, maintenance of post-operative glucose levels in the 100 to 150 mg/dL range for 3 days improved outcome. Thus, both groups in the Gandhi trial were within the target range proposed by the Portland Project and demonstrated low sternal infection and mortality rates. Because of data from observational cohort studies, use of higher glycaemic targets in the conventional treatment arm (above 200 mg/dL), such as in the <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK> trial, may no longer be accepted.</P>
<P>Although not a primary outcome measure listed in the review protocol, theoretically, the same rationale for reduction in SSIs with strict glycaemic control should apply to other nosocomial infections. Because of differences in the infections recorded, data from the trials cannot be combined. <LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK> reported a composite infection outcome that included urinary tract infections, pneumonia and SSI, as a primary outcome measure and identified a large difference in infection rates between treatment arms. The generalisability of this trial may be limited however given that only patients undergoing emergent cerebral aneurysm clipping were enrolled and all patients received steroids. Thus, given the biologic plausibility and the difficulty of powering future trials on SSI rate alone, future trials should consider evaluating nosocomial infections as a primary outcome measure.</P>
<P>Hypoglycaemia rates and adequacy of glucose control are difficult to compare between studies for several reasons. The strict and conventional glycaemic control regimens not only differed in target ranges between the groups (except for <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK> which used the same target range for both groups) but also in the frequency of glucose measurements. The strict control groups received more blood glucose measurements than the conventional control groups, potentially resulting in a measurement bias, particularly when reported as percentage of hyper- or hypoglycaemic levels of the total. Additionally, studies differed in the reporting of hyper- and hypoglycaemia, using either the percentage of patients who experienced at least one episode of hyper/hypoglycaemia versus the percentage of glucose measurements greater or less than the cut-off value. Of the three studies that measured hypoglycaemia, all reported a higher rate of hypoglycaemia in the strict glycaemic control group, with <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> reporting 32% of patients having at least one episode of hypoglycaemia. None of the studies reported adverse outcomes secondary to hypoglycaemia.</P>
<P>In the Leuven trial of strict versus conventional insulin therapy in surgical ICU patients, <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 2001</LINK> identified a mortality reduction of 32% with intensive insulin therapy (or strict glycaemic control). The major reduction was in deaths due to a septic focus and multi-organ failure amongst patients receiving intensive insulin therapy for five or more days. None of the 5 RCTs included in this review included infection-related mortality as an outcome measure. Short-term all-cause mortality was not significantly different between treatment arms in any of the studies, although baseline risk factors were different due to very heterogeneous populations between studies. Whilst the all-cause mortality rate was twice as high in the conventional glycaemic control arm compared with the strict control arm in the <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> trial, this difference was not statistically significant, possibly due to lack of power. In the <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK> trial, there was no difference in 30-day mortality, but there was an increase in 2-year mortality in the no-GIK group due to cardiovascular complications. The death rate in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK> was too low to detect a difference (only four deaths overall). Future trials must consider the potential harms as well as benefits of strict glycaemic control.</P>
<P>The length of stay was shorter associated with strict glycaemic control in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK>) there being no difference in the remaining studies, although they are likely underpowered. <LINK REF="STD-Bilotta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bilotta 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gandhi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gandhi 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lazar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lazar 2004</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>) did not show a difference in mortality and, although not statistically significant, <LINK REF="STD-Grey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 2004</LINK> reported more deaths in the conventional glycaemic control group. </P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to support strict glycaemic control in the intra- and post-operative period among surgical patients for the prevention of SSIs. There are no randomised trials evaluating immediate pre-operative glycaemic control in any setting or intra-/post-operative glycaemic control in non-ICU patients. High quality evidence for strict glycaemic control in the intra- and/or post-operative period among surgical ICU patients, cardiac and non-cardiac, to reduce SSIs, independent of other potential benefits, is also lacking.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further large, adequately-powered, well-designed randomised trials are necessary to identify the ideal target for peri-operative glycaemic control in patients at high risk for SSIs. Future trials should report all nosocomial infections as well as SSIs. Given the heterogeneity seen in the included trials, it would appear that trials should be targeted at very specific populations and attempts to draw broader conclusions should not be made.</P>
