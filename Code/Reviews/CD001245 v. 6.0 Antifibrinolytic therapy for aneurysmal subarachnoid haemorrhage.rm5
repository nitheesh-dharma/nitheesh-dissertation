<TITLE MODIFIED="2013-02-06 12:32:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">Drugs for preventing blood clot dissolution (antifibrinolytic therapy) to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 12:47:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a bleed into the small space between the brain and skull that contains blood vessels that supply the brain (the subarachnoid space). The cause of a bleeding here is usually a rupture of a weak spot in one of these vessels. A SAH is a relatively uncommon type of stroke, but it often occurs at a young age (half the patients are younger than 50 years). The outcome of SAH is often poor: one-third of people die after the haemorrhage and of those who survive, one-fifth will require help for everyday activities. An important cause of poor recovery after SAH is a second bleed from the weakened vessel (rebleeding). This is thought to be caused by the dissolving of the blood clot at the original bleeding site that results from natural blood clot dissolving (fibrinolytic) activity. Antifibrinolytic therapy that reduces this activity was introduced as a treatment for reducing rebleeding and therefore for improving recovery after SAH. This review included 10 trials, totaling 1904 participants that investigated the effect of these drugs in people with SAH. Antifibrinolytic treatment does indeed reduce the risk of rebleeding, but does not improve survival or the chance of being independent in everyday activities. This may be due to an increase in one of the other common complications of SAH. We conclude that antifibrinolytic treatment should not routinely be given to people with SAH, but new randomised trials are needed to establish if short-term treatment might be beneficial.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 12:40:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to December 2012), and EMBASE (1947 to December 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing studies we searched reference lists and trial registers, performed forward tracking of relevant references and contacted drug companies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-13 10:18:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised trials comparing oral or intravenous antifibrinolytic drugs (tranexamic acid, epsilon amino-caproic acid, or an equivalent) with control in people with subarachnoid haemorrhage of suspected or proven aneurysmal cause.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:26:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Three review authors assessed trial quality. For the primary outcome we converted the outcome scales between good and poor outcome for the analysis. We scored death from any cause and rates of rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and hydrocephalus per treatment group. We expressed effects as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used random-effects models for all analyses. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-22 10:02:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 10 trials involving 1904 participants. The risk of bias was low in six studies. Four studies were open label and were rated as high risk of performance bias. One of these studies was also rated as high risk for attrition bias. Four trials reported on poor outcome (death, vegetative state, or severe disability) with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.15). All trials reported on death from all causes with a pooled RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). In a trial that combined short-term antifibrinolytic treatment (&lt; 72 hours) with preventative measures for cerebral ischaemia the RR for poor outcome was 0.85 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14). Antifibrinolytic treatment reduced the risk of re-bleeding reported at the end of follow-up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; 78 per 1000 participants), but there was heterogeneity (I² = 62%) between the trials. The pooled RR for reported cerebral ischaemia was 1.41 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.91, 83 per 1000 participants), again with heterogeneity between the trials (I² = 52%). Antifibrinolytic treatment showed no effect on the reported rate of hydrocephalus in five trials (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 12:44:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The current evidence does not support the use of antifibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, even in those who have concomitant treatment strategies to prevent cerebral ischaemia. Results on short-term treatment are promising, but not conclusive. Further randomised trials evaluating short-term antifibrinolytic treatment are needed to evaluate its effectiveness.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-05 16:53:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 16:53:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) rebleeding is an important cause of death and disability. Without aneurysm treatment approximately 30% of such people experienced a rebleed within one month of the initial haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Locksley-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locksley 1966</LINK>). The rebleeding rate has now been reduced to about 15% because in most people the aneurysm is occluded early after admission (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2000b</LINK>). The risk of rebleeding is highest in the first 24 hours after SAH, with a peak in the first six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2011</LINK>). The prognosis after rebleeding is poor: approximately 60% of people who rebleed die and another 30% remain dependent for activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-Naidech-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naidech 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P> </P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:20:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Antifibrinolytic drugs were introduced to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding. These drugs are administered orally or intravenously and block endogenous fibrinolytic activity and could help prevent bleeding.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-21 12:03:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Dissolution of the blood clot at the site of the ruptured aneurysm is thought to be an important factor in the development of rebleeding. This dissolution probably results from endogenous fibrinolytic activity after SAH. Since antifibrinolytic agents reduce fibrinolytic activity, antifibrinolytic therapy may reduce the occurrence of rebleeding and thereby improve clinical outcome after SAH. However, reducing rebleeding might not automatically improve clinical outcome in all instances. Concerns have been raised that antifibrinolytic therapy might increase the occurrence of cerebral ischaemia. Cerebral ischaemia is a complication of SAH that occurs in about 30% to 40% of people between four and 14 days after SAH. In older trials the beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic treatment (reducing rebleeding) was offset by an increase in cerebral ischaemia, resulting in a neutral effect on outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In 1967 Gibbs and O'Gorman published the first report on antifibrinolytic treatment in people with SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1967</LINK>). Since then, over 50 studies on antifibrinolytic therapy in aneurysmal SAH have been published. Unfortunately most of these studies are uncontrolled and only a minority of the controlled studies are randomised. Moreover, the results of some of the individual randomised studies contradict each other. Furthermore, as mentioned above, concerns have been raised that antifibrinolytic therapy might increase the occurrence of cerebral ischaemia. In a previous version of this review we found that even in people treated with measures to prevent and reverse cerebral ischaemia (such as administration of nimodipine), clinical outcome was not improved by antifibrinolytic treatment despite a reduction in rebleeding rate. The hypothesis has been posed that, when people with aneurysmal SAH are treated with antifibrinolytic agents, recovery from cerebral ischaemia is impeded by antifibrinolytic treatment. More recently it has been proposed that if antifibrinolytic treatment is discontinued before the period in which cerebral ischaemia typically occurs, the negative effect of antifibrinolytic therapy may be avoided. In this update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2003</LINK>), we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term antifibrinolytic treatment in people concomitantly treated with measures to prevent or reverse cerebral ischaemia.</P>

These 10 studies included 1904 participants of whom 959 were randomised to receive antifibrinolytic drugs, 597 received placebo treatment and 348 received control treatment. The <LINK REF="STD-Girvin-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Girvin 1973</LINK> study used epsilon-amino-caproic acid (39 participants), in all other studies tranexamic acid was used. In two studies participants were concomitantly treated with measures to prevent or reverse cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>). The duration of antifibrinolytic treatment differed considerably between studies and ranged from less than 72 hours up to six weeks. Short-term treatment was used in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>). In this study, participants were treated up to 72 hours after SAH. All other studies treated participants for at least 10 days (or until occlusion of the aneurysm) after SAH.</P>
<P>Clinical outcome was reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsementzis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tsementzis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1984</LINK>) and the number of participants with poor outcomes could be reconstructed. Death from all causes and rebleeding rates were reported in all 10 studies. In six studies, episodes of rebleeding were defined primarily by clinical symptoms.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fodstad-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fodstad 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>) reported CT scan or autopsy confirmed episodes of rebleeding. The Dutch-British trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1984</LINK>) and the STAR study (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>) defined and reported rebleeding in two ways: as 'probable' if the diagnosis was suspected solely on clinical grounds and as 'definite' when proven by CT (after comparison with an earlier CT) or at autopsy.</P>
<P>Cerebral ischaemia was reported in six studies but defined in only three: in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1984</LINK>) cerebral ischaemia was defined and reported in the same manner as episodes of rebleeding; as 'probable' and as 'definite' (CT-scan or autopsy confirmed) cerebral ischaemia. Again, as for rebleeding, <LINK REF="STD-Fodstad-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fodstad 1981</LINK> reported on CT-scan or autopsy confirmed cerebral ischaemia. <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK> reported percentage of transient and permanent delayed ischaemic neurological deficit. No clear definition was given and CT scans were not routinely used for confirmation of cerebral ischaemia. Because other studies did not make a distinction between permanent or transient cerebral ischaemia, we decided to combine these outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>, visible infarction on CT scan was reported; however, after contact with the author, we decided not to use this as a measure for cerebral ischaemia since this was not correlated to clinical signs of cerebral ischeamia.The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Girvin-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Girvin 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsementzis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tsementzis 1990</LINK>) made no distinction between participants with episodes clinically suggestive of cerebral ischaemia or participants with confirmed cerebral ischaemia, and reported only an all-inclusive number of participants. One study reported on 'delayed cerebral ischaemia' and 'post operative ischaemia' (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>). Since all other studies did not make this distinction and reported an overall number of participants with cerebral ischaemia, we grouped these subgroups of ischaemia together for the analysis on cerebral ischaemia.</P>
<P>Five trials reported on hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus was defined in only one study by means other than clinical grounds and could therefore be included in the sensitivity analysis concerning 'confirmed hydrocephalus' (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>). No trials reported on aneurysm treatment modality (i.e. coiling versus clipping) according to antifibrinolytic or control treatment and thus a subgroup analysis based on modality was not possible.<BR/>

In the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fodstad-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fodstad 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsementzis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tsementzis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rossum-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rossum 1977</LINK>) there was no follow-up information available for participants who were excluded after randomisation. In three studies only very few participants (<LINK REF="STD-Fodstad-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fodstad 1981</LINK>: n = 1; <LINK REF="STD-Tsementzis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tsementzis 1990</LINK>: n = 4; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rossum-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rossum 1977</LINK>: n = 3) were excluded from the final analysis and therefore these studies could still be included in our review. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>) 91 (15%) of the 596 participants were excluded after randomisation. Because this was less than the prespecified proportion of 20% we included this study in our analysis. We rated this study as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data.</P>
<P>Six studies used a double-blind method (placebo controlled) and four used a control group with standard treatment without placebo.The control group studies were open label and we rated them as high risk of performance bias (all four studies) and attrition bias (one study).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Girvin-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Girvin 1973</LINK> used 'flip-of-a-coin' randomisation as the method of allocation, which is more susceptible to bias compared with, for instance, the sealed envelope method. Nevertheless, we decided to include this study since this is an accepted form of randomisation with allocation concealment according to the Cochrane guidelines. All other studies used a method of concealed allocation that was considered appropriate at time of conducting the trial, although it was not always mentioned whether or not the sealed envelopes that were used were opaque.</P>

<P>In the analysis on rebleeding rates (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), antifibrinolytic therapy significantly reduced the risk of rebleeding (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; 78 per 1000 people). Considerable heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I² = 62%). Similar results were found in the subgroup analysis of the six double-blind and placebo controlled studies (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97), the sensitivity analysis including four studies with CT scan or autopsy confirmed rebleeding (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), as well as in the subgroup analysis of studies with and without ischaemia prevention according to duration of treatment (&lt; 72 hours &gt; 72 hours) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the six trials that reported cerebral ischaemia rates, antifibrinolytic treatment significantly increased the risk of cerebral ischaemia (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.91; 83 per 1000 people) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Similar (though non-significant) results were seen in the subgroup analysis of the three placebo controlled trials (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.19) as well as in the three trials with CT scan or autopsy confirmed cerebral ischaemia (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). In these analyses there was considerable heterogeneity between the results from the four older studies and the results from the most recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>), in which specific treatments to prevent cerebral ischaemia were used (I² = 52%).</P>
<P>In five trials hydrocephalus was reported. Antifibrinolytic treatment overall had no effect on the reported rates of hydrocephalus (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). In the subgroup analysis on placebo versus open studies the RR of antifibrinolytic treatment for hydrocephalus was 1.19 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.48) in the placebo controlled studies, while it was 0.64 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.18) in the open label trials.

Ischaemia prevention did not appear to have an effect on hydrocephalus in the subgroup analysis of studies with and without ischaemia prevention according to duration of treatment. The RR of hydrocephalus in people receiving antifibrinolytic treatment during &gt; 72 hours with cerebral ischaemia prevention was 1.17 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.55) and for people receiving antifibrinolytic treatment during &gt; 72 hours without ischaemia prevention the RR was 1.03 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:24:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although this systematic review shows that antifibrinolytic treatment reduces the rate of rebleeding by approximately 35%, there is no evidence of benefit from antifibrinolytic treatment on case fatality or poor overall outcome. This analysis further shows that the lack of effect on clinical outcome, despite a reduction in rebleeding, may be caused by an increase in cerebral ischaemia with antifibrinolytic treatment, which was also shown in the sensitivity analysis in trials with data on the number of participants with CT or post-mortem proven cerebral ischaemia (two double-blind, one with open control group). Any possible beneficial effect of the reduction in the rebleeding-rate on clinical outcome was offset by an increase in the rate of cerebral ischaemia. This was also seen in the most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>) in which short-term antifibrinolytic therapy was given with ischaemia preventative measures, although permanent delayed neurological deficit was decreased with antifibrinolytic treatment. This finding could suggest that short-term antifibrinolytic treatment (compared to long-term treatment in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>) does not influence recovery from initial ischaemia or development of secondary ischaemia and may, therefore, lead to improved clinical outcome. However, confirmatory evidence is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:24:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Trials in which people were included with symptoms and signs of SAH of suspected or proven aneurysmal cause, with confirmation of the diagnosis by the presence of subarachnoid blood on CT or on CSF examination were eligible for inclusion in the review. We chose this pragmatic approach and did not restrict our review to people with angiographically proven aneurysms, because in contrast to angiography, CT scan or CSF examination can be done instantaneously, independent of the clinical condition of the patient. One could argue that currently people with suspected aneurysmal SAH will undergo CT angiography (CT-A) immediately to confirm the presence of an aneurysm. We chose not to limit our analysis to proven aneurysmal SAH, because CT-A was not available at the time most of the trials were conducted. Moreover, CT-A is not always available in referring hospitals without specialised units. Since antifibrinolytic treatment might be most beneficial when started as soon as possible, it is likely that treatment will start in the referring hospital without CT-A confirmation of the presence of an aneurysm. An analysis on oral versus intravenous treatments or a comparison between treatment dosages could not be performed. Only one study used oral antifibrinolytic treatment, whereas other studies used intravenous therapy alone or a combination of intravenous and oral treatment in varying dosages. Furthermore, in the past decade treatment of cerebral aneurysms has changed considerably: whereas most studies were performed in the era where surgical treatment was the only method of occlusion of the aneurysm, currently endovascular coiling is an accepted alternative to surgical occlusion. Because no data on treatment modality were available from the included trials, an analysis according to aneurysm treatment modality was not possible. Such an analysis could, however, prove worthwhile in the future.</P>

<P>In this systematic review we only included true randomised controlled trials and performed a subgroup analysis on masked versus unmasked studies in an attempt to minimise allocation and performance bias. However, many of the included studies were older (1970s and 1980s) and most did not report on many sources of potential bias, such as how the randomisation sequence was generated and if participant outcome was assessed by individuals who were blinded to the intervention given. Therefore, we scored many potential sources of bias as 'unclear risk' as can be seen in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. However, most of these studies were small and in total comprised 24% of all included participants. Most included participants originated from three large studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1984</LINK>). For two of these studies, comprising 50% of all data, we could find no potential sources of bias so we rated them as low risk of bias for each source (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1984</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2002</LINK>, however, many potential sources of bias could not be scored and were unclear, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinded outcome assessment. Moreover, 15% of included participants were later excluded from the analysis and the baseline characteristics and outcome of these participants were not reported. Since this was the only study included in the subgroup analysis for treatment duration of less than 72 hours with ischaemia prevention these results are far from conclusive. We know of only one other case series that evaluated short-term antifibrinolytic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Harrigan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrigan 2010</LINK>). In this study all participants received antifibrinolytic treatment until occlusion of the aneurysm (average 56.5 hours after SAH ictus). <LINK REF="REF-Harrigan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrigan 2010</LINK> reported low rebleeding rates and permanent neurological deficit due to cerebral ischaemia (1.4% and 7.2% respectively). However, no follow-up was done to evaluate the participants' clinical outcomes and no control group was available making it impossible to draw conclusions based on this study.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:24:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched all major medical electronic databases and other sources, using sensitive and validated search strategies. However, it is possible that we did not find all relevant publications. Furthermore, we only included studies that were published in medical literature and did not search the grey literature, such as government reports and unpublished information. Although all included trials met the predefined inclusion criteria, the studies differed considerably in participant selection, disease severity at baseline, start of treatment after diagnosis, dosage and type of trial medication, classification of events, and outcome and duration of follow-up. This clinical heterogeneity may in part account for the statistical heterogeneity found in the analyses on rebleeding and cerebral ischaemia.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-08-19 11:25:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our results are comparable to the results from a recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gaberel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaberel 2012</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="REF-Gaberel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaberel 2012</LINK> included all studies in which antifibrinolytic treatment was compared with control treatment, including retrospective analyses and studies with historical control groups. Retrospective analyses are known to be much more susceptible to selection and reporting bias, since the decision to treat a patient is made subjectively. Moreover, the other review did not compare placebo controlled versus open studies, which is another potential source of bias, since all outcomes, except for death, are made on subjective clinical grounds and can be easily biased when the outcome assessor is not blinded to the treatment given. In our review we included only randomised clinical trials and performed several sensitivity analyses, which should yield less biased results. Since most studies did not describe whether outcomes were assessed blinded to treatment, sensitivity analyses are essential. Despite the fact that all authors reported that confirmation of rebleeding was sought, in most instances this was done by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. Because CSF examination is an unreliable test to confirm rebleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 1983</LINK>) the diagnosis of rebleeding could often not be regarded as proven. The sensitivity analyses we performed on reported versus confirmed (with confirmatory evidence on CT scan or at autopsy) rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, or hydrocephalus showed similar results to the overall analyses. Lack of confirmatory evidence of these complications thus appears to be of minor importance in our analyses. The analyses we performed on trials with control treatment compared with those given placebo treatment showed similar reducing effects of antifibrinolytic treatment on rebleeding and similar increasing effects on cerebral ischaemia, whereas hydrocephalus trials with control treatment showed a tendency towards a beneficial effect compared with trials with placebo treatment, demonstrating a tendency towards increased hydrocephalus rates.</P>

<P>Antifibrinolytic treatment does not improve clinical outcome in people after SAH, although it does reduce the risk of rebleeding after SAH. Based on the currently available data, treatment with antifibrinolytic drugs cannot be recommended for people with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a presumed or proven aneurysmal origin.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-30 12:09:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data suggest that short-term (less than 72 hours) antifibrinolytic treatment, combined with cerebral ischaemia preventative measures, may reduce rebleeding rates without an increase in the proportion of people with cerebral ischaemia. Thus, short-term treatment with antifibrinolytic therapy may be effective for people with aneurysmal SAH, but confirmatory evidence is lacking and a possible harmful effect can also not be excluded. Based on these findings new randomised trials of short-term antifibrinolytic agents versus control in people with SAH are needed. Recently, a new trial comparing ultra early and short antifibrinolytic treatment (less than 24 hours) with control treatment has been registered and is planned (<LINK REF="STD-Verbaan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Verbaan 2012</LINK>).</P>
