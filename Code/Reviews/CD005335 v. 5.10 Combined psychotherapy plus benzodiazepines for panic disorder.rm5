<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 19:46:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Panic disorder is characterised by the repeated occurrence of unexpected panic attacks, during which the individual experiences a strong fear with anticipation of death. These attacks are often accompanied by somatic symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea or faintness. Those suffering from panic disorder have persistent anticipatory fear of recurrent attacks and feel anxious even while they have no occurrence of panic attacks for a certain period. Panic disorder is strongly associated with an increased risk for agoraphobia and depression. The prevalence of panic disorder is reported to be around 2 to 3 percent in the general population. Two broad categories of treatment have been shown to be effective in treating panic disorder, one being pharmacotherapy with antidepressants or benzodiazepines, the other being psychotherapy. These treatments are often combined, yet the efficacy of combining psychotherapy and benzodiazepine for panic disorder is unclear, despite its widespread use. This review included randomised controlled trials comparing the combination of psychotherapy and a benzodiazepine with either the psychotherapy or the benzodiazapine alone for people with panic disorder. We were able to include only three trials in this review. Two could be used in the comparison of the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepine versus psychotherapy alone and one in the comparison of the combination with benzodiazepine. These comparisons involved just 166 patients and 77 patients, respectively. These small numbers make it difficult to detect any differences between combination treatments and either treatment alone. The trials which compared the combination of treatments with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy) indicated no differences in response between the two approaches, either during the intervention, at the end of the intervention, or at the last follow-up time point. The trial which compared the combination of treatments with a benzodiazepine alone demonstrated no differences in response during the intervention. Although the combination of treatments appeared to be more effective than the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment, no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up. Before evidence-based treatment recommendations are possible, more randomised controlled trials are required, comparing the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepines with either treatment alone, and involving enough people to be able to detect a true difference between the treatments if one exists.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 01:50:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials met eligibility criteria. A 16-week behaviour therapy intervention was used in two trials, and a 12-week cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention in the third. Duration of follow-up varied, ranging from 0 to 12 months.<BR/>Two trials (total 166 participants) provided data comparing combination with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy). No statistically significant differences were observed in response during the intervention (relative risk (RR) for combination 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.03, P = 0.35), at the end of the intervention (RR 0.78, 0.45 to 1.35, P = 0.37), or at the last follow-up time point, although the follow-up data suggested that the combination might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08).<BR/>One trial (77 participants) compared combination with a benzodiazepine alone. No differences were found in response during the intervention (RR 1.57, 0.83 to 2.98, P = 0.17). Although the combination appeared to be superior to the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment (RR 3.39, 1.03 to 11.21, P = 0.05) the finding was only borderline statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up (RR 2.31, 0.79 to 6.74, P = 0.12).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 19:50:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Panic disorder is characterised by the repeated occurrence of unexpected panic attacks, during which the individual experiences strong fear with anticipation of death. These attacks are often accompanied by somatic symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea or faintness. Those suffering from panic disorder have persistent anticipatory fear of recurrent attacks and feel anxious even while they have no occurrence of panic attacks for a certain period. Applying recent diagnostic criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), epidemiological studies have reported annual prevalence at 2.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1994</LINK>), 2.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Carlbring-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlbring 2002</LINK>) and 2.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Panic disorder is strongly associated with an increased risk for agoraphobia and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savino-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savino 1993</LINK>). One third to one-half of individuals diagnosed with panic disorder in community samples also have agoraphobia, although a much higher rate of agoraphobia is encountered in clinical samples (<LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1997</LINK>). Agoraphobia is thought to be the severest of all phobic disorders, because it causes its patients to avoid common activities such as going outside. On the other hand, a lifetime prevalence of major depression of 50-60% in patients suffering from panic disorder has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1998</LINK>). Such patients with comorbid depression are at higher risk for suicide attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1989</LINK>). It is therefore imperative to establish a good evidence base to guide the treatment of panic disorder.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 20:18:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two broad categories of treatment have been shown to be effective in treating panic disorder; one is pharmacotherapy using antidepressants and benzodiazepines, the other is psychotherapy, and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in particular (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2002</LINK>). Benzodiazepines have some benefits, in that they lead to therapeutic effects on panic attacks earlier than antidepressants or psychotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Andersch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersch 1991</LINK>) and the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines are fewer than for antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Rickels-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickels 1998</LINK>). Nevertheless, the use of benzodiazepines has been associated with sedation, reduced coordination, cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2004</LINK>), increased accident proneness (<LINK REF="REF-Neutel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neutel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neutel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neutel 1996</LINK>) and development of dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1998</LINK>). It has also been reported that a rebound of panic attacks can occur during taper (<LINK REF="REF-Pecknold-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecknold 1988</LINK>). Antidepressants and benzodiazepines have been shown to have equivalent efficacy for controlling panic attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Andersch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersch 1991</LINK>), but it is increasingly recognized that pharmacotherapy alone tends to result in high relapse rates, not only when discontinued (<LINK REF="REF-Mavissakalian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavissakalian 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pecknold-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecknold 1988</LINK>), but even when maintained at adequate dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toni 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Psychotherapy has also been reported to be effective in treating panic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Addis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenardy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenardy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ito-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telch-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telch 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1996</LINK>) and provides a potential alternative to the use of benzodiazepines without any adverse drug effects. Current approaches in CBT include exposure-based procedures (with interoceptive elements for treating panic and exposure in vivo for treating agoraphobia) and cognitive restructuring (<LINK REF="REF-Mitte-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitte 2005</LINK>). However, there is some suggestion that psychotherapy may not completely prevent relapses in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fava-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fava 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 20:43:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the advantages of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy when used individually, and the drawbacks associated with both, the two treatment modalities are often combined, and combinations of psychotherapy and benzodiazepines are widely used in clinical practice. For example, in a specialized clinic for cognitive-behaviour therapy, over three quarters of the patients were also given benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Starcevic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starcevic 2004</LINK>). However, little evidence currently exists to demonstrate whether there is any additional benefit in combining the two treatments compared with either treatment alone and, if there is, that this benefit outweighs any disadvantages or risks associated with the additional therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Spiegel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiegel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardle-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardle 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westra-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westra 1998</LINK>). For example, some observational studies have suggested that benzodiazepines actually interfered with cognitive-behavioural interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otto-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Balkom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Balkom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westra-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westra 2002</LINK>), while others have suggested otherwise (<LINK REF="REF-Hegel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oei-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oei 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is clearly a need for more precise and methodologically rigorous evidence on efficacy of combined therapy in comparison with either of its component therapies alone, both in the short-term and the long-term after treatment has ended.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Electronic search of CCDAN Controlled Trials Registers</HEADING>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Registers (CCDAN REGISTERS) on October 11, 2005. This comprehensive register is updated regularly adding the results on searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1982-), PsycINFO (1974-), PSYNDEX (1977-) and LILACS (1982-1999) and handsearches of major psychiatric, medical journals, conference proceedings and trial registers. Using the full article of relevant trials, records in this register are regularly coded with respect to characteristics of trials, such as the kind of interventions and their concomitant use. Trials already coded are stored in CCDANCTR-Studies. Trials where this coding process is ongoing are stored in CCDANCTR-References. We separately searched the relevant trials in these registers (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Although this is a very slowly developing field, further searches of these registers are being undertaken during November 2008 to plan the frequency of future updates.</P>

<P>Although subgroup analyses should be performed and interpreted with caution because multiple analyses lead to false positive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>), we planned to perform the following subgroups analyses at the study level, where possible, for the following a priori reasons.</P>
<P>1. For each type of psychotherapy separately (cognitive-behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy, behaviour therapy, and psychodynamic therapy and others), because they may not, a priori, have the same degree of efficacy when administered alone or the same degree of combinability with pharmacotherapy</P>
<P>2. For patients with agoraphobia and for those without agoraphobia, because the same treatment may have differential efficacy with regard to panic and agoraphobia</P>
<P>3. For patients with and without depressive disorder, because it is likely that benzodiazepines may confer more benefit for those patients with panic disorder co-morbid with depression, especially in their anxiety symptoms</P>
<P>We did not plan any subgroup analysis with regard to different types of benzodiazepines. Although there are many studies that have reported efficacy of high-potency benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and alprazolam, there are also studies suggesting that low-potency benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are no less effective (<LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>5. By limiting to trials where a quality control of the administered psychotherapy was adequate, because therapists' adherence to the model of psychotherapy was considered important to result in its true effects. The adequacy of the psychotherapy was assessed as follows. A sensitivity analysis was done by limiting to trials with the rating of 'A' or 'B'.</P>
<P>A. When the conduct of psychotherapy was examined by a third author through audiotapes etc, and when the authors gave sufficiently detailed description of the therapy procedure in the text or provided the information of the treating manual.<BR/>B.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-18 14:47:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite extensive literature searches and personal communication, only three studies were identified that examined combined benzodiazepines and psychotherapy for panic disorder.</P>
<P>The combined therapy does not seem to provide a significant advantage over psychotherapy alone either during, or at the end of treatment. Data from two trials suggested that the combination of behaviour therapy and benzodiazepine might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone in the long-term naturalistic follow-up up to 6-12 months (RR 0.62, 95%CI 0.36 to 1.07; P = 0.08) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The small amount of evidence available for comparing the combination of a psychotherapy and a benzodiazepine comes from one trial. The data from this trial suggests that psychotherapy (in this case, behaviour therapy (using exposure)) plus a benzodiazepine may be superior to a benzodiazepine alone at the end of intervention treatment (RR 3.39, 95%CI 1.03 to 11.21 P = 0.05) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 04:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only three trials were identified, only two of which could contribute data to the primary outcomes of the review. All the secondary outcomes were not reported due to possible bias including incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting. Strong recommendations for the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepines in clinical practice should be avoided and readers of this review should be cautious about the interpretation of these results.</P>
<P>However, on the basis of these, albeit limited findings, for those who have access to appropriate behaviour therapy services, treatment with a benzodiazepine alone might not be warranted. Furthermore, although we were able to draw little information about adverse effects from these trials, psychotherapy alone might be more favourable than the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepine, considering the long-term adverse outcomes such as cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2004</LINK>) and development of dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) with benzodiazepine use.</P>
<P>We did not focus on the combined antidepressants and psychotherapy in the present review, but our companion systematic review on this topic also concluded that either combined therapy or psychotherapy alone rather than antidepressants alone might be chosen as first-line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2007</LINK>). Combining the conclusions of the two reviews, where psychotherapy is available, pharmacotherapy alone, be it an antidepressant or a benzodiazepine, might be best avoided for the treatment of panic disorder.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-13 04:29:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some possible limitations of this review should be noted. First of all, only three studies including 293 patients were identified. Type II errors were therefore likely, and even the significant results might have limited generalisability.</P>
<P>Secondly, the generalisability of these findings beyond specialist psychiatric settings is not straightforward. The included studies were conducted at psychiatric hospitals under psychiatrists' and clinical psychologists' administration (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>) or a psychiatric clinic in a university hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1997</LINK>). Therefore, the applicability of these findings to primary care settings might be questioned. Another concern about the generalisability of this review may arise from the fact that participants were limited to those having been able to tolerate being off medication before entering the study in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>). In addition, regarding use of benzodiazepines, one included study employed a huge daily dose of alprazolam in both the benzodiazepine arms (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>) compared to the dose usually recommended in clinical practice, and this could have had negative effects on these arms. One of the other included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>) used diazepam as the benzodiazepine, but in a relatively lower dose compared to previous studies that involved diazepam as treatment for panic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Pohl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1996</LINK>). Although diazepam has been demonstrated not only superior to pill-placebo, but also equally effective compared with alprazolam (<LINK REF="REF-Dunner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1996</LINK>), this issue could have diminished efficacy of diazepam and have diluted differences between combined therapy and psychotherapy alone.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the definition of "response" employed in the present study differs from study to study, due to reported outcomes in the original reports. Clinical global rating was employed in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>) and phobic avoidance scale in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>). We were not able to extract the data for the response outcome from the last one (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1997</LINK>), due to lack of information about the global severity of panic disorder. The proportions of responders are much smaller in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>) than the other (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1993</LINK>), possibly due to different definitions of response. Although no significant heterogeneity has been observed through the analyses in the present review, one might think these definitions are arbitrary or plausible. However, we failed to obtain clinical global scale in the latter (<LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>) in spite of contacting the original authors. We therefore utilized only phobic avoidance scale to define the response, since this has been shown to better represent the patients' global status (<LINK REF="REF-Basoglu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basoglu 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the other hand, the present review may have several strengths. First, we performed a systematic and comprehensive search for the relevant trials. All references to possible candidate studies were investigated to identify relevant ones. The authors of the included studies were contacted to give more information about their studies and other possibly relevant ones. Consequently, our analyses managed to include some unpublished data (MAL) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wardle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wardle 1994</LINK>). Second, though there are many narrative reviews on efficacy of combination therapy against either monotherapy that included both high-quality and low-quality studies all together, we limited our systematic review only to high quality RCTs. These RCTs were also conducted while keeping assessors blind. Our approach minimised bias and therefore offered more rigorous evidence. Third, we applied strict ITT principle, by means of imputing response rates from continuous measures of global severity for panic disorder and counting all the dropouts as non-responders, as we were interested in the fate of all patients who began the acute phase after randomisation, not just those who completed it. Counting dropouts as non-responders might appear too stringent as some dropouts may have improved, but we cannot confirm their percentage. Given this circumstance, this approach is the most conservative estimate of the response rate, and in the absence of any stronger and more rational alternative, we decided to remain conservative with regard to either treatment arm.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-13 04:37:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some authors have argued that the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepines is superior to psychotherapy alone in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westra-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westra 2002</LINK>). However the results of this review failed to support these arguments, in terms of both the response rate (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08) and the secondary outcome representing global severity of panic attacks (SMD 0.19, -0.22 to 0.59, P = 0.37). The combined therapy does not seem to lead to significant difference from psychotherapy alone during and at the end of the intervention. Indeed, the data from the 6-12 month naturalistic follow-up summarised in this review indicated that it might even be inferior to psychotherapy alone.</P>

<P>Although based on only a small number of studies yielding limited data and little information about adverse effects, the analyses presented here might indicate that combined therapy is superior to exposure therapy alone during treatment, although not necessarily after the treatment has ended. These analyses might also suggest that, where behaviour therapy is available, a benzodiazepine alone should not be considered in the treatment of panic disorder.</P>
