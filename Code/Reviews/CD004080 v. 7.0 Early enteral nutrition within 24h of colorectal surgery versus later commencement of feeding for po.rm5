<P>There is no obvious advantage in keeping patients 'nil by mouth' following gastrointestinal surgery, and this review support the notion on early commencement. The review implicated lower incidence of several post operative complications. The immediate advantage of caloric intake could be a faster recovery with fewer complications. Length of hospital stay was reduced in nine out of fourteen studies. Overall reduction corresponded to about a day, which is both clinically and economically important. Reduction in complication rates may explain this observation as might faster return of gastrointestinal function upon early commencement of enteral feeding.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:45:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review from 2011 focus on early postoperative enteral nutrition after gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consist of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids when tolerated. Although several trials have implicated lower incidence of septic complications and faster wound healing upon early enteral feeding, other trials have shown opposite results. The immediate advantage of caloric intake could be a faster recovery with fewer complications, to be evaluated systematically.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition compared to traditional management (no nutritional supply) is associated with fewer complications in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-01-10 16:32:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED, EMBASE, and LILACS from 1979 (first RCT published) to November 2009.<BR/>We manually scanned the references from the relevant articles, and consulted primary authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCT's) comparing early commencement of feeding (within 24 hours) with no feeding in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery.<BR/>Early enteral nutrition is defined as all oral intakes (i.e. registered oral intake, supplemented oral feeding) and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal) containing caloric content. No feeding is traditional management, defined as none caloric oral intake or any kind of tube feeding before bowel function. The definition 'no nutrition' includes non caloric placebo and water.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:47:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors independently assessed the identified trials and extracted the relevant data. Primary end points of interest were: Wound infections and intraabdominal abscesses, postoperative complications such as acute myocardial infarction, postoperative thrombosis or pneumonia, anastomotic leakages, mortality, length of hospital stay, and significant adverse effects.<BR/>We combined data to estimate the common relative risk of postoperative complications, and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used fixed effects model (risk ratios to summarise the treatment effect) whenever feasible. The treatment effect on length of stay was estimated using effect size (presented as mean +/- SD). Some outcomes were not analysed but presented in a descriptive way. We used a random effects model to estimate overall risk ratio and effect size.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:49:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen randomised controlled trials representing a total of 1224 patients all undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Individual clinical complications failed to reach statistical significance, but the direction of effect indicates that earlier feeding may reduce the risk of post surgical complications. Mortality was the only outcome showing a significant benefit, but not necessarily associated with early commencement of feeding, as the reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, reoperation, and acute myocardial infarction.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although non-significant results, there is no obvious advantage in keeping patients 'nil by mouth' following gastrointestinal surgery, and this review support the notion on early commencement of enteral feeding.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:50:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of early postoperative enteral nutrition after colorectal surgery is controversial. Surgical patients are often malnourished (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McWhirter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhirter 1994</LINK>), which may cause increased morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Vet_x0027_s-Affairs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vet's Affairs 1991</LINK>). Prior to surgery patients are often feel nauseas or are starved for investigations. After surgery there is classically a period of being 'nil by mouth' before fluids then solids are gradually introduced. Within 24h of starvation changes in the bodies metabolism are evident including increased insulin resistance and reduced muscle function. Experimental data from both humans and animals (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuzawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuzawa 2007</LINK>) suggests that providing nutrition in the postoperative period improves wound healing (relevant to the integrity of the intestinal anastomosis), muscle function and reduces sepsis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that early enteral nutrition is useful for recovering gastrointestinal motility and maintaining the nutritional status for patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 2009</LINK>).<BR/>In a meta-analysis of studies comparing enteral versus parenteral nutrition, those patients receiving enteral nutrition had a lower incidence of septic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1992</LINK>). Other studies have shown improved wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1991</LINK>) and reduced sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>) with enteral nutrition.<BR/>The first randomised study to show jejunal feeding was tolerated within 24 hours of surgery was published in 1979 and showed a reduced length of hospital stay in patients fed early (<LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>). Subsequently there have been other studies giving mixed results (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Everitt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everitt 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Therefore, clinical trials have not convincingly established a benefit for early post-operative enteral nutrition following colorectal surgery and conclusively the use of early postoperative enteral nutrition still remains controversial.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-01-19 10:56:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review based on randomised controlled trials (RCT's) examined whether there is evidence that early enteral nutrition following gastrointestinal surgery, mainly colorectal, is of clinical benefit. We included upper GI topics from trials reporting both lower and upper GI surgery sites.<BR/>Early enteral nutrition is defined as all oral intakes (i.e. registered oral intake, supplemented oral feeding) and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal) containing caloric content commenced within 24 hours postoperatively. Trials reporting enteral nutrition given after the cut off 24 hours postoperatively, is not included in the meta-analyses, but reviewed separately.<BR/>The control arm is an effect of traditional management, defined as none caloric oral intake or any kind of tube feeding before bowel function. The definition 'No nutrition' includes non caloric placebo and water.</P>
<P>This review examines the following clinical questions, whether early postoperative enteral nutrition compared to no nutritional supply is associated with</P>
<P>1. Reduced number of wound infections and intraabdominal abscesses.<BR/>2. Reduced number of postoperative complications, such as acute myocardial infarction, postoperative thrombosis or pneumonia.<BR/>3. Reduced number of anastomotic leakages<BR/>4. Lower mortality within 30 days postoperatively<BR/>5. Shorter length of stay at hospitals<BR/>6. Significant adverse effects.</P>
<P>As the vast majority of patients admitted elective surgery for severe gastrointestinal conditions are in poor nutritional condition, it is unlikely to perform subgroup analyses on the effects of malnourished versus well-nourished patients. However, if possible this will be performed or commented on in the discussion.<BR/>The review will not analyse cost effectiveness.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as well as unpublished, of early postoperative enteral tube feeding or supplemented postoperative oral feeding in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Trials must compare enteral feeding or supplemented oral feeding with no food (placebo) or a registered oral intake. Studies on parenteral nutrition will be excluded from this review. Trials will be considered despite lack of blinding or placebo treatment.<BR/>Studies reporting comparison of treatment between parenteral, enteral nutrition and controls will be included only if data can be provided separately for patients in enteral feeding group and control group. Studies with multiple arms will be included if data allow a solid distinction in between each single group. Unpublished studies and abstracts will be considered and included if we are able to obtain complete manuscripts from the author(s).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A data extraction sheet was developed before identification of trials, and was not deviated from during the review process. It informs on methodology, objectives, intervention, patients, and outcome. <BR/>The authors (HKA, SJL, ST) independently quality assessed all identified primary studies, review articles, or other, and decided whether they should be included in the review. Reviewers independently abstracted data on methodology and outcomes from each study, checked for duplicates, and scored each trial using the modified version of the previously published scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1998</LINK>) to assess methodological quality. Disagreements were resolved in consensus.</P>
<P>The modified methodological quality assessment criteria and score system describes:</P>
<P>a. Randomisation (described and concealed (2 points) or not sure (1 point))<BR/>b. Analysis (intention to treat (2 points) or other (0 points))<BR/>c. Blinding (triple, double, single or not blinded - (3, 2, 1, 0 points)<BR/>d. Patient selection (consecutive eligible (2 points) or selected or unable to tell (0 points))<BR/>e. Description of outcomes (fully defined (2 points), partly defined (1 point) or not defined (0 points))<BR/>f. Baseline comparisons for groups of patients (yes (1 point) or no (0 points) - 2/3 or more means "yes" and less means "no")</P>
<P>As RCT's with inadequate allocation concealment might produce significant exaggerated estimates of intervention effects compared to RCT's reporting adequate concealment, heterogeneity was tested for in a subgroup analyse comparing studies with a higher methodological score to those with a lower score. </P>
<P>We combined data to estimate the common relative risk (RR) of postoperative complications, and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. In this review, p value &lt; 0.01 is considered to be statistically significant. Higher P values (&lt;0.05) will be considered as trending towards statistically significance. For analysis, we used fixed effects model (risk ratios to summarise the treatment effect) whenever feasible. The treatment effect on length of stay was estimated using effect size (presented as mean +/- SD). Some outcomes were not analysed but presented in a descriptive way. We used a random effects model to estimate overall risk ratio and effect size. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-01-19 10:58:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the review, first published in 2006. The searches performed November 2009 revealed 8 new eligible studies for inclusion, of which only one study was included (<LINK REF="STD-Lucha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucha 2005</LINK>). The original searches revealed 38 potentially relevant trials, of which seventeen randomised controlled trials were identified as fitting our inclusion criteria. Although adequately allocation concealment described, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hoover-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hoover 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1981</LINK>) were excluded because no information on relevant outcomes was reported and attempts to obtain unpublished data from the authors were unsuccessful. Data on clinical complications from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>) were not extractable.</P>
<P>Fourteen trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria and is presented in this review summary statistics.<BR/>From each study we collected data on methodology, clinical gastrointestinal conditions, and outcomes. Additional unpublished data was obtained for seven of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulrooney-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrooney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reissman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reissman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smedley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smedley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>). First study was published in 1979 (<LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>).<BR/>Mandatory for inclusion in this review, all trials reported commencement of feeding within the first 24 hours post surgery. In four of the included studies, feeding was started within six hours after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watters 1997</LINK>).<BR/>The fourteen included studies all describe early enteral feeding after elective gastrointestinal surgery, but with a wide variety of gastrointestinal conditions. Nine trials reported patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery solely (<LINK REF="STD-Binderow-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Binderow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartsell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartsell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulrooney-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrooney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reissman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reissman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smedley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smedley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucha 2005</LINK>). Four studies included mixed site of surgery (upper and lower gastrointestinal), of which three reported lower GI surgery predominantly (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watters 1997</LINK>), whereas one study reported upper GI or hepatobiliary as the predominant intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>). One study did not report site of surgery, but used the term 'intestinal resection' without specification (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1996</LINK>). Seven studies did not state the underlying pathology of the study participants, whereas the six remaining trials included both benign and malignant conditions. Thirty one patients from five trials underwent abdominoperineal resections or stoma creation and had no anastomosis. In seven studies patients in the intervention group were fed directly into the small bowel, and in the remaining six studies patients were fed orally, as illustrated in table 01 (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This table also gives an overview of the study characteristics regarding pathology, feed type, and primary reported outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Six studies reported concealment of allocation of treatment (sealed envelopes) and blinding adequately (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulrooney-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrooney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smedley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smedley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watters 1997</LINK>). One trial used an open table with random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>), but in the remaining seven included studies the exact method of randomisation was either unclear or not stated at all.<BR/>Outcome assessment was only explicitly stated in the report by <LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>.<BR/>The fourteen randomised trials identified were clinically heterogeneous, and most of them were small and of doubtful methodological quality. Combination trials that differ in terms of underlying condition, operation, and intervention may be inappropriate. However, we were interested in the pragmatic comparison of early versus deferred feeding strategies after gastrointestinal surgery and not in differences between feed types or specific routes of feeding. It is noteworthy that the effect of early nutrition seemed to be homogeneous across a set of trials that were clearly heterogeneous in clinical terms. Our ability to detect heterogeneity between trials, however, was limited by the small number of trials and by the often inadequate reporting. For example, definition of the patients' pre-existing nutritional state and severity of underlying disease was generally poor. The method of randomisation and blinding of outcome assessment was also not described in sufficient detail, which means that uncertainty regarding the methodological quality of trials remains. In particular, the identical or closely similar number of patients in comparison groups in these trials must be of concern. This could occur only if blocked randomisation with a small block size had been used. Blocked or stratified randomisation, however, was only mentioned in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watters 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 10:55:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The fourteen randomised controlled trials represent a total of 1224 patients, all undergoing gastrointestinal surgery but with a wide variety of clinical GI conditions (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).<BR/>Our initial definition of lower gastrointestinal surgery was where an anastomosis was formed distal to the ligament of Treitz. It was impossible to identify individual patients in any of the trials to exclude them. Thus being pragmatic we included all the patients according to <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.<BR/>The effects of early feeding on wound infection, intraabdominal abscess, anastomotic dehiscence, mortality, and pneumonia are analysed and presented in the table of comparisons. By contacting the authors of the primary trials, we received additional data from seven of the fourteen trials, described previously and notified in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Wound infection</B> was an outcome in nine studies, and reported in seven of the included studies.<BR/>Absolute risks ranged from 0% (0/40) to 13,4% (13/97) in the treatment groups and from 0% (0/16) to 33,3% (10/30) in the control groups. Using the Mantel-Haenszel methods for calculating the combined relative risk, RR was 0,77 (0.48 to 1,22), with some heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 10,39, P=0.26). Although close to be significant within the 95% CI, the study by Beier-Holgersen (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>) differ from the seven other studies by having a considerable high proportion of numbers of patients with wound infection in the control group. A sub-group analysis without this study (not presented) revealed less heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 5,70, P=0,46) and a RR 0,78 (0,45 to 1.35).</P>
<P>
<B>Intraabdominal abscess</B> was reported in ten studies, of which five studies reported events:<BR/>Absolute risks ranged from 0% (0/36) to 13% (2/15) in both the early feeding groups and the control groups. The combined relative risk (RR) for this outcome was 0,87 (0.31 to 2,42), with very little heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1,45, P=0.84).</P>
<P>
<B>Anastomotic leak/dehiscence</B> was an outcome in eleven studies, and events reported in ten studies.<BR/>The risk of dehiscence ranged from 0% (0/80) to 8,3% (3/36) in early feeding groups and from 0% (0/40) to 27% (4/15) in control groups. None of the nine included trials showed that early feeding led to a reduction in risk of anastomotic dehiscence with a combined relative risk of 0,69 (0,36 to 1,32), with heterogeneity between studies (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 5,75, P=0.85).</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality</B> was an outcome parametre in ten studies and were reported in six studies. The cause of mortality was often poorly reported and it may be inappropriate to prescribe the reduction in mortality seen to early feeding. When reported, mortality occurred predominantly in the hospital unit during the entire experimental period, except for in one study in which 30 day mortality was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>). Mortality reported ranged from none to 6,7% (2/30) in the early feeding groups, and from none to 19% (7/37) in the control groups. The combined relative risk was 0,41 (0,18 to 0,93), with very little heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0,60, P=0,99). However, the reported events of mortality are not necessarily associated with early commencement of feeding, as the vast majority of reported pathologies of included patients was of malignant origin. Most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, reoperation, and acute myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>
<B>Postsurgical pneumonia</B> was an outcome parametre in ten studies, and reported in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartsell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartsell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulrooney-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrooney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reissman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reissman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucha 2005</LINK>). Pneumonia events ranged from none to 6,3% (1/16) in the treatment group and from none to 7.1% (7/98) in the control group. Overall result was non-significant, with a relative risk of 0.76 (0.36 - 1.58) with little heterogeneity chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 3,96, P= 0,86), in the favour of early enteral nutrition.</P>
<P>
<B>Length of hospital stay </B>was reported in all of the fourteen studies.<BR/>We estimated standard deviations (SD) by dividing ranges by factor 4 for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Binderow-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Binderow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>), in which the standard deviations were not informed. In one study, <LINK REF="STD-Lucha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucha 2005</LINK>, it was not possible to calculate the SD, as the study did not report ranges but only mean values. The mean length of stay ranged from 6.2 days to 19.0 days in early feeding groups and from 6.8 days to 16.0 days in control groups. Results display a tendency towards shorter stay at the hospital unit for the treatment group, but the combined results showed some evidence of heterogeneity between studies (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 18,86, P=0.06).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects reported (vomitting, nausea, AMI):</B>
<BR/>There was a significant increase in the relative risk of vomiting among patients fed early (1,27, 1,01 to 1,61, P=0.04) with little heterogeneity chi2 = 4,21, P= 0,52). A total of six studies described vomitting, and the absolute risks ranged from 21% (17/80) to 50% (15/30) in the early feeding groups and from 14% (11/81) to 57% (17/30) in the control groups. Four of the studies reported oral feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Binderow-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Binderow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartsell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartsell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reissman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reissman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>), one study used nasoduodenal tube (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>) and one used jejunostomy tube (<LINK REF="STD-Heslin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heslin 1997</LINK>).<BR/>When nasogastric tubes were not placed routinely at the time of surgery the rate of placement because of nausea and vomiting was higher in patients fed early (data not presented).<BR/>A few primary trials reported other adverse events, such as acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>) and thrombosis (<LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1996</LINK>), but they were too infrequently reported making meaningful comment difficult.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Other parametres:</B>
<BR/>Cost effectiveness is difficult to examine, as there is limited data available. Therefore, this outcome is not summarised in this review. Likewise comment on the quality of life parametres, mainly due to a very short period of time for the treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias:<BR/>
</B>We examined publication bias (Funnel plots) for all outcomes, and have presented two, wound infection (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and anastomotic leakage (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Trial numbers were relatively small for both outcomes, and we observed symmetry in the funnel plot of precision by effect size for wound infection, whereas the opposite was the case for anastomotic leakage, the majority of trials reporting a benefit of early commencement of enteral feeding. Funnel plots did not reveal any significant publication bias for the included trials for any of the reported outcomes.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The key message of this systematic review is that there is no obvious benefit for keeping patients 'nil by mouth' after gastrointestinal surgery, and confirms the conclusion from a systematic review published in BMJ in 2001(<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>). The current review identified and included three more studies from the searches in the summary statistics (<LINK REF="STD-Lucha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulrooney-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrooney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smedley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smedley 2004</LINK>).<BR/>However, a lot of the data on clinical complications from theses three studies could not be extracted for use. The amount of feed received was generally not available, and will vary each day out from the operation. The presented analysis was on intention to treat. Unlike our previous review early enteral feeding was not associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay, but was associated with a reduction in mortality.<BR/>
<BR/>All the outcomes we assessed were clinically relevant in the context of gastrointestinal surgery. The reduction in mortality with early feeding is highly relevant although difficult to explain. In all six studies where mortality was reported, the direction effects was towards reduced mortality in early enterally fed patients. There were insufficient data to comment on the cause of death. Reduction of the mortality tended to be larger in the smaller studies, which may be due to chance, publication bias or a lower methodological quality of the smaller studies. Mortality was one out of nine outcome measures examined and no evidence of small study bias was evident for the other outcomes. It is likely that the association of decreased mortality was a chance finding.</P>
<P>Individual clinical complications such as anastomotic dehiscence failed to reach conventional levels of statistical significance but the direction of effect indicates that earlier feeding may reduce the risk of dehiscence. Unfortunately, it was impossible to comment on many factors which may have influenced the clinical complication endpoints such as the fitness of the patient, experience of the surgeon, whether resections were on the small or large bowel, the operation time, post operative pain analgesia, pain control, use of antibiotics and the success of the operation in removing the underlying pathology. Furthermore the definition of dehiscence varied between the trials and in many trials no explicit definitions were presented for other clinical complications such as pneumonia. A good example of where this may be in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Beier_x002d_Holgersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Beier-Holgersen 1996</LINK>, where wound infections occurred in a third of control subjects where as in other studies minimal infection rates were noted. This would suggest that their definition of wound infection used by was too sensitive to be clinically relevant.<BR/>
<BR/>Length of hospital stay was reduced in nine out of fourteen studies. Overall reduction corresponded to about a day, which is both clinically and economically important. Reduction in complication rates may explain this observation as might faster return of gastrointestinal function. Post-operative feeding after non-gastrointestinal surgery has also been shown to reduce postoperative inpatient stay.<BR/>The higher incidence of vomiting reported in the early feeding group did not relate to either orally or tube feeding. Furthermore the site of surgery, as five of the six studies reported lower GI predominantly. After an operation there is poor GI motility, thus if given feed and it is not emptied from stomach the patient will vomit. Lots of other factors effect vomiting: degree of surgical manipulation, opoid drugs given etc.<BR/>Few studies assessed the financial impact of early enteral feeding.</P>
<P>The 14 randomised trials identified were clinically heterogenous and most of them were small and of uncertain methodological quality. Combining trials that differ in terms of underlying condition, operation and intervention may be appropriate. However, we were interested in the pragmatic comparison of early verses deferred feeding strategies after gastrointestinal surgery, and not indifferences between feed types or specific routes of feeding. It is note worthy that the effect of early nutrition appears to be homogenous across a set of trials that were clearly heterogeneous in clinical terms. Our ability to detect heterogeneity between trials was however limited by the small number of trials by the often inadequate reporting.</P>
<P>Methods of randomisation and blinding of outcome assessments was also not described in sufficient detail, which means that the uncertainty regarding the methodological quality of trails remains. In particular the identical or closely similar number of patients in comparison groups of these trials must be of concern.</P>
<P>Surgical and anaesthetic practice has changed dramatically since publication of the first randomised controlled trial in 1979 (<LINK REF="STD-Sagar-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sagar 1979</LINK>). Surgery is less 'stressful' especially if done laparoscopically. Patients recover from anaesthetics faster and combined with improved postoperative analgesia enable patients to mobilise and recover much faster than previous. Thus patients today may be much more able to tolerate early enteral feeding than was seen in previous studies. It is also possible that the perceived benefits of early enteral feeding may not be so obvious.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-11 15:52:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no obvious advantage in keeping patients 'nil by mouth' following gastrointestinal surgery, and this review support the notion on early commencement. Specialy due to pronounced changes in surgical techniques (introduction to laparoscopic surgery) which is much less stressful to the patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review gives sufficient evidence for suggesting large powered clinical trial to show differences in endpoints and assess the positive benefits in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. As the nature of surgery has changed with fast track surgery (rapid-recovery) protocols, with patients being discharged after 3-5 days even after complex surgery , this means that examination of the effect of early nutrition alone in this context would be very difficult. This review has shown that keeping patients 'nil by mouth¹ is pointless. Next step will be to actively feed increased calories, as patients only take a small proportion of required energy in the first few days post operation.</P>
