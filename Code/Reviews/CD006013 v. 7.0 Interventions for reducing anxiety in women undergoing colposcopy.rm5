<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-11 15:28:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women can experience high levels of anxiety at all stages of screening for cervical cancer including colposcopy (visualisation of the cervix by using a binocular microscope). Colposcopy has been shown to be associated with high levels of anxiety, even higher than anxiety levels in women before surgery and similar to the anxiety levels in women following an abnormal screening test for fetal abnormalities. High levels of anxiety before and during colposcopy can have psychological consequences including pain, discomfort and failure to return for follow-up. This review examined interventions aimed at reducing such anxiety. Anxiety associated with colposcopic examination appears to be reduced by a variety of interventions including playing music during colposcopy, and viewing the procedure on a TV monitor (video colposcopy).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-10 11:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prior to the development of cervical cancer abnormal cervical cells can be detected on a cervical smear. The usual practice following an abnormal cervical smear is to perform colposcopy. Colposcopy is the visualisation of the cervix using a binocular microscope. Women experience high levels of anxiety and negative emotional responses at all stages of cervical screening. High levels of anxiety before and during colposcopy can have adverse consequences, including pain and discomfort during the procedure and high loss to follow-up rates. This review evaluates interventions designed to reduce anxiety levels during colposcopic examination.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy of various interventions aimed at reducing anxiety during colposcopic examination in women. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-03-21 14:24:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 3, 2010, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to July 2010. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-11 15:55:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Mean differences for anxiety levels, knowledge scores, pain, patient satisfaction and psychosexual dysfunction in women who underwent colposcopy were pooled in a random effects meta-analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-11 15:56:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found six trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials assessed the effectiveness of different interventions for reducing anxiety in women undergoing colposcopy for the first time.</P>
<P>All comparisons were restricted to single trial analyses or meta analysis of just two trials. There was evidence from a reasonably large trial (n = 220) that was at low risk of bias to suggest that music during colposcopy significantly reduced anxiety levels (MD = -4.80, 95% CI: -7.86 to -1.74) and pain experienced during the procedure (MD = -1.71, 95% CI: -2.37 to -1.05) compared to not listening to music. There was no statistically significant difference between anxiety levels prior to colposcopy in women receiving information leaflets versus no leaflets and information leaflets, video and counselling versus information leaflets and video with no counselling. However, knowledge scores were significantly higher and psychosexual dysfunction scores were significantly lower in women who received leaflets compared to those who did not so there was some sort of benefit to giving patients information leaflets. There is evidence for video colposcopy from a quasi randomised trial which assessed 81 women showing significant anxiety reduction.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-03 10:59:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anxiety appears to be reduced by playing music during colposcopy. Although information leaflets did not reduce anxiety levels, they did increase knowledge levels and are therefore useful in obtaining clinical consent to the colposcopic procedure. Leaflets also contributed to improved patient quality of life by reducing psychosexual dysfunction.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-10 11:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-14 17:47:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the cervix. The development of cancer of the cervix is a multi step process and can take many years. Before it does, cervical cells undergo changes and become abnormal. These abnormalities are not cancerous and are called cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). They are, however, associated with an increased risk of subsequent invasive cancer of the cervix. It is widely accepted that infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is associated with the development of CIN and cancer. However, not all women with HPV infection, will develop cervical cancer. Regular cervical smears aim to detect abnormal cells in the cervix and once they are detected treatment can be given and cancer can be prevented.</P>
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.69% in developed countries to 1.38% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>). The incidence of death from cervical cancer has fallen in England and Wales with the death rate now roughly 50% of what it was in 1988 (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>). This fall was a direct result of the NHS cervical screening programme (<LINK REF="REF-Luesley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luesley 2004</LINK>). In the UK, where a high level of compliance with the programme has been achieved, screening may have prevented as many as 6000 deaths in the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Sasieni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasieni 2000</LINK>). More recently it has been estimated that up to 5000 deaths per year are likely to be prevented by screening (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-09 15:10:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following an abnormal cervical smear, colposcopy is performed to aid the identification of the transformation zone where cervical neoplasia originates (<LINK REF="REF-Coppleson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coppleson 1968</LINK>). Colposcopy is the visualization of the cervix using a stereoscopic binocular microscope of low magnification (10x to 40x) (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monaghan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monaghan 1994</LINK>). Colposcopy facilitates the performance of a diagnostic biopsy or treatment in the form of Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ) (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2004</LINK>). It is an integral part of the cervical screening programme that aims to prevent cancer in women by detecting precursor lesions which if left untreated could lead to the development of cancer.</P>
<P>Women with an abnormal smear who are referred for colposcopy undergo high levels of stress and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 1990</LINK>). Apart from the fear of having cancer, other concerns and anxieties stem from the uncertainty about what is going to happen and what the colposcopic procedure entails (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anxiety is defined as a non-specific, unpleasant feeling of apprehension, discomfort, and, in some cases, dread and impending doom. It is an uncomfortable emotional state associated with a perceived danger, feelings of powerlessness and prolonged tension in preparation for the expected danger/event. Since high levels of anxiety before colposcopy can have adverse consequences, including pain and discomfort during the procedure and high rate of default (failure to attend the procedure), various interventions have been used to reduce anxiety during colposcopic examination. In patients undergoing surgery studies on the role of information, training in coping strategies and emotional support have been shown to have a positive effect and improved post-operative recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Contrada-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Contrada 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>). A variety of interventions have been tried in women undergoing colposcopy to reduce their level of anxiety. They include information booklets, leaflets, video colposcopy and educational counselling.</P>

<P>All included trials were randomised and a parallel group design was used, all investigated interventions to reduce anxiety in women having abnormal smear results requiring colposcopic examination.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 1102 women with cervical abnormalities needing referral to the colposcopy clinic were randomised, of which 886 were assessed. Five trials specified that the women attended colposcopy for the first time, (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>), whereas the other study implied that the women were attending colposcopy for the first time (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman_x002d_Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman-Wang 2001</LINK>). One trial excluded pregnant women and women with severe dyskaryosis (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>), two trials excluded pregnant women and women with mental impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>) and one study excluded women needing a hysterectomy as well as women with severe dyskaryosis (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>At baseline, the intervention and control groups were similar regarding the prognostic factors in all of the seven trials. Women undergoing colposcopic examination were balanced across the arms of the studies in terms of their demographic data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The following outcome measures were reported in the trials:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Anxiety levels were assessed in all seven trials, where all the trials used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).</LI>
<LI>None of the trials examined the effect of colposcopic examination on the QoL of the women.</LI>
<LI>Patient satisfaction was assessed in none of the trials</LI>
<LI>Pain experienced during the procedure was assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>). The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> used a visual analogue scale (VAS).</LI>
<LI>Psychosexual morbidity was assessed using psychosexual questionnaire in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Women's knowledge about the colposcopic procedure was assessed in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>). These trials did not use standard validated knowledge questionnaires.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Anxiety</HEADING>
<P>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for adults was used in all of the trials to assess women's anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK>). This consists of 40 self reported items that measure state and trait anxiety score range from 20 to 80, with the lower scores indicating lower anxiety levels. This is a validated reliable and sensitive measure of anxiety, that has been widely used to assess anxiety in adult populations, (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 1992</LINK>). The fact that all of the studies used the same outcome measure for anxiety makes the meta-analysis simpler.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of Life</HEADING>
<P>Despite there being a large number of outcome measures to assess QoL that are sensitive and reliable in adults e.g. SF-36 (<LINK REF="REF-Brazier-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazier 1992</LINK>), none were used in any of the included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>) assessed whether the patient's knowledge of the procedure had been improved by their interventions. Each study generated their own questionnaire, the details of which were mostly unclear, so comparison between these results is difficult as different aspects of knowledge may well have been assessed by each questionnaire. For example, one of the excluded trials (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2004</LINK>) assessed knowledge by asking the participants "What is your understanding of abnormal smear result?" There were three possible responses, "cancer", "pre-cancer", "don't know". Obviously this does not assess the patient's knowledge of the colposcopic procedure just the reason for it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain</HEADING>
<P>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> assessed the patient's levels of pain experienced during the colposcopic procedure. This trial used a patient completed visual analogue scale (VAS). The results of a VAS can be significantly influenced by the phrases (the anchor statements) that are used at each end of the line, e.g. no pain versus worst pain, these were the anchor phrases used by <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>. From a practical perspective, the VAS is an easy to use patient centred measure of pain intensity. It is internally consistent with respect to the patient themselves, but a VAS may not be a valid tool to use within large scale clinical trials. In addition, the VAS is subject to measurement errors by the investigator, it is associated with additional administrative burdens due to the need to explain the VAS to the patient (i.e. to ensure that he/she understands that the VAS is meant to represent a continuum of pain), the need to measure the patient's rating and the need for quality assurance resources to verify that the measurement is accurate (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials measured patient satisfaction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Psychosexual scores</HEADING>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK> assessed the psychosexual outcomes for the participants in their study. They used Campion's questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Campion-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campion 1988</LINK>), whilst not validated this as an outcome measure this questionnaire has been used in other similar patient populations and proven to be sensitive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials reported any adverse events associated with their intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention i.e. reduction of anxiety for a single clinical event (colposcopy) long term effects were not required of the interventions. However a reduction in anxiety during the colposcopic procedure may have increased the chances of the patients re-attending for further clinical follow-up appointments. The duration of clinical follow up ranged between four weeks and one year in the trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample size described in each group</HEADING>
<P>Sample size and power calculations were performed in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>). All of the trials described the number of women in the intervention and control group. Patient numbers were small generally ranging from 13 to 50 in each arm for most of the studies, but three studies had significantly larger groups of participants. There were 112 in the intervention arm and 108 in the control arm in the two trials by Chan et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>). The trials were conducted one year apart in the same institution, and we have checked with the authors that indeed the two trials were on two completely different group of Chinese women undergoing colposcopic examination. There were 107 in the intervention arm and 103 in the control arm in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ITT analysis</HEADING>
<P>ITT analysis of the results was performed in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>). This could have introduced bias into the remaining study's analyses. All of the studies included did compare their data statistically between the groups for at least the primary outcome measure (anxiety).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ethics</HEADING>
<P>Investigators in a trial should adhere to The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Detailed information about the proposed trial either verbal or written are required, and the requirements have been getting tighter over the years. Currently in the UK a written information leaflet is provided to research participants which details the purpose of the trial, the intervention proposed, trial procedures etc. After patients have read and understood the information provided they must then provide written consent to participate in the research project. However it is recognised that different ethical standards and procedures existed in previous times and exist currently in different countries.</P>
<P>Of the six trials reviewed, the principles of research consent were followed in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>). Most of the trials have given either written information to their participant or stated that they had provided verbal information. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>, no information either verbal or written was given to the control groups.</P>

This resulted in adequate concealment of the allocation. The method of randomisation and allocation concealment was not reported in the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman_x002d_Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman-Wang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the trials blinded the patients. These are trials assessing anxiety reduction interventions in women having colposcopic examination. The women would have been aware whether they had received the intervention or not, therefore they could not have been blinded. The relevant outcomes in this review are subjective and thus best rated by the patient's themselves. It is acknowledged that this could have introduced bias, but it is unavoidable because of the nature of the interventions and the outcomes. It may have been possible to blind care providers or outcome assessors but this was not reported in any of the trials examined. This could have introduced bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Information leaflets versus no information leaflets</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>) assessing 373 participants who had been randomised to either information leaflets prior to their colposcopic examination or to no information leaflets. The smallest trial of <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK> (n=15 in the treatment group versus n=13 in the control group) showed a significant reduction in the anxiety levels in women receiving specifically designed information leaflets (MD = -8.70, 95% CI: -14.61 to -2.79). The larger <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK> trial showed no significant reduction in anxiety (MD = 1.54, 95% CI: -1.71 to 4.79). Meta-analysis of these two trials found no significant difference in anxiety levels between women receiving information leaflets and those not receiving leaflets (MD = -3.27, 95% CI: -13.29 to 6.75). The percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) may represent considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%). The heterogeneity found was likely to reflect differences in the size and character of the patient populations examined, possible differences in the contents of the information leaflets, as well as differences in the methodological quality of the different trials.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Freeman_x002d_Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman-Wang 2001</LINK> trial compared 48 women receiving an information leaflet in combination with information video and 45 women receiving information leaflets only. They assessed if the information video in combination with the information leaflet would lead to reduction in anxiety levels in comparison to information leaflets only.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-21 16:13:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Colposcopy has been associated with high levels of anxiety, even higher than anxiety levels in women before surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marteau-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 1990</LINK>), and similar to the anxiety levels in women following an abnormal serum screening for fetal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 1988</LINK>). High levels of anxiety before and during colposcopy can have adverse psychological consequences, including impairment of mood, daily activities, sleep and sexual interest in women with abnormal smears compared with controls (<LINK REF="REF-Lerman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 1991</LINK>). The high levels of anxiety could result in an increase in pain and discomfort experienced during the procedure and also high rate of loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Lerman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 1991</LINK>). The high anxiety levels and psychological stress may also result in a decreased ability to recall and act on advice, which can make women less likely to comply with the information they are given (<LINK REF="REF-Sorg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorg 1992</LINK>). This review has evaluated the possible effectiveness of different interventions used to reduce the levels of anxiety experienced by women undergoing colposcopic examination. We found evidence that playing music during colposcopy reduces anxiety levels and pain experienced during the procedure compared to not listening to music. We also found that watching an information video in addition to receiving an information leaflet reduces anxiety levels compared to receiving leaflets only. There was no statistically significant difference between anxiety levels prior to colposcopy in women receiving information leaflets versus no leaflets and information leaflets, video and counselling versus information leaflets and video with no counselling. However, knowledge scores were significantly higher and psychosexual dysfunction scores were significantly lower in women who received leaflets compared to those who did not so there was some sort of benefit to giving patients information leaflets.</P>

</UL>
<P>The validity of a systematic review is influenced by the validity of its component studies. This review is limited in its ability to reach meaningful conclusion on the effectiveness of some interventions because some trials suffered from small numbers, poor methodological quality and in most cases moderate or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This review has determined that there is evidence to suggest that an effective method of reducing anxiety and pain during colposcopy is to play music. This is a very simple and cheap intervention, the clinic could ask patients to bring along their own music, and if needed their own music media players (CD or MP3 player).</P>
<P>Information sheets have a number of aims, anxiety reduction being only one of them. Patients need to be fully informed before they give consent to clinical procedures so that they understand the benefits and any potential risks associated with them. Providing written material allows the patients to digest the information at their own pace and therefore be more likely to comprehend and retain the information required. Overall this review suggests that written information sheets do not reduce anxiety levels, although they may reduce psychosexual dysfunction and improve knowledge scores.</P>
<P>A number of the trials in this review examined whether providing information in a number of formats e.g. with leaflets and video, or with additional support e.g. with counselling is most effective. However all of these trials were relatively small and methodologically flawed and so no definitive answer can be derived from the evidence presented. Logically it can be suggested that information provided in more than one format e.g. with video and information leaflets, may be more easily understood. However the addition of a counsellor has the potential to be very costly and at present the evidence does not support the use of counsellors, although more evidence is probably needed.</P>
<P>Colposcopy is associated with high levels of anxiety, therefore anxiety reduction is an important aspect of providing good care for women having colposcopic examination. High levels of anxiety are associated with psychological morbidity and can lead to higher rates of loss to follow up. This review has shown in one adequately powered trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>) that the simple intervention of playing music during the colposcopic procedure reduces anxiety and pain.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-03 11:03:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the methodological quality of the trials and the standard of the reporting was poor. All six trials were published after the CONSORT guidelines were published (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), when trial methodology and reporting was more formalised, so this finding is disappointing.</P>
<P>Of the six trials included in this review only four trials used adequate methods of randomisation and concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Byrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Byrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>), whereas the remaining trials did not report their methods (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman_x002d_Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman-Wang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>). We excluded quasi-randomised trials as they had the potential to introduce significant selection bias into the study (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient numbers ranged from very small (n = 13) in each arm to adequate (n = 112), although the numbers of participants in most trials was small. There were 220 participants in both Chan trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>) and 210 in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK> which was deemed adequate, but generally the number of patients in each of the trials was not satisfactory, especially as many of the comparisons were based on single trial analyses.</P>
<P>All of the trials measured anxiety using the STAI. Despite the association between pain and anxiety only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>) measured pain. None of the included trials assessed QoL, and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>) measured psychosexual scores. Three trials measured knowledge and no trial measured patient satisfaction, except for some of the excluded quasi-RCTs.</P>
<P>Six RCTs assessing 886 participants were found that compared the efficacy of various interventions aimed at reducing anxiety versus no interventions or that compared the efficacy of one style of anxiety-reducing intervention versus a second style of anxiety-reducing intervention in women undergoing colposcopy. These trials varied significantly in the quality of their methodology and their risk of bias.</P>
<P>The methods used to reduce anxiety prior to and during colposcopy in these trials varied considerably. There does not appear to be a consensus in the field as to what method to reduce anxiety is most appropriate to treat women undergoing colposcopy.</P>
<P>The use of information leaflets compared to no information leaflets appears to not reduce anxiety levels in women undergoing colposcopy. However it does appear that this intervention reduces psychosexual dysfunction and increases women's knowledge scores.</P>
<P>Listening to music during colposcopy compared to no music showed a significant reduction in the levels of anxiety and pain experienced.</P>
<P>The addition of a counselling component to an intervention that already included information leaflets and a video demonstrated no significant effect on anxiety levels nor improvement in the knowledge scores.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-10-10 11:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature and all studies were sifted and data extracted by three review authors independently. In the update of the review we restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as we found only three included trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-03 11:14:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Quasi RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK> adopted a parallel group design. Women with an even hospital number were assigned to pre-colposcopy counselling (intervention group) and women with an odd hospital number assigned to no counselling (control group). In this trial, 59 women aged between 16 and 49 years with abnormal smears attending colposcopy for the first time were included in a hospital outpatient refuelling questionnaire setting. STAI questionnaire and standardised anxiety and depression scales were measured before the intervention and after colposcopy. This study did not show a statistically significant reduction in anxiety levels in those that received counselling. This study had very small numbers in the intervention (n = 29) and control groups (n = 30). Counselling was not examined in any of the included trials in the review.</P>
<P>The authors of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Danhauer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Danhauer 2007</LINK>) hypothesised that music or guided imagery versus usual care would result in less anxiety and perceived pain for colposcopy patients. 170 colposcopy patients were randomised to music, guided imagery, or usual care after completing a baseline questionnaire. All patients completed a post-procedure questionnaire. Study participants had a mean age of 28.4 years (SD = 9.6; range 18 to 60) and formed a racially diverse group. Education and income levels were low. No between-group differences were found for post-procedure anxiety or pain rating. The trial was at moderate risk of bias. Study participants were randomised using simple randomisation with an equal probability to 1 of the 3 study groups; this was operationalised by having each participant select a random assignment slip. A research assistant was responsible for assembling study forms/materials and data entry, but it was unclear as to whether they were blinded. Mind-body interventions had no statistically significant impact on reported anxiety, perceived pain, or satisfaction with care, even for those who anticipated the most pain or started with high anxiety.</P>
<P>The Quasi RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2004</LINK> used parallel group design. Every second patient was assigned to intervention group. 81 women aged between 20 and 40 years of age, with abnormal smears attending colposcopy for the first time were included in the trial. The 81 women were divided into two sub-groups, 43 in a laser colposcopy group and 38 in a colposcopy review (normal re-check) group. The intervention was a video colposcopy where the participant was able to observe a monitor presenting real time images of the cervix during procedure. Anxiety was assessed using STAI, knowledge assessed using semi-structured interview and pain was assessed by asking the women how severe was the pain before and after interventions. Anxiety levels were checked after video colposcopy in both groups. In the colposcopy review group there was 20 women in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The trial assessed the effect of viewing the colposcopy through video (video colposcopy) on the levels of anxiety in women. It showed that video colposcopy was associated with reduction in anxiety levels (MD = -10.08,95% CI -15.40 to -4.76; P &lt; 0.001). In the laser group there were 22 participants in the intervention group and 21 in the control group. The mean anxiety level was significantly reduced in the video group compared to the group that did not see the video (MD = -8.43, 95% CI: -12.24 to -4.62 P &lt; 0.01). <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2004</LINK> also assessed pain experienced by women undergoing colposcopic examination as a secondary outcome. The mean pain score in the video group was significantly lower than in the group that did not see the video (MD = -1.02,95% CI -1.47 to -0.57, P&lt;0.01). Pain during the colposcopic procedure was not assessed in any of the included studies examining other interventions. The trial also assessed patient satisfaction of their experience of treatment in the colposcopy clinic. They did not show any significant difference between the two groups. This study used a poor method of randomisation and concealment of allocation, therefore overall there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of video colposcopy to reduce anxiety in women undergoing colposcopy.</P>
<P>The quasi-RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Tomaino_x002d_Brunner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tomaino-Brunner 1998 </LINK>used a parallel group design. Randomisation was based on the week of scheduled appointment so concealment of allocation was not possible. The trial included 103 women attending colposcopy for the first time. Information leaflets were given to women in the intervention group one week before colposcopy. The control group did not receive an information leaflet. patients completed STAI and knowledge questionnaires before and after the intervention. Drop-out rates were similar in the intervention and control groups. We identified three studies that examined this type of intervention. The smallest study which was included in this review (n = 28) (<LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1996</LINK>) showed significant reductions in anxiety levels, they also showed that using a simple information booklet is associated with reduced anxiety. This may suggest that the content of the information leaflets/ booklet is important in anxiety reduction. In addition two larger studies (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1999</LINK>
<B>; </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Tomaino_x002d_Brunner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tomaino-Brunner 1998</LINK>) did not show statistically significant reductions in anxiety levels. Given the methodological flaws of these studies and the small number of patients examined, we are unable to support or refute that information leaflets reduce anxiety levels.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Greimel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Greimel 1997</LINK> was a quasi-RCT trial which randomised according to date of birth of the patients. 147 women with cervical abnormalities attending colposcopy clinic for the first time were included. Women with previous diagnosis of smear abnormalities and women who have had hysterectomy were excluded. The trial included three intervention groups which compared information given verbally without teaching aids, information given verbally and in graph form and verbal information with information video of colposcopy. There was also a control group where women were given information only on request. Anxiety was measured using STAI, patient satisfaction was assessed using the Likert scale and knowledge was assessed with semi-structured interviews. Outcomes were measured just prior to the intervention and immediately after the colposcopy. The trial compared 35 women having verbal information, information using visual aids and video information versus 35 women in the control group which were given information only when they sought it. The mean reduction in the level of anxiety was not significant. . The trial assessed the knowledge in the women in the intervention group (counselling) compared to the control group. There was significantly lower knowledge scores in the control group compared to the intervention group. The knowledge score in the intervention group was 10.6 and 8.50 in the control group (MD = 2.1, 95% CI: 0.92 to 3.28, P &lt; 0.01). Knowledge scores were not assessed in any of the other studies examining other interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Greimel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Greimel 1997</LINK> also assessed patient satisfaction. In their study satisfaction scores were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD = 14.10, 95% CI 10.50 to 17.70, P &lt; 0.01).</P>

<LI>The methods used to reduce anxiety prior to and during colposcopy used in these trials varied considerably. There does not appear to be a consensus in the field as to what method to reduce anxiety is most appropriate to treat women undergoing colposcopy.
