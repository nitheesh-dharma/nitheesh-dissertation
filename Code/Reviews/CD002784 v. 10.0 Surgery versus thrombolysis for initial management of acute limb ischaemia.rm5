<TITLE>Surgery versus thrombolysis for initial management of acute limb ischaemia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-23 08:32:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>Thrombolysis involves dissolving a blood clot by injecting an enzyme into the blood clot. It is used as an alternative to surgery for managing severely reduced blood flow (acute ischaemia) in the leg. A blood clot (thrombosis) forms in a leg blood vessel where there is severe narrowing (stenosis) in a natural artery or a bypass graft.</P>
<P>The review authors identified five controlled trials with a total of 1283 participants who were randomly allocated to receive initial peripheral arterial thrombolysis or surgery for the immediate management of acute limb ischaemia. There was no evidence in favour of either initial thrombolysis or initial surgery as the preferred option in terms of preventing the need for major amputation (limb salvage) or death within one year. More major complications occurred within 30 days of the procedure with thrombolysis, including stroke and major bleeding (haemorrhage). A total of 1.3% of patients receiving thrombolysis had a stroke compared to none in surgery patients; 8.8% had a major haemorrhage after thrombolysis compared to 3.3% in surgery patients. People receiving initial thrombolysis underwent a less severe degree of intervention but may have a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia. These higher risks of complications with thrombolysis have to be weighted against individual risks in surgery. Either recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase were the agents used for thrombolysis.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:11:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>Five trials with a total of 1283 participants were included. There was no significant difference in limb salvage or death at 30 days, six months or one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. However, stroke was significantly more frequent at 30 days in thrombolysis participants (1.3%) compared to surgery participants (0%) (Odds ratio (OR) 6.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 26.22). Major haemorrhage was more likely at 30 days in thrombolysis participants (8.8%) compared to surgery participants (3.3%) (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.60); and distal embolization was more likely at 30 days in thrombolysis participants (12.4%) compared to surgery participants (0%) (OR 8.35; 95% CI 4.47 to 15.58).</P>
<P>Participants treated by initial thrombolysis underwent a less severe degree of intervention (OR 5.37; 95% CI 3.99 to 7.22) and displayed equivalent overall survival compared to initial surgery (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Universal initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated on the available evidence. There is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. Thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications including stroke. The higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each person.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-11 11:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>Peripheral arterial thrombolysis is a useful technique in the management of peripheral arterial ischaemia. Much is known about the indications, risks and benefits of thrombolysis, although data from randomised controlled studies are limited. The management of the acutely ischaemic leg has traditionally been the domain of the surgeon and, with increasing specialisation, the vascular surgeon. The optimal initial management of the acutely ischaemic leg needs to be determined.</P>
<P>In 1963, introduction of the thromboembolectomy catheter (a flexible tube through which thrombus is extracted) allowed large amounts of thromboembolic material to be removed rapidly to restore blood flow to ischaemic areas. However, the nature of the underlying disease process has changed since then. Whilst emboli used to be the most likely cause of a sudden deterioration in limb perfusion, this is now more likely to be caused by thrombosis at a site of underlying severe stenosis (narrowing of the vessel). The use of a thromboembolectomy catheter under these circumstances is more likely to exacerbate, rather than relieve, the situation. Furthermore, acute thrombosis of peripheral arterial bypass grafts is also an important cause of acute ischaemia and the sensitive endothelial lining of vein grafts may be easily denuded (stripped off) by a thromboembolectomy catheter. In addition, up to 30% of thromboembolectomies may show residual thrombus on angiogram (<LINK REF="REF-Plecha-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plecha 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>Peripheral arterial thrombolysis, involving the localised infusion of an enzyme to dissolve the clot, potentially allows the preservation of endothelium, the accurate localisation of any underlying aetiological factor causing thrombosis, and its correction either percutaneously (through the skin), or by a more limited directed surgical approach. However, this may be at the risk of a greater incidence of major haemorrhage and stroke. Direct comparison between initial thrombolysis and initial surgery has now been addressed by a number of randomised trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-11 13:03:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>To determine whether thrombolysis or surgery is the more effective technique in the initial management of acute limb ischaemia. The specific hypotheses to be tested were:</P>
<P>1) there are advantages in terms of limb salvage and survival dependent upon whether thrombolysis or surgery is used in the initial management of acute limb ischaemia; and <BR/>2) there is a reduction in the eventual level of intervention required dependent upon whether thrombolysis or surgery is used in the initial management of acute limb ischaemia.</P>

<P>The Nilsson trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1992</LINK>) was awarded a B grade for methodological quality, but all the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>), and additional papers from those trials (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>) were awarded A grades.</P>
<P>All studies were randomised using telephone computerised randomisation with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1992</LINK> (not actually stated). Due to the nature of the study, neither participants nor observers were blinded.</P>
<P>All studies were reported as intention-to-treat (ITT). The STILE trial (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>) also reported as per-protocol. Intention-to-treat includes analysis of all participants according to the treatment allocated by the randomisation procedure, regardless of whether they actually received that particular treatment. Per-protocol analysis was performed on the two groups of participants that actually received the two different treatments.</P>
<P>Duration of ischaemia requiring intervention was less than 14 days in <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1998a</LINK>. However, <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1994</LINK> used less than seven days of ischaemia as criteria for intervention. The STILE trial (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>), admitted participants with "signs or symptoms of worsening limb ischaemia within the past six months who required intervention" or who had a bypass graft occlusion.</P>

<P>The concept of a reduced level of procedure required was used in the STILE and Ouriel trials. This consists of a list of interventional procedures in order of increasing severity of intervention. Hence, if thrombolytic treatment were successful, it could be argued that the reduced need for further intervention would be less hazardous to the participant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1992</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, a total of 20 participants were randomised to thrombolysis (n = 11) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) infused over a three hour period, or to surgical thrombectomy (n = 9). There were no strokes or major haemorrhages with either thrombolysis or surgery at 30 days. Furthermore, there were no deaths or amputations in the thrombolytic group at 30 days, though there was one death and one amputation in the surgery group. Only four participants had successful thrombolysis with continued patency at one month. Three participants required a femoro-distal graft and two required thromboembolectomy. However, such small numbers hinder any firm conclusions from being drawn from this study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1994</LINK>
<BR/>In this trial, 114 participants were randomised to surgery (revascularisation or amputation, as required; n = 57) or to thrombolysis with urokinase (n = 57). At the 12 month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1994</LINK>) there was a significant survival advantage of initial thrombolysis (84%) compared to initial surgery (58%; P = 0.01) (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.28; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63). This was thought to be due principally to the difference in in-hospital cardio-pulmonary complications between the two groups (thrombolysis group 16%; surgery group 41%; P = 0.001). There was no difference in limb salvage. At 30 days the stroke rate was 1.8% (n = 1) and major haemorrhage rate was 10.5% (n = 6) in the thrombolysis group, compared to no strokes (n = 0) and a rate of major haemorrhage of 1.8% (n = 1) in the surgical group. Thirty-six percent of participants in the thrombolytic therapy group had continued patency at 12 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>
<BR/>The STILE trial (<LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>) recruited 393 participants from 31 centres (follow up information was available for 392 participants) to compare surgery against thrombolysis in the initial treatment of limb ischaemia. It should be noted that two different thrombolytic regimes were used (<I>see</I> the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). The trial included participants with a duration of ischaemia of up to six months. It was originally anticipated that interim analyses would be performed at 300 and 600 participants. However, the data monitoring committee stopped the trial at 393 participants due to a higher incidence of adverse events (Composite Clinical Outcome P = 0.011) in the thrombolytic group at one month. This was similar in both native artery and bypass graft subgroups at one month.</P>
<P>Composite Clinical Outcome was a combination of outcomes including: ongoing or recurrent ischaemia, death or major amputation (above or below-knee), life-threatening haemorrhage (hypotension, requiring resuscitation), or stroke, peri-intervention complications such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, renal failure requiring dialysis, serious anaesthetic complications, vascular complications and post-operative wound complications.</P>
<P>There was a significantly reduced level of the procedure required in the thrombolysis group compared to the surgical group (55.8% versus 5.5%; P = 0.001). At six months, those in the thrombolysis group with less than 14 days ischaemia had a significantly reduced rate of death or amputation, or both (15.3% versus 37.5%; P = 0.01) (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.72). For those with more than 14 days duration, a reversed trend was seen (death/amputation rate 9.9% in the surgical group versus 17.8% in the thrombolysis group), a difference which failed to reach significance (P = 0.08). Stroke occurred in 1.2% of participants receiving thrombolysis, while major haemorrhage occurred in 5.6%. In the surgical group haemorrhage occurred in 0.7%. Catheter placement failed in 28% of participants randomised to receive thrombolysis - a high technical failure rate, which potentially limits its widespread application. However, the study group may be unrepresentative.</P>
<P>Subsequent subgroup analysis by the trialists of those participants less than 14 days and those more than 14 days duration of ischaemia suggested alternative interpretations, although there had been no initial stratification in the randomisation protocol to allow for this. Participants with more than 14 days duration of history fared better (Composite Clinical Outcome) with surgery than with initial thrombolysis (P &lt; 0.001). For participants with less than 14 days duration of ischaemia there was no difference in overall Composite Clinical Outcome (P = 0.439), but there were more amputations in the surgical group (17.9% versus 5.7%; P = 0.061).</P>
<P>The 12 month follow-up data on bypass grafts were reported by Comerota (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>), and the native artery results by Weaver (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>
<BR/>Further subgroup analysis resulted in low numbers of participants in each sub-group. For example, analysis by duration of history less than 14 days reduced numbers to 35 in the thrombolysis group and 23 in the surgical group. A similar advantage of a reduced amputation rate demonstrated in the original STILE study was again seen in the less than 14 day thrombolysis group. Overall however, thrombolysis was associated with a higher level of continued ischaemia, claudication or critical limb ischaemia (73% versus 50%; P = 0.01) (OR 2.72; 95% CI 1.2 to 5.80). Those participants with ischaemia for more than 14 days were associated with a significantly increased risk of ongoing or recurrent ischaemia. Significantly increased morbidity was encountered with prosthetic grafts compared to autogenous grafts (P = 0.038). While no difference was found between supra-inguinal and infra-inguinal grafts, it should be noted that there were only 22 (38%) grafts in the supra-inguinal group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>
<BR/>The native artery 12 month results confirmed a reduction in the surgical procedure required in approximately 50% of those participants randomised to thrombolysis (i.e. 50% of those participants receiving thrombolysis were able to undergo a more limited procedure than would have been expected prior to thrombolysis). However, at one year both recurrent ischaemia and major amputation were significantly higher in the thrombolysis group (recurrent ischaemia 64% versus 35%; P &lt; 0.0001) (OR 3.26; 95% CI 1.92 to 5.52), major amputation 10% versus 0% (P = 0.0024). Stratification looking at ilio-femoral/femoro-popliteal and less than 14 days or more than 14 days duration of history all served to reduce the numbers in each group to as low as n = 4 in one instance.</P>
<P>The STILE trial papers (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>) all reported ITT but also per protocol analyses. There was a high percentage of participants classified as 'thrombolysis', who never actually received thrombolysis, after failure to site the catheter.</P>
<P>One of the major criticisms of the STILE publications was that the less than 14 days or more than 14 days analysis was a post-hoc arbitrary division, not a stratified part of the original protocol. Over 80% of all participants had a more than 14 days duration of history.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK>
<BR/>This paper (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK>) reports the early experience of the TOPAS group (The Study of <B>T</B>hrombolysis <B>O</B>r <B>P</B>eripheral <B>A</B>rterial <B>S</B>urgery). Seventy-nine participating centres enrolled 213 participants over approximately six months. Participants had Class II ischaemia for less than 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Reporting-Standards" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reporting Standards</LINK>). Three different urokinase thrombolysis regimes were used - 2000 IU/min, 4000 IU/min or 6000 IU/min for the first two hours, after which all groups received 2000 IU/min. The comparison between surgery and thrombolysis was performed with the optimal thrombolysis group (i.e. 4000 IU/min). No overall thrombolysis figures were available. There was no significant difference in the one year mortality rate or amputation-free survival rate between thrombolysis with 4000 IU/min urokinase and the surgical group. All thrombolytic groups had a significant reduction in open surgery compared to the surgery group at 30 days (P = 0.01).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1998a</LINK>
<BR/>In this subsequent trial, the 'optimal dose' of urokinase was used (4000 IU/min) as described for <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK> above. Five hundred and forty-eight participants from 113 centres throughout the USA and Northern Europe were recruited over a period of 17 months. Although the randomisation was done by telephone, there were significant differences between the treatment groups. There were significantly higher numbers of men, increased hepatic or renal insufficiency, or both, and increased rest pain at presentation in the thrombolysis group. Death at one year was similar between the two groups (thrombolysis = 20%; surgery = 17%) and there was no significant difference in limb salvage (thrombolysis = 65%; surgery = 69.9%). At 30 days four (1.6%) strokes had occurred in the thrombolytic group, but none in the surgery group. Major haemorrhage was significantly higher in the thrombolysis group at 30 days (12.5% versus 5.5%; P = 0.005) (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.28 to 4.29). Open surgical procedures were significantly lower in the thrombolysis group compared to the surgical group at six months (54% versus 91% respectively; P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 1998b</LINK>
<BR/>Using the TOPAS database, the authors found in a univariate analysis that amputation-free survival was associated with race (69.4% white versus 60.0% non-white); age (75.1% less than 65 years versus 60.2% greater than 65 years); body weight (60.5% less than 160 lb versus 73.5% greater than 160 lb); history of central nervous system disease (70.6% history versus 51.15 with no history); history of congestive heart failure (70.7% history versus 46.1% with no history); mottled or cyanotic skin (72.7% mottled or cyanotic versus 58.3% normal) and presence of rest pain (80.1% rest pain versus 62.9% no rest pain). All these were significant at the 5% level.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Meta-analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>Meta-analysis of the included trials showed no significant difference in limb salvage or death at 30 days, six months or one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. Stroke was significantly more likely to occur with initial thrombolysis at 30 days. There were eight strokes in the 640 participants receiving thrombolysis, compared to none in the 540 participants receiving initial surgery (OR 6.41; 95% CI 1.57 to 26.22). Major haemorrhage at 30 days was also more likely within the thrombolysis group, with 52/588 occurrences versus 16/482 occurrences in the surgery group (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.60). Distal embolization occurred in 42/340 participants receiving thrombolysis, with no reported occurrences in 338 participants undergoing initial surgery (OR 8.35; 95% CI 4.47 to 15.58).</P>
<P>As mentioned above concerning the STILE and Ouriel trials participants treated by initial thrombolysis may undergo a less severe degree of intervention (OR 5.37; 95% CI 3.99 to 7.22), and can expect an equivalent overall survival compared to initial surgery (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25). However, they may have a higher incidence of recurrent or ongoing limb ischaemia, major haemorrhage or stroke.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-11 11:59:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>There are relatively few trials available to resolve the use of surgery or thrombolysis in the initial treatment of acute limb ischaemia. Clinical heterogeneity, differing reporting methods, and differing thrombolytic agents or techniques all combine to inhibit very close comparison from one trial to another. However, meta-analysis of these trials does show a higher incidence of stroke, major haemorrhage and distal embolization at 30 days in the thrombolysis group. There was no significant difference in limb salvage or death at 30 days, six months, or one year. Improved survival at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1994</LINK>), was not confirmed in a much larger subsequent study (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1998a</LINK>); however, there were important differences in the study population. Subsequent further analysis of the TOPAS data (<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 1998b</LINK>) suggests a number of variables that might be used in the future selection of those participants most likely to benefit from initial thrombolysis.</P>
<P>Failure to place the catheter was a major problem in the STILE trial (<LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>), but this may reflect reality when such a technique is used more universally and when it is applied to more chronic lesions. However, while this may have affected the conclusions from the 'intention-to-treat' analysis, these were not substantially different to the 'per-protocol' analysis that effectively reached similar conclusions.</P>
<P>For both the STILE trial (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>), and the Ouriel trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouriel-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouriel 1998a</LINK>), the reduction in surgery required after thrombolysis was based on an arbitrary gradation of intervention severity. Whilst not identical, there were close similarities. Less intervention ranged from no intervention or medical treatment, through thrombolysis, endarterectomy or graft revision, new graft placement and ultimately a major amputation, below-knee amputation and then finally above-knee amputation. Whilst the exact positioning of thrombolysis in this list may be considered debatable, it needs to be remembered that there is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year, despite the potential higher complications of haemorrhage and stroke with thrombolysis. Continuing ischaemia can be dealt with on an elective basis and not necessarily as an emergency procedure.</P>
<P>We still do not know the precise criteria to recommend for a participant's inclusion in a programme of initial thrombolysis. The cut-off (arbitrarily taken at less than or more than 14 days in the STILE trial), appears to be relatively short, but whether it should really be at seven, 14 or even 30 days remains open to debate.</P>
<P>The reports by Comerota and Weaver (<LINK REF="REF-Comerota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1996</LINK>) are post-hoc subgroup analyses of the STILE Trial (<LINK REF="STD-STILE-1994" TYPE="STUDY">STILE 1994</LINK>). We must therefore exercise caution in interpreting or extrapolating the results and conclusions. Nevertheless, there are some important points which have been discussed that should be considered in the potential design of any future studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:05:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence in favour of either initial thrombolysis or initial surgery as the preferred option in terms of limb salvage or death at one year, but there is a higher incidence of major complications with thrombolysis, including stroke and major haemorrhage. </P>
<P>Thrombolysis needs to be used only in carefully selected and monitored participants; fully informed consent needs to be obtained. The combined vascular surgical and vascular radiological team looking after the participant should consider the surgical and thrombolytic/endovascular options.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:05:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>All trials concerning thrombolysis and surgery need to classify and randomise participants according to the Ad Hoc Committee on reporting standards (<LINK REF="REF-Reporting-Standards" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reporting Standards</LINK>). No data exists in support of treating participants with a long duration of symptomatic history. Future trials should look at the use of thrombolysis in those participants who traditionally have been considered suitable for peripheral arterial thrombolysis, i.e. those with a duration of ischaemic history of up to 30 days.</P>
<P>Future studies should also consider the quality of life implications of initial surgery compared to initial thrombolysis management.</P>
