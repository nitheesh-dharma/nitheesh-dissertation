<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>What are the effects of statins on delaying the onset and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>AMD is a progressive disease of the macula (area in the back of the eye affecting central vision). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over 65 years in industrialized countries. Studies have shown that some of the factors that may lead to heart disease and strokes are the same as those that may lead to AMD. Statins are a type of drug that aims to lower blood cholesterol levels. As statins are very effective in preventing strokes, it is possible that they are also protective for AMD.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We included two trials (144 total participants) in this review. Participants included men and women, most of whom were older than 50 years, who had good visual acuity. Participants were either susceptible to or had been diagnosed with an early stage of AMD. Both trials compared simvastatin with placebo. The larger trial, with 114 participants and conducted in Australia, used a higher dose of 40 mg per day and had a treatment period of three years. The smaller trial, with 30 participants and conducted in Italy, used a lower dose of 20 mg per day and had a treatment period of three months. The evidence provided in this review was up-to-date as of March 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Neither trial provided sufficient evidence to determine whether statins are effective in delaying the onset or progression of AMD. Information was lacking for outcomes related to vision, quality of life, and adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The overall quality of the evidence was low. In the smaller trial, the number of participants enrolled and the short treatment period may not have been sufficient for detecting the effect of statins on AMD, which develops over time. In the larger trial, 30% of participants did not attend the three-year follow-up visit, and the amount of missing data hindered our ability to draw any reliable conclusions for this trial.</P>

<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, late-onset disorder of the macula affecting central vision. It is the leading cause of blindness in people over 65 years in industrialized countries. Recent epidemiologic, genetic, and pathological evidence has shown that AMD shares a number of risk factors with atherosclerosis, leading to the hypothesis that statins may exert protective effects in AMD.</P>

<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-28 16:38:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two RCTs with a total of 144 participants met the selection criteria. Both trials compared simvastatin versus placebo in older people (older than 50 or 60 years) with high risk of developing AMD (drusen present on examination). Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be low, as we downgraded all outcomes due to limitations in the designs of the trials and insufficient outcome reporting. The larger trial, with 114 participants, was conducted in Australia and used a higher dose (40 mg daily) of simvastatin for three years. Participants and study personnel in this trial were adequately masked, however data were missing for 30% of participants at three years' follow-up. The smaller trial, with 30 participants, was conducted in Italy and used a lower dose (20 mg) of simvastatin for three months. This trial reported insufficient details to assess the risk of bias.</P>
<P>Neither trial reported data for change in visual acuity. Low-quality evidence from the smaller trial, with 30 participants, did not show a statistically significant difference between the simvastatin and placebo groups in visual acuity values at three months of treatment (decimal visual acuity 0.21 ± 0.56 in simvastatin group and 0.19 ± 0.40 in placebo group) or 45 days after the completion of treatment (decimal visual acuity 0.20 ± 0.50 in simvastatin group and 0.19 ± 0.48 in placebo group). The lack of a difference in visual acuity was not explained by lens or retina status, which remained unchanged during and after the treatment period for both groups.</P>
<P>Preliminary analyses of 42 participants who had completed 12 months' follow-up in the larger trial did not show a statistically significant difference between simvastatin and the placebo groups for visual acuity, drusen score, or visual function (effect estimates and confidence intervals were not available). Complete data for these outcomes at three years' follow-up were not reported. At three years, low-quality evidence showed an effect of simvastatin in slowing progression of AMD compared with placebo to be uncertain (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.09).</P>
<P>One trial did not report adverse outcomes. The second trial reported no difference between groups in terms of adverse events such as death, muscle aches, and acute hepatitis.</P>

<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, late-onset disorder of the macula that affects central vision. Although the leading cause of blindness in people over 65 years in industrialized countries (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2003</LINK>), its pathogenesis is not clearly understood. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of the disease.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The prevalence, incidence, and rate of progression of AMD increase with age. The prevalence of any AMD (referred to as age-related maculopathy) in the Beaver Dam Eye Study was less than 10% in people aged 43 to 54 years, but more than tripled for people aged 75 to 85 years (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2001</LINK>). Joint data from the United States, Netherlands, and Australia indicate the prevalence for late AMD is 0.2% in people 55 to 64 years old, rising sharply to 13% in people over 85 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>). The 10-year incidence of early AMD and late AMD was 12.1% and 2.1%, respectively in the Beaver Dam Eye Study (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). Individuals 75 years of age or older at baseline had significantly higher 10-year incidences of both early and advanced AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). The main risk factors for the development and progression of AMD include increasing age, smoking, and ethnicity. Other reported risk factors include low levels of antioxidants, dietary fat, heart disease, hypertension, genetic influences, alcohol consumption, and sunlight (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2014</LINK>). Most of the epidemiologic studies have based their conclusions on few incident cases of advanced AMD. Also, the long intervals between follow-up examinations or population surveys have meant that some incident cases were likely to have been missed due to deaths, so that the incidence and progression of AMD could not be assessed reliably.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The early manifestations of AMD are the presence of yellowish deposits known as drusen or retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities such as hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation observed during retinal examination of eyes. In general, these early clinical signs are not associated with significant vision loss. However, a proportion of people with drusen and pigmentary changes will progress to advanced AMD with geographic atrophy (large area of atrophy centered in the macula) or choroidal revascularization, both of which can have severe effects on central visual function (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAPT-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPT 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2005</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-15 06:38:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The treatments currently used for neovascular AMD include agents that interfere with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as ranibizumab (Lucentis), bevacizumab (Avastin), and aflibercept (Eylea). Administration of these drugs, however, requires multiple intravitreous injections. Although the neovascularization may no longer appear to be 'active', visual recovery or preservation is neither complete nor universal. The risks and benefits of long-term use are unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2014</LINK>). Photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy were shown to have some benefit in preventing severe visual loss in a small proportion of people with neovascular AMD, and only for a limited time after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-MPS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MPS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virgili-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgili 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2007</LINK>). The evidence as to the benefits and harms of surgical injection or implantation of steroids with antiangiogenic properties for treating neovascular AMD is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Geltzer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geltzer 2013</LINK>). Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements were revealed in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) to reduce progression to advanced AMD, both the neovascular ('wet') form and the geographic atrophy ('dry') form, in people with intermediate AMD (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>). However, aside from the AREDS formulation, there is no proven medical intervention for preventing the onset and progression of this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2012b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-07-28 16:13:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The burden of disease would be greatly diminished if a treatment could prevent or delay the onset of early AMD or the progression of early AMD to advanced AMD. Epidemiologic, genetic, and pathological evidence has shown that a number of risk factors are shared by AMD and atherosclerosis, leading to suggestions that statins, which are known to be beneficial in people with atherosclerotic disease and hyperlipidemia, may exert protective effects in AMD.</P>
<P>Possible pharmacological mechanisms of statins in preventing AMD include the following (<LINK REF="REF-Guymer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guymer 2005</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Serum lipid-lowering effects: statins may alter the deposition or resorption characteristics, or both, of lipids in Bruch's membrane (a thin, semi-permeable cellular structure that acts as the basement membrane for the retinal pigment epithelium and effectively mediates metabolic exchange between the retina and the choroid).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Preserving vascular supply: statins may preserve vascular supply to the outer retina through a protective effect against atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The anti-inflammatory actions of statins: inflammation may be important in AMD pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Penfold-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penfold 2001</LINK>). The anti-inflammatory properties of statins may provide additional protective effects. Statins down-regulate the activation of transcription factors NF-B, AP-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1. They therefore have potentially anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects that are relevant in the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Dichtl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dichtl 2003</LINK>). Elevated intraocular levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have an important role in the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in AMD. Prior work indicates that statins reduce plasma levels of VEGF and down-regulate transcription factors involved in VEGF expression. It is therefore conceivable that systemic statin use may reduce the incidence and progression of CNV via such cellular and molecular effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dichtl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dichtl 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The antioxidant effect of statins: oxidized lipids and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) may be the initial stimulus leading to inflammation in AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Gurne-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurne 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spaide-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spaide 1999</LINK>). Statins may protect the outer retina, Bruch's membrane, and choroid from oxidative damage.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Inhibition of metalloproteinases: statins may also inhibit secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, which may be involved in fissuring and rupture of plaques and development of neovascularization (<LINK REF="REF-Guymer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guymer 2005</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-28 16:14:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The high prevalence of AMD, the anticipated increase in the aged population, and the limited role of available effective treatments highlight the need to search for new treatment strategies for preventing or delaying onset or progression of AMD. A number of observational studies have examined the relationship between AMD and the use of statins; the results have been contradictory. In the Rotterdam Study, those using statins for more than 12 months had a similar incidence of AMD to those not using these drugs (adjusted hazard ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.9) (<LINK REF="REF-van-Leeuwen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Leeuwen 2003</LINK>). The Beaver Dam Eye Study found the five-year incidence of neovascular AMD not to be associated with statin use (odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.78) (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2001</LINK>). A more recent analysis by Klein et al found that a history of statin use was not associated with the five-year incidence of early AMD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91), progression of AMD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78), or incidence of late AMD (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.69) (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2007b</LINK>). The Women's Health Initiative Sight Examination (WHISE), an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative's clinical trial of hormone replacement therapy, reported similar negative results (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2007a</LINK>). One study suggests increased risk with statin use (<LINK REF="REF-McGwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGwin 2006</LINK>). By contrast, animal experiments showed that pitavastatin (so-called vascular statin) suppressed the formation and development of CNV in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Sagara-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagara 2007</LINK>). A strong inverse association between statin use and AMD was reported by Hall et al in a cross-sectional study with 392 participants (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.83) and by McGwin et al in a study that involved 550 cases of AMD and 5500 controls (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.45) (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGwin 2003</LINK>). Tan et al found that statin use was protective for indistinct soft drusen (hazard ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.84), a key late AMD precursor lesion, based on their analysis of data from the Blue Mountains Eye Study (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2007</LINK>). In a population-based cohort study, Smeeth et al assessed the effect of statins on a range of health outcomes. A sample of 129,288 people who initiated treatment with a statin were compared with a matched sample of 600,241 people who did not initiate treatment. The hazard ratio of AMD among non-exposed to exposed study participants was 1.17 (99% CI 1.00 to 1.38), providing no evidence to support a beneficial effect of statin treatment with respect to AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2009</LINK>). Observational and animal studies have methodological limitations and may be subject to bias and confounding. A systematic collection and summary of currently available data from high-quality clinical trials provide the best evidence regarding this issue.</P>

This review did not find sufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of statins to prevent or delay the progression of AMD.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-14 07:03:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Martini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martini 1991</LINK>, had a small sample size of 30 participants at an early stage of disease. The other trial, <LINK REF="STD-Guymer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guymer 2013</LINK>, had a larger sample size of 114 participants, but 30% of participants missed the three-year follow-up. The evidence appears to be incomplete given that slightly less than one-third of the participants did not complete the last follow-up visit in the largest trial. The two included trials were limited to simvastatin. It is unknown whether other statins have similar or different effects. Since the studies included participants with early AMD, this evidence is applicable to people at an earlier stage of the disease; the applicability of these findings to those with advanced AMD is unknown. The primary outcomes differed between the two studies, and neither trial reported change in visual acuity at three years' follow-up as an outcome. The trials were conducted in Italy and Australia, and the applicability of this evidence to other settings, such as the US and low- to -middle-income countries, is unknown. Limited information was available on whether findings were different across age and gender categories.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-28 16:17:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martini 1991</LINK> assessed visual acuity at the completion of treatment (three months from baseline) and 45 days afterwards. Due to the slow, progressive nature of the disease, the short duration of treatment and follow-up may not provide useful information about the effectiveness of treatment because it may be too short to show an effect. In addition, we judged the trial as unclear for all risk of bias domains because of insufficient reporting of methodological details. Although no ophthalmological adverse effects were reported during the study period, there was still a degree of uncertainty about the accuracy of this finding because of the short follow-up period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guymer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guymer 2013</LINK> assessed progression and onset of AMD at three-year follow-up. However, the level of missing data was about 30% and the trial investigators used the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for the missing data. This method of dealing with missing data is not robust and may not be appropriate in assessing outcomes for progressive diseases, thus making the conclusions unreliable.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-03 14:48:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane in order to minimize potential biases in the review process.</P>
<P>The absence of evidence on harms in the <LINK REF="STD-Martini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martini 1991</LINK> trial may relate to the short duration of follow-up and inadequate power of the trial to detect meaningful differences in important but infrequent events between treatment groups. The long-term treatment and follow-up of the participants in the larger <LINK REF="STD-Guymer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guymer 2013</LINK> trial provide more information about the effectiveness of treatment and the potential harms; however, caution is needed in interpreting these results as data were missing for a substantial proportion of participants.</P>

<P>The American Academy of Ophthalmology does not list statins as a treatment option for AMD, which is consistent with our finding of inadequate evidence to support the use of statins to slow progression of early AMD.

<P>There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to justify the use of statins to delay the onset and progression of AMD or to improve visual acuity. The American Academy of Ophthalmology does not list statins as a treatment option for AMD, which is consistent with the results of the review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-15 07:28:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Challenges exist in answering the question of whether statins have beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of AMD. Due to the slow progressive nature of the disease, trials with a short duration of treatment or follow-up, or with a small sample size, provide limited information about the effectiveness of statins in the prevention and treatment of AMD. Given that direct treatments for AMD are available (for example anti-VEGF therapy), and a large proportion of older adults in Western populations are already on statins, it is unlikely that a new RCT would be designed to answer this question specifically. We envision that subsequent data addressing the effectiveness of statins for AMD would come from RCTs evaluating a separate clinical question in which AMD participants are included as a subgroup or AMD is analyzed as a secondary outcome. Future updates of this systematic review may provide conclusive findings that answer this question.</P>
