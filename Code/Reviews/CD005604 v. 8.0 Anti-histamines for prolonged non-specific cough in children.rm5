Whilst the discussion makes clear that Cetirizine is effective in the small trial of patients with allergic rhinitis and chough (Hay Fever by any other name) this is not clear from the abstract and I am more concerned about the generalisability of the trial than its size. I have added some red text to the abstract and synopsis to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References : checked by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Please report the quality scores for each area of the 3 reviews rather than just that the quality was high in 2 or 3 areas please?

I have made a couple of style changes removing etc from the list of exclusions and changing REVMAN to RevMan. At some point I would be interested to know whether Anne thinks that cough receptor sensivitiy (which has the advantage of being objective) is really important to the children, whereas it is easy to see that cough frequency matters considerably.

</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-29 09:51:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Children with non-specific cough are commonly treated with a variety of medications to treat the symptom of cough. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-histamines in children with prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease, that is, non-specific chronic cough. We included three therapeutic studies with 182 randomised participants. Two studies found that chronic cough significantly improved in both treatment and placebo groups with no difference between the two groups. One small study however described that children who had chronic cough associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis treated with cetirizine improved significantly more than children on placebo and this difference was evident by two weeks. Four studies that evaluated safety profiles included 3166 randomised participants and described a non significant increase in cough in participants who received the active medication. Despite the limitations of this review, our findings are similar to the review on anti-histamines for acute cough which showed no good evidence for or against the use of anti-histamines. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti-histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough. Further research examining the effects of this treatment using child appropriate cough outcome measures is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including anti-histamines. Also, anti-histamines are advocated as an empirical treatment in adults with chronic cough. </P>

<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of anti-histamines in treating children with prolonged non-specific cough.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-12 06:57:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The latest searches were performed in November 2009.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-29 09:51:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Three included therapeutic studies had 182 randomised participants with 162 completing the trials although in one study, children with recurrent wheeze were also included. The four included safety evaluation studies randomised 3166 participants with 2862 completing the trials. Clinical heterogeneity was evident and limited data prevented combining data for meta-analysis. The two larger therapeutic studies described significant improvement in both the intervention and the placebo/placebo-like arms with no significant difference between the two groups. In the study with the smallest sample size, cetirizine (a second generation anti-histamine) was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing chronic cough in children associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and the effect was seen within two weeks of therapy. In contrast three of the larger evaluation studies that enrolled children with allergic rhinitis described a non-significant increase in cough as an adverse event. Combined data from the four safety evaluation studies revealed a non-significant difference between groups (OR 1.47 , 95% CI 0.86, 2.49) for cough as an adverse event but the trend favoured the placebo arm.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review has significant limitations. However, our finding of uncertain efficacy of anti-histamines for chronic cough are similar to that for acute cough in children. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti-histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough. If anti-histamines were to be trialled in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (time to response) occurs within two weeks of therapy. However the use of anti-histamines in children with non-specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of adverse events especially in very young children. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-19 14:25:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to general practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>) and causes significant anxiety to parents (<LINK REF="REF-Cornford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornford 1993</LINK>). Worldwide the desire to reduce the impact of the symptom of cough is reflected in the billions of dollars spent on over the counter cough and cold medications. Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>). While some children with chronic non-specific cough have asthma, the majority do not (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). In adults, chronic cough is defined as cough of over eight weeks duration but the definition commonly accepted in children is that of over three to four weeks, based on the known differences between paediatric and adult cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2005b</LINK>). </P>
<P>The association of atopy with respiratory symptoms has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Busquets-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busquets 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clough-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clough 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clifford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mertsola-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertsola 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peat-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peat 1990</LINK>). Some studies described an association (<LINK REF="REF-Peat-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peat 1990</LINK>) but others have not when confounders were accounted for (<LINK REF="REF-Mertsola-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertsola 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clough-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clough 1994</LINK>). A study also found that children with recurrent cough were no more atopic than controls (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1997</LINK>). Pharmaceutical allergy treatments include the use of H<SUB>1</SUB> receptor antagonists widely known as anti-histamines. Histamine is a mediator in allergic response and is secreted by mast cells, monocytes and basophils. Anti-histamines are classed into first generation anti-histamines (such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, and clemastine) and the newer (second generation) non sedating anti-histamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine) which have less central nervous system side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2005</LINK>). The first generation anti-histamines are not highly selective and also block muscarinic receptors and thus have some anti-cholinergic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>In adults, monotherapy with anti-histamines is advocated as an empirical treatment for chronic cough in American and European guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Morice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1998</LINK>). Cochrane systematic reviews have shown that anti-histamines are efficacious for acute cough (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK>) and when used as combination therapy for common colds but not as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>) in adults. In contrast to adults, in children anti-histamines either as a monotherapy or as combined therapy are not efficacious for relieving acute cough and are associated with significant adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK>). However, the aetiology and management of acute cough is not necessarily the same as that for chronic cough. Furthermore, some have advocated that the management of children with chronic cough should be similar to that of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1998</LINK>). A systematic review of the benefits or harm of anti-histamines for chronic non specific cough or both would thus be useful to help guide clinical practice.</P>

<LI>Allocation concealment. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Adequate concealment, Grade B: Unclear, Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Blinding. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Participant and care provider and outcome assessor blinded, Grade B: Outcome assessor blinded, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: No blinding of outcome assessor (Grade A, B = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Reporting of participants by allocated group. Trials were scored as: Grade A: The progress of all randomised children in each group described, Grade B: Unclear or no mention of withdrawals or dropouts, Grade C: The progress of all randomised children in each group clearly not described. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Follow up. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Outcomes measured in &gt; 90% (where withdrawals due to complications and side-effects are categorised as treatment failures), Grade B: Outcomes measured in 80 to 90%, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: Outcomes measured in &lt; 80%. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
</OL>
<P>While only the allocation concealment quality assessment was displayed in the meta-analysis figures, all assessments were included in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Inter-reviewer reliability for the identification of high quality studies for each component was measured by the Kappa statistic. Quality of the studies were also assessed using Revman's 'Bias tool'.</P>

<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, it was planned that relative and absolute risk reductions would have been calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies of all the individually analysed studies was performed to examine whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This was to take into account the differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>

<P>It was planned that results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest would be included in meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed-effect model) would have been calculated (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 5).

The cough indices would have been assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes could be estimated (mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference would have been estimated.

<P>The Airways Group specialised register/search identified 330 potentially relevant titles in the 2005 search. After assessing the abstracts, 24 papers were retrieved and 21 potential studies were considered (<I>see '</I>Characteristics of excluded studies' table). The main reason for non-eligibility of studies for review criteria was the age of the participants (adult based studies). Two papers included small numbers of adolescents. No additional data could be obtained from authors and data specific to children could not be separated. Thus these papers were also excluded. Three studies were included (<I>see 'Characteristics of included studies' </I>table), two were single centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) and one was a multi centre study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) that was supported by commercial interest. All studies were published in full and all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) were published in English. In the 2006 search, no new studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Four papers were retrieved and three were added to the excluded studies table. In the 2007 search, five papers were retrieved and two of these were non-therapeutic studies but were primarily on the safety of anti-histamines (fexofenadine (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>) and levocetirizine (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>)); in both studies cough was reported as an outcome measure as an adverse event. In the 2008 search, two studies were identified; one (<LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>) directly from the search and the second (Meltzer 2004) from the review article (<LINK REF="REF-Mansfield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansfield 2008</LINK>) identified from the search.

<P>All studies that were therapeutic studies included cough as a major inclusion criteria but one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) also included children with wheeze i.e. presence of chronic cough or wheeze was an inclusion criteria. One study was in very young children (age 6 to 36 months), and two other studies were in older children (mean age 8.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) and 11.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) years). In these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) children also had allergic rhinitis. Two studies utilised parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) and one was a cross over study (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>). The safety evaluation studies were large multi-centre studies performed in young children (&lt; 6 years) with allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>) or atopy (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>) was however a mixture of both therapeutic (for allergy) and safety study. As cough was not an outcome in the score for the therapeutic component, the study was grouped as a 'safety evaluation study'. None of the studies utilised objective measurement of cough or quality of life measurements.</P>
<P>Length of intervention in the therapeutic studies varied from two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) to 16 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). In the safety evaluation studies, the length of intervention was at least 7 days in one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>), two weeks in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>) and the 18 months in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>). Of the therapeutic studies, one study utilised a first generation (sedating) anti-histamine (pimethixen) (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) and another utilised a second generation, non sedating anti-histamine (cetirizine) (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>). The third study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) utilised ketotifen, a unclassified anti-histamine which also has some mast cell stabilising properties (<LINK REF="REF-Abelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abelson 2004</LINK>). One study compared ketotifen to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>), one compared cetirizine to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) and the Danish study compared a locally produced over the counter mixture to pimethixen. The safety evaluations studies utilised fexofenadine (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>) and levocetirizine (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>). The sample size of the therapeutic studies were generally small (n = 20 in <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>), 49 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1989</LINK> and 113 in <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) compared to the safety evaluation studies. The small study did not specify whether there were equal numbers in both arms of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>). The inclusion criteria in three of the 4 evaluation studies were children with symptomatic allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>) and in the fourth, (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>) children were atopic.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for all studies were subjective cough scales of varying types. Two studies had outcome assessments on multiple occasions (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) and all provided cough as an outcome measure.

<P>For the therapeutic studies, the quality score varied with no study scoring 'high quality' in all four categories. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) scored 'high quality' in three categories and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) had high quality points for two categories. The reason for the difference between the three studies is because the latter two study had a withdrawal rate of &gt; 10% of participants. None of the studies clearly described their method of randomisation and allocation concealment was unclear in all studies. Method of blinding (that is, appearance of placebo) was clearly described in one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). Agreement between the two main review authors (AC and MM) for quality of studies was excellent; weighted kappa was 0.74 for quality assessment.</P>

<P>The three studies with cough as inclusion criteria (that is, therapeutic studies) included 182 randomised participants with 162 completing the trials. The additional four studies that evaluated safety of the medications included 3166 randomised participants with 2862 completing the trials. The two larger therapeutic studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) found no significant difference between treatment and placebo arms but the very small study (n = 20 in total) (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) found a significant difference between the groups. In the multicentre study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>), only 13 (11%) children had chronic cough alone, the rest of the participants had cough with wheeze. The authors could not provide data specific to the cough group alone. Considering all participants, Van Asperen and colleagues reported that the "percentage of symptom free days increased significantly in both groups (P &lt; 0.005) with placebo-treated infants experiencing more symptom-free days compared with the ketotifen group (P &lt; 0.01)" (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). Given the limitation of cough specific data, it was not possible to combine any data for meta-analysis from the therapeutic studies.</P>
<P>In the safety evaluation studies (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>), cough or increased cough, was reported as an adverse event and these could be combined in a forest plot (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Combined data from the four safety evaluation studies revealed a non-significant difference between groups (OR 1.47 , 95% CI 0.86, 2.49) for cough as an adverse event but the trend favoured the placebo arm. These data are presented in a the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK> study described significant improvement in allergy rhinitis score (cough not present in score) but with a non-significant increase in cough as an adverse event (19 of 1110 in active arm and 6 of 700 in placebo arm) in the anti-histamine arm compared to placebo.</P>
<P>Summary of specific outcomes as reported by the therapeutic studies are as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical failures/success</HEADING>
<P>Subjective assessment of treatment as assessed by parent(s) and by investigator was not significantly different between treatment (ketotifen) and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). The proportion as reported by parents to have had good/very good efficacy was 29/52 in the ketotifen arm versus 26/50 in placebo arm (observed difference between proportions = 0.04, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.23). Symptom free proportions were also similar between groups on pimethixen and paradryl (34/45 versus 31/45; observed difference between proportions = 0.07, 95%CI -0.12 to 0.25) (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>). In contrast, the study on cetirizine reported that "cetirizine's overall therapeutic effectiveness was judged satisfactory in all patients...."; data on placebo was not provided (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>). Success and failures were not relevant in the safety evaluation studies. However the study on fexofenadine reported cough increased in 10 children who received fexofenadine compared to seven who received placebo. The second safety evaluation study reported four in the levocetirizine arm had cough versus two in the placebo arm. Combining these studies, there was no significant difference between groups (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7 to 3.82) but the trend was reduced participants with cough in the placebo arm compared to the active arms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mean differences in cough scores</HEADING>
<P>Despite the large difference in sample size of the studies, both studies with a longer intervention period (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) provided the mean of the group's cough score at the various time points. However, data could not be combined in a meta-analysis as data specific to children with chronic cough was not available in one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). Authors of this study reported that day and night time cough scores significantly decreased with time with no difference between the treatment (ketotifen) and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). In the cetirizine versus placebo study, cough scores were significantly less in the cetirizine group when compared to the placebo group (P = 0.01 for week two and three, P = 0.02 on week four) (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>).The third study did not provide data on mean cough scores (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Time to response</HEADING>
<P>In Ciprandi and colleagues' four week study, the difference between treatment and placebo arm was evident by the second week.

As the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) did not find a difference between groups, 'time to response' was not relevant in these studies.</P>

Statistical calculation however showed that this difference was not significantly different (observed difference 0.14, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.33). Most of the events reported were minor with irritability and gastrointestinal upset being the most common events. In four children (two each in both arms of the study), adverse events lead to withdrawal of the child from the study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). In Christensen and colleagues' study, 12 children described sedation (with three being severe) during pimethixen treatment where as 13 described mild to moderate sedation during paradryl treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-07 15:54:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This systematic review found seven studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, three were therapeutic studies and four safety evaluation studies. The review is limited by the lack of appropriate data; meta-analysis could be only be performed in the safety evaluation studies. Results from the two larger therapeutic studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) which described no beneficial effect is in contrast to the small study (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) which showed that cetirizine, a second generation anti-histamine, was beneficial in reducing cough associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The combined data from the safety evaluations studies showed a non-significant difference in number of participants with cough but the direction of effect was in favour of the placebo arm. In three of these four studies, children with allergic rhinitis were enrolled.</P>
<P>The three included therapeutic studies were different in several ways. Firstly, some clinical heterogeneity was present in the participants of the studies; although all studies were in children with chronic cough, the participants in one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) were very young whereas the participants in the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) were older. Secondly, all three studies used a different type of anti-histamine. Adult cohort data suggest that first generation anti-histamines are more efficacious than second generation anti-histamines in reducing chronic cough; indeed the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommends the use first generation anti-histamines for adults with chronic cough (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>). In contrast, the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology which lists chronic cough as one of the many factors when assessing patients with allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2003</LINK>) recommends the use of second generation anti-histamines as first line therapy for children with allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Dykewicz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykewicz 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dykewicz-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykewicz 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirdly, in two therapeutic studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) children had allergic rhinitis and arguably anti-histamines would be more efficacious in these children. However, interpretation of this data has be taken in the light that, although a minority of children with allergic rhinitis have co-existent cough, the cause and effect is less clear and indeed controversial as reported in reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2006</LINK>). Fourthly, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>) were placebo controlled and the third (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) was not. We included the study that compared an anti-histamine to an OTC that consisted of ammonium acetate and ephedrine as OTCs are not efficacious for acute cough in children (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>). While it possible that the use of this would have reduced the demonstrable effect of the anti-histamine in the study, it is more likely that the anti-histamine was not efficacious; Christensen and colleagues' study (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>) had a sample size 2.5 times that of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) that found some benefit. Lastly, the studies also differed in sample size from very small (n = 20; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 1997</LINK>) to a much larger sample size (n = 113; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies reported on adverse events in both treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1992</LINK>). When we calculated the proportions we found no significant differences between the groups. The medical literature however reports that the adverse effects of anti-histamines, in particular first generation anti-histamines, include sedation, paradoxic excitability, dizziness, respiratory depression, hallucinations, arrhythmia (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>) and death (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2001</LINK>). Thus the use of anti-histamines has to be balanced with its associated adverse events. Second generation anti-histamines have less adverse effects. Indeed in the safety evaluation studies (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2007</LINK>) cough as an adverse event occurred more frequently in the active arms then in the placebo arm although the difference was not significant.</P>
<P>Despite the limitations of this review, our findings are similar to that of the non substantial efficacy of anti-histamines for acute cough in children (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK>) as well as that for colds in children (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>). In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>), anti-histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>With the lack of evidence, the routine use of anti-histamines in treating children with non-specific cough cannot be recommended and is arguably contra-indicated in young children because of its side effects. If anti-histamines are to be trialled in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (time to response) occurs within two weeks of therapy. However the use of anti-histamines in children with non-specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of adverse events especially in very young children. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of anti-histamines to determine the effectiveness in treating children with non-specific cough are clearly needed. Trials should be parallel studies and double blinded given the known problems in studying cough, specifically the large placebo and time period effects. Safety data should also be incorporated. Based on a single RCT, a short trial of two weeks would suffice. Outcome measures for the clinical studies on cough should be clearly defined using validated subjective data and supported by objective data if possible. </P>
