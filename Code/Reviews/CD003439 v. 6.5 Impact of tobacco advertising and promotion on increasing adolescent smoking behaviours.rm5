<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-13 23:00:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advertising is the use of media to create positive product imagery or associations. Promotion or marketing is the mix of activities designed to increase sales. There are no trials of the impact of tobacco advertising and promotional activities on people taking up smoking. However, there are studies following nonsmokers and their exposure to advertising (such as the number of tobacco advertisements in the magazines they read). The review found that in all these studies, nonsmoking adolescents who were more aware of or receptive to tobacco advertising were more likely to become smokers later.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-05 14:22:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>We selected longitudinal studies that assessed individuals' smoking behaviour and exposure to advertising, receptivity or attitudes to tobacco advertising, or brand awareness at baseline, and assessed smoking behaviour at follow ups. Participants were adolescents aged 18 or younger who were not regular smokers at baseline.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-05 14:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Nineteen longitudinal studies that followed up a total of over 29,000 baseline nonsmokers met inclusion criteria. The studies measured exposure or receptivity to advertising and promotion in a variety of ways, including having a favourite advertisement or an index of receptivity based on awareness of advertising and ownership of a promotional item. One study measured the number of tobacco advertisements in magazines read by participants. All studies assessed smoking behaviour change in participants who reported not smoking at baseline. In 18 of the 19 studies the nonsmoking adolescents who were more aware of tobacco advertising or receptive to it, were more likely to have experimented with cigarettes or become smokers at follow up. There was variation in the strength of association, and the degree to which potential confounders were controlled for.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-24 09:53:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. Based on the strength and specificity of this association, evidence of a dose-response relationship, the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-05 14:35:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The tobacco industry maintains that the sole purpose of tobacco advertising is to maintain and increase market shares of adult consumers. Yet there is research evidence that adolescents are aware of, recognize, and are influenced by tobacco advertising. The U.S. Surgeon General's 1994 comprehensive review of the tobacco marketing literature concluded that advertising and promotional activities influence key risk factors for tobacco use among adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1994</LINK>). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 1995 review of available tobacco industry documents concluded that "cigarette manufacturers know that young people are vital to their market and that they need to develop advertising and other promotional activities that appeal to young people" (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1995</LINK>). These documents reveal that companies conducted extensive research on campaigns of new brands that were launched with youth as the target. More recent reviews confirm this (<LINK REF="REF-Pollay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, Article 13 of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control stipulates a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Advertising can be defined as the use of media to create positive product imagery or positive product associations or to connect the product with desirable personal traits, activities or outcomes. Promotion, also called marketing, can be defined as the mix of all activities that are designed to increase sales (<LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK>). Tobacco companies are amongst the top 10 advertisers in 21 out of 50 countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East (<LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK>). In the United States cigarette companies are required to report their expenditure on advertising and promotion annually to the Federal Trade Commission. The most recent data available (<LINK REF="REF-US-FTC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">US FTC 2009</LINK>) indicates that in 2006 the tobacco industry spent US$0.3 billion on advertising in newspapers, magazines, outdoor, transit and point of purchase. Promotional items given free with the purchase of cigarettes are included under the heading of 'retail value added' which includes offers such as 'buy one get one free'. This category accounts for US$1.4 billion of expenditure. The industry spent almost US$10.1 billion on 'promotional allowances'. This includes payments to ensure prominent shelf space and discounts to retailers in order to reduce the price for consumers, for example.</P>
<P>The purpose of tobacco marketing is to associate a product with psychological and social needs that the consumer wants to fulfil. This is accomplished through a restructuring of social reality that the advertising itself provides (<LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2003</LINK>). Tobacco marketing, including advertising and promotion, targets key concerns of adolescents such as social approval, peer bonding, autonomy, self-image and adventure seeking. These approaches are intended to influence behaviour both cognitively and affectively by suggesting that there are benefits to using the product and by setting up a positive attitude about the product. Images, rather than information, are used in tobacco marketing to portray the attractiveness and function of smoking. The images portrayed in advertisements appeal to adolescents and are remembered by them (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1994</LINK>). It is logical to conclude that because tobacco marketing capitalizes upon issues that are of great importance to adolescents, it is likely that adolescents are influenced to smoke cigarettes. Some tobacco control advocates argue that there is sufficient evidence from internal tobacco company documents to show that companies target marketing at minors and that this is effective. They argue that efforts to prove a causal link between advertising and smoking are unnecessary (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1993</LINK>). Given, however, that tobacco companies still attempt to deny this, and challenge attempts to control advertising in the courts, there remains a need to examine the evidence that there is a relationship between advertising and smoking uptake.</P>
<P>Randomized controlled trials of the effects of advertising would be unethical and impractical. In addition, advertising strategies and their effects are very complex. Even if true experiments were ethically possible with randomisation of exposure to advertising and promotion, they could not capture the vast array of marketing strategies that are employed by tobacco companies such as event sponsorship, and portrayal of smoking in movies, television programmes and popular music. Any true experiment might underestimate the overall effects of tobacco marketing because only a limited number of key factors could be studied at once.</P>
<P>Since experimental studies addressing this question cannot be conducted, we have to rely on observational studies. <LINK REF="REF-Susser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susser 1991</LINK> identifies criteria for evaluating causality of a suspected agent from epidemiological studies:<BR/>(1) it must clearly precede the hypothesized effect;<BR/>(2) the association is strong;<BR/>(3) the association is consistent;<BR/>(4) the association is specific;<BR/>(5) it should be expected from theory.<BR/>Properly conducted longitudinal studies that examine the relationship between exposure to marketing approaches and subsequent changes in smoking behaviours, while controlling for possible confounding factors, can provide evidence supporting the causal links between tobacco marketing and smoking behaviour. Longitudinal studies are particularly valuable because they capture what happens to individuals over time and can demonstrate whether individuals who differ in their exposure to advertising when they are not smoking, then differ in their future smoking behaviour. Bringing together the results of such research that supports or refutes an association between a measure of exposure to advertising and smoking among adolescents will be useful to policy and decision-makers responsible for developing and implementing population-based approaches to tobacco control.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to examine the influence of tobacco industry advertising and promotion on smoking behaviours among adolescents who are 18 years of age or younger. We asked the following question: <BR/>Is prior exposure to tobacco industry advertising and promotion associated with future smoking among adolescents? <BR/>Our logic model was that exposure to tobacco industry advertising and promotion increases awareness of cigarettes and engenders positive attitudes towards smoking that in turn lead to increased uptake. Our hypotheses were that <BR/>(a) exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion will predict future smoking behaviour;<BR/>(b) mediating variables that are on the causal pathway between exposure and behaviour such as brand awareness, receptivity, and positive attitudes towards advertising and promotion will predict future smoking behaviour. </P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered studies that examined the association between tobacco advertising and promotion, and adolescent smoking. We included only longitudinal studies in which individuals' smoking behaviour and exposure to advertising, receptivity or attitudes to tobacco advertising, or brand awareness were measured at baseline and individuals' smoking behaviours were then measured in one or more follow ups. Cross-sectional and time-series or econometric studies were excluded from this review. The rationale for this is presented in the Discussion section.</P>

<P>Studies that included adolescents 18 years of age or younger were reviewed. Studies that included a broader age range were excluded if the results for adolescents under 18 years of age could not be separated out. We focused on results for participants who were nonsmokers at baseline.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-22 17:20:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Allison ">
<P>The 'intervention' is tobacco mass media advertising by the industry, including tobacco promotion. Mass media channels of communication include advertising delivered through television, radio, newspapers, billboards, posters etc. Tobacco promotion includes give-aways such as T-shirts and other items bearing tobacco industry logos. In practice the measure of exposure to the intervention may not discriminate between specific types of advertising, since adolescents are exposed to many sources. Indices of receptivity to advertising which use measures such as having a favourite advertisement, and ownership of or willingness to own promotional items could be used as indicators of exposure.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>There were four stages in the review process: <BR/>1. Studies identified in the electronic search were prescreened for relevance by a reviewer. Articles were rejected if the title and abstract did not focus on the impact of tobacco advertising or promotion on adolescent smoking behaviour. If the article could not be rejected with certainty, the full text was obtained and screened by two reviewers. <BR/>2. Two reviewers independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. <BR/>3. One reviewer extracted data from included studies using a form and the second reviewer checked these data. <BR/>4. Studies were combined using qualitative narrative synthesis. We used narrative synthesis because there was heterogeneity among study designs, type of 'intervention', and outcomes measured. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The 'Intervention': Assessment of Advertising and Promotion</HEADING>
<P>Three main types of methods were used by studies in this review to assess tobacco advertising and promotion: receptivity to advertising; exposure to advertising; and perception of advertising.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Receptivity to Advertising</HEADING>
<P>Receptivity to tobacco advertising or promotional marketing was assessed in 11 of the reviewed studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>). Receptivity to advertising was operationalized in two ways: (1) being able to name a brand or favourite advertisement, or (2) owning or being willing to own a tobacco promotion item. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>) assessed receptivity by asking participants to both name a brand or favourite advertisement and if they own or are willing to own a promotion item. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> defined high receptivity as owning or being willing to own a promotional item and moderate receptivity as naming a favourite brand, with low receptivity being unwilling to own a promotional item and being unable to name a favourite brand. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>) assessed receptivity solely by asking participants to name a brand or favourite advertisement. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK> used number of brands recognized from three local billboard advertisements to measure awareness. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK>) assessed receptivity to advertising solely by asking participants if they owned or were willing to own a tobacco promotional item. An example of a survey item used to assess promotional items is <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK> who used the item; "Some tobacco companies make clothing, hats, bags or other things with the brand on it. Do you have a piece of clothing or other thing that has a tobacco brand name or logo on it?"</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>) focused on magazine and billboard advertisements. In eight of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>) survey items asked about advertising in general. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK> asked, "Of all the cigarette advertisements you have seen, which brand's ads do you think attract your attention the most?"</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exposure to Advertising</HEADING>
<P>Studies that measured exposure to advertising focused on magazines, billboards, other print advertisements, television, radio, and advertising in retail outlets. Pucci and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>) focused their study on magazine advertisements, <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> focused on television and small store retail advertisements, while <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK> focused on retail advertising only. <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK> focused on messaging from major media sources (television, radio, billboards, posters and magazines/newspapers). To measure exposure to advertisements, three studies used recall (<LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>), one used a combination of recall and observation (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>) and one used recall and analysis of magazine data (<LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>). The measure used by <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK> tested the specificity of cigarette advertisements by asking participants to identify the brand and how often they had seen the advertisement from a series of masked images of cigarette and other consumer advertisements. The measure used by <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>, although indirect, had the advantage of avoiding recall bias. In this study, <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> developed an index of 'gross impressions' derived from baseline reports of exposure to specific titles and number of pages devoted to cigarette advertising in those magazines. <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK> used three measures of exposure: (1) perceived exposure to cigarette advertising; (2) shopping frequency in stores most likely to contain cigarette advertising; and (3) a detailed item about how often students visited stores near the school, combined with observations conducted at those stores, to calculate estimated number of cigarette brand impressions per week.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The Outcome: Assessment of smoking and nonsmoking at baseline and follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Smoking status was measured at baseline in all studies. At follow up, smoking behaviour was analysed for respondents who were not identified as smokers at baseline, except for <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> who examined non-established smokers at baseline who progressed to established smokers at follow up and <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> who examined non-susceptible nonsmokers at baseline who became susceptible to smoking (including any lifetime smoking) at follow up.</P>
<P>Nonsmoking was defined in a variety of ways based on the timing of any smoking experience and the number of cigarettes consumed. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>) used the strictest cut off for nonsmokers, with nonsmoking based on never having tried a cigarette, even one puff. whereas six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>) defined nonsmokers as never having tried a cigarette, even a few puffs. In addition to never smoking, <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> used three additional questions to assess a strong commitment not to smoke.</P>
<P>The timeframe for questions regarding smoking behaviours ranged from the past four weeks (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>) or past 30 days (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK> to lifetime (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK> defined nonsmoking as no puff in the previous 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK> defined it as no puff in the previous four weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1998</LINK> did not define nonsmoking precisely, but divided smokers into experimental, weekly and daily. Analyses in this study considered both progression to any smoking and to regular (weekly or daily) smoking. One study used a different cut off between smoking/nonsmoking at baseline and follow up; <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> operationalized baseline smokers as those who had smoked even a puff, and at follow up classified smokers as those reporting at least one cigarette in the previous 30 days. <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK> classified nonsmokers as those who had never smoked a cigarette, smoked less than one cigarette per week, or were an ex-smoker. <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK> classified as nonsmokers both never-smokers and early experimenters who reported having even a puff or a single cigarette. At follow up they reported associations with progression to established smoking, defined as more than 100 cigarettes smoked, for both nonsmokers and the subgroup of never-smokers. <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK> distinguished between never-triers, experimenters who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes, and established smokers. Those who had never tried even a puff were further divided into susceptible and non susceptible groups. Nonsusceptible nonsmokers were those who responded "no" to the question "Do you think that you will try a cigarette anytime soon", and "definitely not" when asked if they would smoke if best friend offered a cigarette, and if they thought they would smoke a cigarette during the next year. At follow up the outcome was progression in smoking status, focusing on nonsusceptible nonsmokers at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK> used a similar scheme to Pierce and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>) for distinguishing susceptible and non susceptible never-smokers. They included a puffer category that had tried a cigarette, and subdivided a 2 -100 cigarettes experimenter group into those who had and had not smoked a cigarette in the previous 30 days. Baseline nonsmokers, puffers and experimenters were included in follow-up analyses using progression on the smoking index as the dependent variable. <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> dichotomized participants into two categories, nonsusceptible nonsmokers and all others, including experimenters and past 30-day smokers. If respondents reported lifetime smoking or susceptibility to smoking at follow up, they were classified as susceptible to smoking. Smoking susceptibility is thought to be a more sensitive measure than actual smoking among children and young adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK>) and has been previously validated by <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>At follow up, 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>) used a simple dichotomization between smokers and nonsmokers for analytic purposes. <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> also asked about specific brands smoked and <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK> also examined susceptibility to smoking at follow up. <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> dichotomized non-established smokers and established smokers, while <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> dichotomized nonsusceptible nonsmokers and those susceptible to smoking (reported any lifetime smoking or susceptibility to smoking). Five other studies used a more detailed classification of smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>). Of these <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK> used progression on a smoking index (puffer, experimenter, regular smoker) as the outcome rather than change from nonsmoker to smoker.</P>
<P>All but two studies used the same smoker/nonsmoker definition at baseline and follow up; <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> identified baseline smokers as those who had smoked even a puff, and at follow up classified smokers as those reporting at least one cigarette in the previous 30 days, and <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK> assessed life-time smoking at baseline and used a combined variable of life-time and current smoking at follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded Studies</HEADING>
<P>The reasons for excluding 96 studies are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. Excluded studies were mainly cross-sectional studies measuring advertising and smoking-related variables at a single point in time. We also excluded longitudinal studies using cross-sectional samples in which changes in an individual's behaviour were not tracked. We excluded five prospective study reports. In one the primary outcome was future intention to smoke at follow up, and the results did not distinguish between nonsmokers and current smokers at baseline or follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Aitken-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Aitken 1991</LINK>). A second longitudinal study investigated curiosity to smoke among baseline never smokers as a predictor of future smoking and did not measure exposure to tobacco advertising in the longitudinal analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2005</LINK>). We did not include, as a separate study, a paper that used the same data sources and methods as <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>, but focused on the subset who were already experimenters at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2002</LINK>). These results are described briefly with those of <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>. We also did not include <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2002</LINK>, which uses the same data sources as <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>, to report the relationship between receptivity to tobacco advertising and smoking initiation by more/less authoritative parenting style, and <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2004</LINK>, which uses the same data sources as <LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>, to examine characteristics of adolescent smoking trajectories.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Validity of Measures</HEADING>
<P>Tobacco advertising was assessed using self-report in all studies versus actual measures of exposure, thus there is a risk of self-reporting bias. If participants were reluctant to report smoking, this could have resulted in a failure to detect smoking or in misclassification of smoking status. There is evidence that self-report data is reasonably accurate (<LINK REF="REF-Dolcini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolcini 2003</LINK>). Eleven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>) did not report on validity and/or reliability of the advertising measure used.</P>
<P>Ten studies used some combination of favourite tobacco advertisement, owning a promotional item, and naming the brand of a favourite advertisement as a measure of receptivity (<LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>). These could be viewed as weak indicators of receptivity to advertising; it is possible that more direct measures of exposure would show stronger effects on smoking onset. For example, one study used a more objective measure of advertising by collecting data directly from magazines that participants reported they had read in the last 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>).The study by <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK> measured the perceived influence of cigarette advertising. Such a measure is problematic because it assumes that children appreciate the influence of advertising when the nature of this influence is almost certainly oblique and partially subconscious. In addition it assumes that children would be willing to admit being influenced by advertising (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1989</LINK>) and that perceptions about influence are independent of smoking behaviour. Admitting to being influenced may be determined by perceptions of the social acceptability of the behaviour promoted by the advertising. Young people who deny being influenced by advertising may do so because they consider smoking less socially acceptable, and this may reduce their likelihood of becoming smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Borzekowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borzekowski 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all the studies, smoking behaviour was measured using self-report items. To limit self-reporting bias, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK>) used the " bogus pipeline" technique, which has been shown to increase the validity of self-reports. In this technique, biochemical samples are collected and participants are told that their self-reports will be checked, but samples are not actually tested. <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK> also used a "pipeline" procedure to collect saliva for biochemical validation of self-reported smoking/smokeless tobacco use in the past 24 hours. With a cut off value of 25ng/ml, they correctly classified 97% (129/133) of non-users and 60% (3/5) of users. It should be noted that there is some evidence that biochemical validation is not valid in young adolescents who smoke intermittently (<LINK REF="REF-Dolcini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolcini 2003</LINK>). Ten studies did not report any information on the reliability and/or validity of the smoking measure used (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>State-wide household telephone surveys reported higher attrition rates (47-73%) than school-based surveys (64-97%). The state-wide surveys; however, also had the longest follow-up periods.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Representativeness of Sample</HEADING>
<P>Eleven of the studies were conducted in the United States. All of the states represented in these studies were part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. This agreement was enacted in the United States in 1998 between states&#8217; attorneys general and the tobacco industry. Under this agreement major tobacco manufacturers agreed not to&#8220;take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State.&#8221; Further, five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK>) were conducted in California which is widely recognized for its extensive public anti-tobacco campaigns and strict non-smoking policies.These contextual factors and other unique regional characteristics may have affected participants&#8217; attitudes about smoking and their willingness to report their smoking behaviour. Thus, caution is required in generalizing the results of these studies to adolescents in other regions and countries.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> focused on schools with large Asian American and Latino populations (25% or higher), thus results may not be generalizable to adolescents representing other ethnic groups and in other areas of the United States.

Findings are summarized below.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>) did not find a significant association between tobacco marketing receptivity and future smoking. This study found that those with moderate receptivity (naming the brand of your favourite cigarette advertisement) were more likely to be experimental smokers (12.5%) than never smokers (1.6%) at baseline; however, no significant association between receptivity to tobacco marketing and onset of smoking after two years was found (moderate receptivity: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.87; high receptivity: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.48).</P>
<P>A detailed description of findings from studies assessing receptivity is provided below:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK> examined the influence of adolescents' receptivity to tobacco industry promotional activities on movement toward addiction to smoking. Survey participants who in 1993 had never smoked and who would not consider experimenting with smoking were followed up in 1996 to assess any progression in smoking uptake. Having a favourite advertisement (moderate receptivity) at baseline predicted which adolescents would progress in smoking acquisition at follow up compared to minimally receptive group (odds ratio [OR] 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 3.20), possession or willingness to use a promotion item (high receptivity) predicted even higher likelihood of future progression (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 5.68) controlling for school performance and demographic characteristics. Half of adolescents (51.7%, 95% CI 46.3 to 57.1) who had a favourite advertisement at baseline and 62.1% (95% CI 52.6 to 71.6) who possessed or were willing to use a promotion item progressed toward smoking at follow up. Lower levels of receptivity to promotions did not predict progression toward addiction to smoking. In a secondary report on participants who were experimenters at baseline, high receptivity was a significant predictor of progression to established smoking (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.61, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity), whilst moderate receptivity was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK> found that 46% of nonsmoking adolescents (no more than one cigarette) who owned a tobacco promotion item and named a brand advertisement that attracted their attention (high receptivity) at baseline, progressed from not smoking or early experimenting to established smoking four years later. Further, 18% of adolescents who either owned an item or named a brand progressed toward established smoking (moderate receptivity), while only 14% who neither owned an item nor named a brand (low receptivity) progressed toward established smoking (2 = 28.9, P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for family and peer smoking adolescents, baseline smoking status and rebelliousness, those who were highly receptive at baseline were more than twice as likely to become established smokers by follow up (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.85). Among the subgroup of never-smoker (even a puff), 29% who were highly receptive at baseline had progressed to established smoking at follow up. The rates of uptake among moderate and low receptivity were 12% and 11% respectively (2=8.38, P &lt; 0.02).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK> reported that baseline tobacco advertising receptivity (naming your favourite brand or willing to own a promotional item) significantly increased the odds of progressing to a higher level of smoking between 9th and 12th grade (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.19). This was a non-linear fixed relationship.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> found that the percentage of current established smokers increased with higher levels of receptivity in two separate cohorts with a six-year follow up. Naming the brand of favourite cigarette advertisement (moderate receptivity) at six-year follow up, versus minimal receptivity at baseline, increased the odds of becoming an established smoker for both a 1993-1999 cohort (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94), as well as a 1996-2002 cohort (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07). Adolescents who had or were willing to use tobacco promotional items (high receptivity) were also more likely to become an established smoker at follow up (1993-1999 cohort, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.94; and 1996-2002 cohort, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.28-2.63).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009a</LINK> found that 34% of ever smokers named the brand of their favourite advertisement at baseline, while only 6% of never smokers were able to name a favourite advertisement. Identifying a favourite advertisement predicted smoking after 1 year in baseline never smokers (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.20), and higher levels of smoking after one year in baseline ever-smokers (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.63).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2010</LINK> collected data on tobacco marketing receptivity at baseline and at four eight-month intervals. Results showed that adolescents having a favourite cigarette advertisement at baseline increased the likelihood of smoking five years later (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.3; P=0.39). It was also found that the proportion of girls who reported a favourite advertisement went up (increased of 10%) following a fashion-themed 'Camel No.9' advertising campaign (targeting younger women) which was launched between the 4th and 5th study follow up. Previous to the campaign, the number of girls reporting a favourite add had been stable across time. No increase was observed for boys during the same time period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2000</LINK> found that owning or being willing to use a personal item bearing a cigarette brand logo at baseline (receptive) was associated with higher smoking uptake at the 18-month follow up. Nearly half (48.7%) of adolescents who were not regular smokers at baseline moved up one or more categories on a smoking index. Controlling for other variables possibly related to smoking uptake, the odds of taking up smoking were higher for adolescents who were receptive compared to those not receptive (OR 1.9, 95% 1.3 to 2.9).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK> reported that naming a brand at baseline was related to trying smoking at four-month follow up, when data from boys and girls were analysed together using step-forward logistic regression (P &lt; 0.025). Having a favourite cigarette advertisement was not predictive of smoking uptake. When boys and girls were analysed separately, neither factor was significant for boys. For girls, however, being able to name a brand was associated with trying smoking (P = 0.02, not controlled for other variables).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK> reported that girls who named one of the two most advertised brands, Benson and Hedges, were at greater risk of taking up smoking one year later than those who named other less advertised brands (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 5.30). Girls who named both Benson and Hedges and Silk Cut were also at greater risk of smoking than girls naming other brands (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.42). Differences were larger and more significant when data were analysed using the group who named no brands as the control comparator. For girls who named Silk Cut alone the difference was not statistically significant against either no brand or less advertised brands groups. Both boys and girls who named brands other than Benson and Hedges and Silk Cut were not at greater risk of smoking at one-year follow up than those who named no brands, although for boys the difference almost reached statistical significance. Boys who named Benson and Hedges, Silk Cut or both were more likely to become smokers than boys who named no brand, but the differences were not statistically significant when compared to boys who named other brands. Results were not controlled for other factors that may influence smoking uptake.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK> found that the more cigarette advertisements adolescents correctly identified at baseline (slides of advertisements with brand names covered) the higher the percentage of smokers (p&lt;0.0001). There was no significant difference in smoking between those who recognized none or one of the brands. Over time, the probability of being a smoker increased with the number of cigarette advertisements identified at baseline; at six-month follow up (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46), 12 months (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.35) and 18 months (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.35).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exposure to Advertising</HEADING>
<P>Findings from five studies found a significant positive association between exposure to cigarette advertising and adolescent smoking. One study found differences in smoking susceptibility and uptake by ethnicity (<LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK>) while <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> found no ethnic differences. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK>) tested the specificity of advertising and reported that only advertisements for cigarettes, versus other consumer goods, predicted smoking initiation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> assessed baseline exposure of adolescents to brand-specific cigarette advertising in magazines. A follow-up survey of smoking behaviour was subsequently conducted in 1997/8. Adolescents' levels of brand-specific advertising exposure in magazines were highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, P = 0.0001). The top three brands of initiation (Marlboro, Newport, and Camel) were among the top four brands in terms of adolescents' exposure to magazine advertising. These brands accounted for 89.0% of initiation and 61.6% of the advertising exposure among the sample. The brands smoked by current smokers were highly correlated with the adolescents' exposure to brand specific advertising in magazines (r = 0.87, P = 0.0002).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2003</LINK> investigated the impact of pro-tobacco media exposure on susceptibility to smoking by ethnicity. For all ethnicities, baseline never-smokers had increased odds of being susceptible to smoking (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.51) and ever smoking (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28) after one year. When results were examined by ethnicity, exposure to tobacco marketing predicted susceptibility (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.75) and ever-smoking (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.33) in white students only. This association was not present for African American or Hispanic students.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK> examined the impact of participants' perceived exposure to pro-tobacco media and susceptibility to smoking after one or two years. Exposure to tobacco marketing on television or at a retail store was associated with being susceptible to smoking after one or two years' follow up (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.23-2.91). These odds almost doubled with exposure to both television and retail store tobacco marketing (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.16 to 5.16). Ethnicity status did not moderate the effects of pro-tobacco media exposure on susceptibility to smoking.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK> examined exposure to cigarette retail advertising by measuring: shopping frequency, estimated cigarette brand impressions per week, and perceived exposure. After 12 months, initiation of smoking was highest for baseline never smokers who visited the most convenience stores at least twice per week as compared to those who visited these stores less than twice per month (29% versus 9%, respectively). Adolescents whose shopping frequency was moderate (0.5-1.9 visits per week) or high (&gt;2 visits per week) had increased odds of smoking at 12 months (Moderate: OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.55, High: OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.97) and 30 months (Moderate: OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to1.41, High: OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.69). High (&gt;260 per week), but not moderate (60-259 per week) exposure to cigarette brand impressions predicted smoking initiation after 12 months (Moderate: OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.89, High: OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.61) and 30 months (Moderate: OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81 to1.79, High: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.37). Perceived exposure to advertising predicted a small increase in the odds of initiating smoking at the 30-month follow up (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22) but this relationship was no longer significant when adjusted for cigarette brand impressions per week.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK> examined the specificity of the association between cigarette advertising and adolescent smoking initiation. The incidence of trying smoking was associated with an increased exposure to cigarette advertisements (10% in the low exposure group, 12% in the medium exposure group, and 19% in the high exposure group). Exposure to advertisements for other consumer goods did not predict smoking initiation. The relative risk of smoking initiation was 1.46 (95% CI 1.08-1.97, P&lt;0.05) times higher in those with high exposure to cigarette advertisements as compared to those with low exposure to cigarette advertisements. Exposure to advertisements for other consumer goods was not associated with an increased risk for smoking initiation.</P>

<P>Results from three studies indicated a relationship between adoption of smoking and approval of advertising, as well as perceived influence of advertising.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK> found that approval of advertising was the fourth most important factor in predicting uptake after age, peer smoking, and sibling smoking. Students who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to become smokers as those who disapproved (adoption rate of 27 per 100 versus 12.1 per 100 respectively). Further, the adoption rate of students who were ambivalent about advertising was 19.3 per 100 (Chi Square = 81.8 p&lt;0.001, not controlled for other variables).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1998</LINK> found that the relative risk of baseline nonsmokers becoming smokers was increased amongst those who accepted tobacco advertising (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.0). The risk was not statistically significant for the subgroup who became weekly or daily smokers during the period (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5 to 3.0). Using logistic regression analysis the odds ratio for becoming smokers did not quite reach statistical significance (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.7).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK> examined perceived influence of advertising and found that among other significant variables, respondents' perceived response to cigarette advertising showed the strongest and most consistent evidence of an effect on the uptake of smoking. A higher influence of advertising was associated with a higher likelihood of becoming a smoker at both one and two-year follow up, adjusting for variables associated with uptake. The strongest effect occurred in the second year. In this study analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls. At the one-year follow up, among girls the adjusted difference in smoking prevalence rates was 8.4% (95% CI 1.2 to 18.1) between those who did and did not perceive advertisements as having some influence; among boys it was 5.3% (95% CI 5.2 to 15.8). At longest follow up (30 months) among girls the difference in prevalence rates was 15% (95% CI 2.1 to 27.9) and among boys it was 15.3% (95% CI 4.0 to 26.6).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-05 15:46:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The results from this review offer evidence that prior exposure to tobacco industry marketing, in the form of advertising and promotion, is associated with future smoking among adolescents. All but one of 19 included longitudinal studies concluded that tobacco industry marketing influences adolescents to start smoking. The caveats to this conclusion were two studies that reported an influence of advertising among girls, but not boys (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK>). Both these studies were conducted in the United Kingdom and used the same measure of advertising awareness. Charlton and colleagues reported that, among girls, naming a brand of cigarette was significantly associated with trying smoking, but having a favourite advertisement was not. Neither factor was statistically significant for boys. In a later study, <LINK REF="STD-While-1996" TYPE="STUDY">While 1996</LINK> and colleagues found that girls who named the most advertised brands were twice as likely to start smoking as girls who named other less advertised brands. Again, no such difference was found for boys. It might be argued that being able to name a cigarette brand need not be due to advertising alone. It is thus worth noting that in the study by While and colleagues girls who named one or both of the most heavily advertised brands were at greater risk of future smoking uptake, whereas girls who named other less advertised brands were not at greater risk.</P>
<P>The one study that found no effect of tobacco industry marketing on initiation of smoking (<LINK REF="STD-Sargent-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sargent 2009b</LINK>) examined receptivity to advertising. Having a favourite advertisement and owning or being willing to own a promotional item predicted higher levels of lifetime smoking; however, in a longitudinal analysis of baseline never smokers, no significant effect on smoking initiation was found. The researchers controlled for a large range of variables including exposure to smoking in movies, which was found to be predictive of smoking initiation.</P>
<P>In addition to demonstrating an association between measures of exposure to advertising and smoking uptake, seven studies reported a dose-response relationship (<LINK REF="STD-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain-McGovern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biener-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2006</LINK>. That is, an adolescent is more likely to initiate smoking as the dose, or amount of, tobacco advertising exposure or receptivity increases. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2007</LINK> found that the odds of initiating smoking increased by 46% for youth who were moderately receptive to advertising and by 84% in youth how were highly receptive to advertising. The presence of a dose-response relationship, in addition to the strength of the association, is needed in order to determine whether a relationship between two variables is causal. <LINK REF="STD-Hanewinkel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanewinkel 2011</LINK> was the first longitudinal study to demonstrate the specificity of tobacco advertising, versus receptivity to advertising in general, which provides a stronger case for the causal relationship between tobacco advertising and youth smoking.</P>
<P>Our decision to limit this review to longitudinal cohort studies requires justification. Other study designs have been used to evaluate the relationship between advertising and tobacco uptake, including cross-sectional studies, time-series and econometric studies. Cross-sectional studies can demonstrate an association between exposure to, awareness of, or attitudes towards advertising, and current smoking behaviour. But since they do not show whether exposure preceded smoking uptake they provide weaker evidence of a causal association. It is probable that adolescents who have begun to smoke will be more aware of advertising than those who have not (<LINK REF="REF-Moschis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moschis 1989</LINK>). The association could also be due to residual confounding with other risk factors for uptake.</P>
<P>Cross-sectional studies do support the evidence from longitudinal studies in that they consistently report correlations between increased 'exposure' and greater likelihood of current smoking. For example, a study used the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Survey of tobacco price sensitivity, behaviour and attitudes among teenagers and young adults, with data from over 17,000 respondents aged 13 to19 (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 2002</LINK>). This demonstrated a strong influence of receptivity to advertising on susceptibility to smoking, experimenting and regular smoking. The association was independent of other risk factors, including exposure to smoking from friends and family. Other cross-sectional studies retrieved by our search strategy are listed in the table of excluded studies. All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zulu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zulu 2009</LINK>) reported an association between smoking status and exposure to advertising, although the strength of the association and the extent to which confounding was corrected for varied. <LINK REF="STD-Zulu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zulu 2009</LINK> used cross-sectional survey data from 2378 youth who took part in the Lusaka (Zambia) Global Youth Tobacco Survey. The authors found a positive association between youth smoking and seeing actors smoking in media but found a negative association between youth smoking and possessing an item with a cigarette brand logo, seeing advertisements on billboards as well as ever being offered a free cigarette by a tobacco sales representative. Many cross-sectional studies also show that although smoking and exposure are correlated, many of the children who have not experimented with smoking recognize advertisements (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Aitken-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Aitken 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFranza-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DiFranza 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Emri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Audrain-McGovern-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Audrain McGovern 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feighery-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feighery 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded time-series studies. In this context, by time-series design we mean studies which relate trends in smoking initiation, or prevalence in the relevant age group, to a measure of advertising exposure, which might be the advertising spend, over an extended period. We excluded them because once again the design is not ideal for demonstrating a temporal relationship, and because there is a greater risk of confounding due to changes in other variables such as the price of cigarettes. The strength of the longitudinal cohort design, by contrast, is that the individuals followed are, to a large extent, exposed to the same external influences. A change in price or policy may change smoking initiation rates, without obscuring differences between the baseline characteristics of subgroups that do and do not change their behaviour. A variety of study designs come under the heading of time-series studies, but generally the advertising exposure variable is assessed at the population level, and smoking is measured as prevalence. But a few studies have addressed initiation; for example, Pierce and Gilpin (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1995</LINK>) used data from a series of surveys to construct age-specific smoking initiation rates for males and females during a series of periods between 1910 and 1977. They used regression analyses to compare initiation rates in different periods and in males and females, and linked this to advertising and promotion of different brands. They concluded that initiation increased in the group targeted, so for example young female initiation increased during the 1930's when Lucky Strike was promoted to women. The same group showed that a decline in smoking initiation rates in 14- to 17-year olds between 1979 and 1984 reversed after this, at the time when tobacco marketing expenditures on coupons, value added items and promotions were increasing (<LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 1997</LINK>). Another study used data from the Monitoring the Future project on rates of daily smoking initiation in different grades (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 1999</LINK>). Observed and expected rates of ninth-grade initiation were compared with advertising and sales promotion expenditures. This showed a significant correlation between year on year increases in sales promotion expenditures and greater than expected initiation rates. This association only became apparent from the early 1980s when promotional expenditures began to dominate tobacco marketing strategy. The association between initiation rates and advertising was not statistically significant, possibly because advertising is expected to have a long-term cumulative effect. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Slater-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 2007</LINK>) which used data from the Monitoring the Future project (waves from 1999 to 2003) assessed the impact of tobacco advertising on smoking uptake, an estimated measure based on current smoking and intentions for future smoking in cross-sectional samples. Regression models revealed that higher levels of point-of-sale advertising was associated with youth smoking initiation.</P>
<P>Econometric studies, which also use time-series data, typically bring together population level and macroeconomic data from multiple sources and use statistical modelling to detect associations. There are methodological problems with using these methods for assessing the effect of tobacco advertising (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK>). Ideally there need to be valid measures of the amount of advertising, taking into account the possible different effects of advertising media, audience variations and advertising content. Values should also be assigned to other variables such as price, smoking restrictions and disposable income. The lagged and durable effects of advertising need to be taken into account. The sources of data are often aggregated national annual figures which have too little variability to detect associations. <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2005</LINK> used data on trends in cigarette sales, advertising expenditure, brand preference and cigarette consumption among youth following the 1987 opening of the cigarette market in Taiwan. Between 1995 and 2000, inflation adjusted advertising expenditures by foreign firms increased fourfold. By 2000, the market share of foreign cigarettes had exceeded domestic brands by three to one among young smokers. The leading domestic brand preferred by youth shifted from the most popular domestic brand to a foreign, widely advertised brand. Most econometric studies of tobacco and advertising were not relevant for this review because they only addressed tobacco consumption, generally from sales data, and did not provide data specifically on young people or smoking initiation. One study used data on self-reported television watching from US survey data between 1966 and 1970. This suggested that more exposure to television advertising increased the probability of being a smoker (<LINK REF="STD-Lewit-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Lewit 1981</LINK>). However there could be confounding, if for example low socioeconomic status disposed teenagers both to smoke and to watch more television (<LINK REF="REF-Smee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smee 1992</LINK>). An unpublished study using Monitoring the Future data and a range of measures for advertising found generally positive effects, some of which were statistically significant for gender subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Chaloupka-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaloupka 1999</LINK>). One study used econometric modelling to investigate brand choice (<LINK REF="STD-Pollay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollay 1996</LINK>). This study found that brand choice among teenagers was correlated with past and present brand advertising. The relationship between brand choice and brand advertising was also stronger amongst teens than among adults.</P>
<P>This review found a consistent relationship between advertising and smoking uptake across 19 of the 19 longitudinal studies included. The exclusion of other, less robust study designs would threaten the validity of our conclusions only if a very strong effect were observed in the opposite direction. In fact other study designs support the conclusion that advertising influences adolescents to begin smoking.</P>
<P>There are several limitations that should be considered in interpreting the results of this review. First, it included 19 studies that are comparatively heterogeneous. We controlled for quality by including only longitudinal studies that followed a cohort of individuals. We did not attempt to quantify the quality of other study characteristics. One of the limitations of observational studies is the relationship between the variables of interest and other confounding factors. Seven of the studies measured and controlled for other variables likely to be associated with smoking uptake. It is impossible to know if all relevant variables were measured and included in the analysis. Second, we focused on mass media advertising and promotion and did not consider other forms of marketing such as event sponsorship, placement in movies, television programs and popular music, thus no conclusions can be drawn regarding tobacco marketing in general. Third, the way in which exposure to advertising and promotion was operationalized varied across studies (e.g., receptivity, influence, awareness). One of the greatest methodological challenges in evaluating evidence on the effect of tobacco advertising on smoking behaviour of adolescents is the measure of exposure to tobacco advertising. We know of no validated instrument that measures tobacco industry marketing exposure reliably. As noted earlier the indirect approach used by <LINK REF="STD-Pucci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucci 1999</LINK> had the advantage of avoiding recall bias by using an index of 'total gross impressions' based on self-reports of magazines read, but magazines are just one course of exposure to advertising. The consistency of the findings using different methods of measuring exposure and of analysis can be interpreted as a strength. Fourth, It has also been pointed out that longitudinal studies assessing advertising and youth smoking fail to address that baseline advertising receptivity or ownership of tobacco paraphernalia may be due to an endogenous, unmeasured characteristic of the individual that is related to smoking initiation (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2010</LINK>). Elimination of this bias would require that advertising exposure be randomised to subjects using an experimental design which is impractical. The vast majority of studies included in this review, controlled for a variety of variables known to or hypothesized to be associated with tobacco use in order to reduce the potential for bias.</P>
<P>The problem of publication bias may also affect the studies identified for inclusion. It is possible that other cohort studies have measured variables related to advertising exposure. If they failed to detect an association with advertising they may not have been published, or were published but did not refer to advertising so failed to be retrieved by our search strategy.</P>
<P>Like public health interventions, industry tobacco marketing activities are very complex. The effects of tobacco industry marketing on adolescents exist in the context of broader society. Even with the application of statistical modelling procedures it is difficult to 'isolate' the effects of advertising and promotion because they are culturally embedded within the adolescent experience and are hard to quantify. Marketing includes many components in addition to conventional advertising, some of which are embedded in other contexts, for example product placement in films. There are many problems with trying to assess the impact of tobacco advertising even on overall consumption, as <LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK> points out. For example, if there is a high level of aggregation of the data on advertising expenditure and consumption, as occurs if annual national figures are used, the loss of variance reduces the likelihood of detecting an effect (<LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK>). Studies of the impact of advertising bans can also be used as an indirect method of assessing the effect of advertising on consumption. The impact of bans can be assessed by comparing countries or geographic areas with and without advertising restrictions, or by comparing levels of consumption pre- and post-ban. A review of studies of the effect of advertising restrictions (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saffer 2000</LINK>) concluded that comprehensive advertising bans can reduce tobacco consumption, but does not attempt to consider smoking prevalence. Detecting an effect of a ban on smoking uptake rates is difficult because analysis would need to take into account the gradual process of smoking initiation. Rimpela and colleagues have highlighted the problems of relating adolescent smoking prevalence to advertising bans in Norway and Finland. In Norway the introduction of a ban did appear to reduce the prevalence of young smokers, particularly females (<LINK REF="STD-Rimpela-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rimpela 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gilpin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilpin 2004</LINK> examined receptivity to tobacco advertising among adolescents before and after California&#8217;s 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, which placed strong restrictions on advertising. There was a 37% increase in the percentage of California young adolescents who did not name a brand of a favourite cigarette advertisement in 2002 compared to 1999. In 2000, cigarette advertising was banned from all Brazilian media. <LINK REF="STD-Galduroz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Galduroz 2007</LINK>used cross-sectional survey data collected in 1997 and 2004 to assess adolescent tobacco use, in 10 Brazilian capitals, before and after the advertising ban. In 1997, 32.7% of adolescents had reported using tobacco, by 2004 it had decreased to 25.02%. A downward trend was observed in all but two capitals.</P>
<P>This review was guided by a logic model in which exposure to tobacco industry advertising and promotion increases awareness of cigarettes and engenders positive attitudes that lead to smoking. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion and other variables that may mediate between exposure and behaviour, such as brand awareness, receptivity, and positive attitudes towards advertising and promotion would predict future smoking behaviour. The evidence from our review of published longitudinal studies, as well as other reviews that have included cross-sectional studies (<LINK REF="REF-Biener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biener 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2003</LINK>), support the hypothesis that tobacco advertising and promotion influence adolescents to smoke cigarettes.<BR/>In summary, there is substantial evidence that exposure to tobacco advertising is associated with adolescent smoking:<BR/>(1) eighteen of the 19 longitudinal cohort studies showed a positive, consistent, and specific relationship;<BR/>(2) the association is considered strong and a temporally correct dose-gradient has been demonstrated between naming advertising brands and being willing to use a promotional item, and smoking uptake;<BR/>(3) it is theoretically plausible that exposure to advertising increases smoking uptake.</P>

<P>Evaluation of tobacco industry marketing is a methodologically challenging area, yet rigorous evaluation is still needed. More longitudinal research should be conducted that assesses the impact of a variety of marketing approaches in a wider range of cultural and geographic settings. Emphasis should be placed on developing measures of advertising exposure, as well as more in-depth exploration of gender differences. Effectiveness studies demonstrating the impact of advertising bans would contribute to what is known in this area. It is important that survey research in these areas account for variables known to predict smoking. More detailed descriptions of contextual factors should be incorporated into published studies.</P>

Selection criteria for choosing cigarette advertisements were: (1) to have been on billboards within a radius of 500m of the schools at some time during the 3 months preceding the study, and (2) to be focused on young people (iconic and/or textual message). Experts selected, by consensus, the three advertisements with messages that were most focused on young people. Slides of these advertisements, with brand names covered, were shown to students. Students were asked to write the brand name, if recognized. An advertisement was assumed to be recognized when the brand was identified. Range of responses was 0, 1, 2, or 3 brand names identified and children were assigned to a group according to their reply, and remained in that group until the end of the study.</P>

<P>Cohort Study</P>
<P>Baseline: Unknown (prior to 2005)</P>
<P>Follow-up: 12 and 24 months</P>
<P>Site: Los Angeles metropolitan area, USA</P>
<P>Research Question: (1) to what extent does exposure to tobacco media affect susceptibility to smoking over time? (2) Does anti-tobacco media exposure interact with pro-tobacco media exposure in relationship to smoking susceptibility in adolescents? (3) Does ethnicity or acculturation affect the relationship between tobacco-related media exposure and intention to smoke?</P>
<P>Analysis: Logistic regression models using hierarchical generalized linear models (to cluster students within classrooms, within schools) with gender, ethnicity, acculturation status, pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media exposure, and experimental conditions as covariates to predict smoking susceptibility by later grades. Interaction and moderation effects of pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on ethnicity, acculturation and immigration status were tested using Chi-square analysis.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-08-11 20:18:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Allison ">
<P>3,190 6th grade students at baseline; 2,822 7th grade students at year 1; and 2,561 8th grade students at year 3. Total of 2,046 student with complete data at each follow-up and were non-susceptible non-smokers at baseline.</P>
<P>Participants were from 24 schools with grades 6-8, located in Southern California with student population comprised of at least 25% Hispanic or at least 25% Asian American.</P>
<P>Survey Method: self-reported, pencil-and-paper surveys administered in classrooms.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-26 13:06:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Pro-tobacco media exposure was measured at baseline with two items: " when you watch TV, how often do you see people smoking" and "When you go to a small market, convenience store (like 7/11) or gas station mini-mart (like AM/PM), how often do you see advertisements for cigarettes?" Response options were rated on a 6-point scale (1= Alot to 4= Never, plus 5= I never watch TV/go to a small market, store or mini-mart, and 6= I don't know) Pro-tobacco media exposure was then re-coded into four categories: 0 = non-exposure to both TV smoking and market advertising; 1= exposure to either TV smoking or market advertising; 2= exposure to both TV smoking and market advertising; and 3= other (for those who answered options 5, 6 or missing).</P>
<P>Anti-tobacco media exposure was assessed at baseline with the question: In the last month, how many TV commercials have you seen about NOT smoking? Responses were rated on a 4-point scale (1=none to 4= a lot). The scores for anti-tobacco exposures were then re-coded into exposure versus non-exposure to TV commercials.</P>
<P>Acculturation was measured using the eight-item Acculturation, Habits, and Interests Multicultural Scale for Adolescents (AHIMSA) to assess one of four acculturation statuses. The questions such as "I am most comfortable being with people from..." and "The holidays I celebrate are from..." had four response options: a) The United States (assimilation orientations); b) The country my family is from (separation orientations); c) both (integration orientation); and d) Neither (marginalization orientation). Each student was assigned to one of the four orientation categories based on his/her most commonly selected response.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-08-08 22:53:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Allison ">
<P>Baseline smoking status was classified by two categories, Non-susceptible non-smokers and all others (including susceptible non-smokers and smokers). Smoking susceptibility was captured using the question "At any time in the next year (12months), do you think you will smoke a cigarette?" Students responding "No, definitely not" out of a four-point scale were coded as non-susceptible non-smokers, all other responses (Maybe no, Maybe yes, and Yes definitely) were coded as susceptible non-smokers)</P>

<P>For all ethnicities, baseline never smokers had increased odds of being susceptible to smoking (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.51) and ever smoking (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28) after 1 year. When results were examined by ethnicity, exposure to tobacco marketing predicted susceptibility (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.75) and ever smoking (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.33) in white students only.

<P>After 12 months, initiation of smoking was highest for baseline never smokers who visited the most convenience stores at least twice per week as compared to those who visited these stores less than twice per month (29% versus 9%, respectively). Adolescents whose shopping frequency was moderate (0.5-1.9 visits per week) or high (&gt;2 visits per week) had increased odds of smoking at 12 months (Moderate: OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.55, High: OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.97) and 30 months (Moderate: OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to1.41, High: OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.69). High (&gt;260 per week), but not moderate (60-259 per week) exposure to cigarette brand impressions predicted smoking initiation after 12 months (Moderate: OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.89, High: OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.61) and 30 months (Moderate: OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81 to1.79, High: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.37). Perceived exposure to advertising predicted a small increase in the odds of initiating smoking at the 30 month follow up (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22) but this relationship was no longer significant when adjusted for cigarette brand impressions per week.</P>
