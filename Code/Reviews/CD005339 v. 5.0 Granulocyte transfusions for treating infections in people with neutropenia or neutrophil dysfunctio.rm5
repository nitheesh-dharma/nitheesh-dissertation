<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-01-12 15:30:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">Transfusions of white blood cells to treat infections in people with low white blood cell counts or white blood cells that do not function properly</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:08:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We evaluated the evidence about whether white blood cell transfusions (also called granulocyte transfusions) given to treat infections are safe and reduce the risk of death or severe outcomes due to infection. Our target population was people with a very low white count (neutropenia) or white cells that did not function properly (neutrophil dysfunction).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Functioning white blood cells are important for fighting life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. For many years some hospital physicians have given white blood cell transfusions to people with infections who have a low white blood count. The demand for white blood cells for transfusion has shown a steady increase since the 1990s mainly as a result of the introduction of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which if given to donors, leads to increased white blood cell numbers in the donor's blood and the collection of a larger dose of white blood cells than was previously possible.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to February 2016. In this update we identified 10 completed trials that compared giving white blood cell transfusions to treat infection compared to not giving white blood cells to treat infection. One additional trial has not yet been completed. The 10 trials containing a total of 587 participants were conducted between 1975 and 2015. The studies differed in the type of infections they included. Data from three trials were not included in the analyses because participants were included within the trial more than once. Six trials included both children and adults, but results were not reported separately for children and adults. The two newest trials gave G-CSF to donors, both were stopped early due to lack of recruitment. Six studies reported their funding sources and all were funded by governments or charities.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Giving white blood cell transfusions to treat infection may not affect the risk of death or the number of people who recover from an infection.</P>
<P>It is unknown whether white blood cell transfusions increase the risk of having a serious adverse event.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported whether white blood cell transfusions reduced the number of days participants were on therapeutic antibiotics, or whether white blood cell transfusions had an effect on participants' quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence for most of the findings are of low or very low quality. This was because the total number of participants included in this review was too small to detect a difference in this review's primary outcome. We calculated that a study would need at least 2748 participants to be able to detect a decrease in the risk of death from 35 people out of 100 to 30 people out of 100 (five additional lives saved per 100 people treated). Also participants and their doctors were likely to know which study arm they had been allocated to in all of the studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or treatment-related neutropenia. Transfusions of granulocytes have a long history of usage in clinical practice to support and treat severe infection in high-risk groups of patients with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction. However, there is considerable current variability in therapeutic granulocyte transfusion practice, and uncertainty about the beneficial effect of transfusions given as an adjunct to antibiotics on mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-11-03 15:27:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of granulocyte transfusions compared to no granulocyte transfusions as adjuncts to antimicrobials for treating infections in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function aimed at reducing mortality and other adverse outcomes related to infection.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-27 17:17:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>We identified 10 trials that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 587 participants. We also identified another ongoing trial. These trials were conducted between 1975 and 2015. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. The studies differed in the type of infections they included. Six studies included both children and adults, however data were not reported separately for children and adults. The two newest studies gave granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to donors; both were stopped early due to lack of recruitment. Three studies re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed.</P>
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcomes being imprecise.</P>
<P>There may be no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 321 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). There were no differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (&lt; 1 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> per day versus &#8805; 1 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>per day) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.39). There was a difference in all-cause mortality between the studies based on the age of the study (published before 2000 versus published 2000 or later) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.03). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the newest study (one study; 111 participants; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.73, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There may be a reduction in all-cause mortality in participants receiving granulocyte transfusions compared to those that did not in studies published before the year 2000 (five studies; 210 participants; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There may be no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infection between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (five studies; 286 participants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference in pulmonary serious adverse events (1 study; 24 participants; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.88; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>None of the studies reported number of days on therapeutic antibiotics, number of adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment, or quality of life.</P>

<P>In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether granulocyte transfusions affect all-cause mortality.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:18:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:18:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Functioning white blood cells (WBCs) are a vital component of the defence system against infection in humans. There are a variety of different WBCs that work together and perform complementary roles. Granulocytes are WBCs that contain granules that are visible when viewed through a light microscope. Neutrophils, a subtype of granulocytes are the most numerous circulating WBCs in healthy adults. Granulocytes in general, and neutrophils in particular, are crucial in protecting against bacterial and fungal infection. A persisting reduction in neutrophil numbers is called neutropenia, the severity of which has been classified by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>): when the peripheral blood count is below a level of 0.5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/litre there is an increased risk of severe infection (the normal neutrophil count ranges from 2 to 7.5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/litre in adults). Neutropenia usually occurs as a result of impaired production of neutrophils and other blood cells in the bone marrow. Diseases infiltrating the bone marrow such as leukaemias, or drugs that are toxic to the bone marrow such as chemotherapy, are typical reversible causes of neutropenia. Even if their number of neutrophils is normal, people may suffer from a similar inability to fight infections adequately if there is an impairment in the function of their neutrophils. Some people are born with such disorders, which may either be suspected from their family history or demonstrated by laboratory testing (<LINK REF="REF-Kuijpers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuijpers 1999</LINK>) e.g. chronic granulomatous disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Despite the use of specific and appropriate antibiotic and antifungal drugs, infection in people with neutropenia is associated with hospital admission, organ damage, and a significant number of deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legrand-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legrand 2012</LINK>). The infusion of granulocytes to prevent or treat infection in high-risk patients has been part of clinical practice for over 40 years.</P>
<P>Granulocyte transfusion therapy has undergone several paradigm shifts. There was some preliminary evidence that granulocyte transfusions were effective in the context of clinical studies conducted with the prevailing standards of clinical care 30 to 40 years ago, including the trials analysed in this review. However, following this initial enthusiasm, concerns were raised about efficacy at the doses collected. More recent studies have suggested that the efficacy of granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic patients may be proportional to the dose of granulocytes transfused.</P>
<P>Uncertainty arising from the age of this clinical research is also compounded by problems of clinical diversity, methodological weaknesses and heterogeneity, all described in this review (see below). In addition, none of these earlier studies reported on quality control measures operating for blood components, including granulocytes, and again, it is expected that current blood products would be manufactured to a higher and more consistent standard.</P>
<P>In 1961, granulocytes were selectively collected from the blood of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had raised levels of leukaemic WBCs, including neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Freireich-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freireich 1964</LINK>). Apheresis (from the Greek 'to take away') was later developed and used for increased efficiency; this technique removes specific blood cells or fluid from the donor or patient whilst the cells or fluid that do not need to be removed are returned to the donor. Although apheresis involves equipment, it does allow selective collection of a larger dose of granulocytes than would be found in whole blood, with the added advantage for the donor of minimal red cell loss. In the early 1960s, granulocytes collected in this way were transfused into people with severe neutropenia that was not responsive to antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Freireich-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freireich 1964</LINK>). There are a number of different methods for collecting granulocytes for transfusion in humans.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unstimulated apheresis collection of granulocytes</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of technical problems that make it difficult to collect consistently adequate granulocyte doses for transfusion. Granulocytes are difficult to separate from other blood cells, even if this has been facilitated by commercially available long-chain starch solutions (sedimenting agents) such as hetastarch and pentastarch. Also, normal donors do not have very high levels of circulating granulocytes in the peripheral blood, and as a result are able only to donate sufficient doses of granulocytes for very small children. Doses of less than 1 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> granulocytes per m<SUP>2</SUP> of body surface area are not associated with either a significant rise in the recipient's neutrophil count or a clinical response to established infection (<LINK REF="REF-Engelfriet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelfriet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stimulated apheresis collection of granulocytes</HEADING>
<P>More recently, there has been a further resurgence of interest in granulocyte transfusions, reflecting recognition that higher doses of granulocytes could be collected for transfusion, by priming donors with steroids or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or both, to increase the circulating white cell count prior to apheresis (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2000</LINK>). In the early 1990s growth factors that stimulate the bone marrow to produce more WBCs (particularly granulocytes) became available for therapeutic use (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engelfriet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelfriet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1995</LINK>). These drugs allowed high peripheral blood white cell counts to be achieved in healthy donors. The most commonly used growth factor is G-CSF. Steroids can also increase the white cell count, by both increasing marrow release of granulocytes and decreasing efflux from peripheral blood, but steroids alone are not as effective as G-CSF. The use of a single injection of G-CSF alone or combined with a single oral dose of steroids has enabled the collection of significantly greater yields of granulocytes by apheresis. Using this method, adequate doses of granulocytes can be produced for larger children and adults. However, the general clinical utility of transfusion therapy has also been compromised logistically by the inability to store granulocyte products in a manner which preserves much of their function (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2003</LINK>). These developments have occurred in conjunction with advances in the overall standards of supportive care given to people undergoing treatment for haematological malignancies and stem cell transplantation, including the diagnostic strategies for infection and the therapeutic armamentarium of anti-microbial drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Dellinger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellinger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exposure of a healthy volunteer donor to any form of medication with potential side effects does, however, present ethical and safety issues. Most side effects related to G-CSF are short term (<LINK REF="REF-Bux-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bux 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-la-Rubia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Rubia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_lig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hölig 2013</LINK>). Repeated doses of G-CSF have been reported to cause thrombosis, possibly as a result of the increased level of white cells in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_lig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hölig 2013</LINK>). Cases of splenic rupture following repeated doses of G-CSF have been reported among the more severe adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_lig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hölig 2013</LINK>). Any drug can also cause allergic type reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>). The bone marrow expansion that occurs as a result of G-CSF stimulation commonly leads to bone pain and flu-like symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_lig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hölig 2013</LINK>). Theoretical concerns regarding the long-term effects of G-CSF on the donor's bone marrow cells remain, although there is increasing evidence that prolonged repeated administration of G-CSF to children and adults as therapy does not increase their risk of bone marrow disorders (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Rubia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Rubia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_lig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hölig 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the potential risks of G-CSF, in England G-CSF cannot be administered to healthy donors who are not giving a directed granulocyte donation. A small number of donations are also collected from relatives and friends of patients following the administration of G-CSF and the steroid dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Hubel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubel 2002</LINK>).</P>

These provide granulocyte doses at least comparable to the higher doses recorded in the randomised trials identified in this review. The risks of clinical sequelae due to alloimmunisation after multiple-donor rather than single-donor granulocyte transfusions need to be assessed fully. In one small study alloimmunisation occurred in 10% (3/30) of participants receiving granulocytes in additive solution and plasma (GASP) (<LINK REF="REF-Massey-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 2012</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:11:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Clinical experience and data from animal studies suggest that control of infection in neutropenic patients requires recovery of bone marrow neutrophil production (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1976</LINK>). The first documented attempt to reverse neutropenia using granulocyte transfusions was during the 1930s (<LINK REF="REF-Strumia-1934" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strumia 1934</LINK>). Twenty years later, Brecher and colleagues gave granulocyte transfusions to neutropenic dogs, in which they showed that the transfused cells migrated to the areas of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Brecher-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brecher 1953</LINK>). There is an obvious rationale for this intervention, in that the major risk factor for severe infection in such patients is neutropenia: transfusions of granulocytes is then a logical way of correcting the deficit of granulocytes.</P>
<P>Adverse events such as febrile reactions, occasional severe pulmonary complications with hypoxia and hypotension, and HLA (human leucocyte antigen) alloimmunisation (immune-mediated mechanisms potentially complicating other transfusions) are well recognised complications of granulocyte transfusions.</P>
<P>Although there is limited evidence from laboratory testing that donated granulocytes are functional (<LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2008</LINK>), published controlled trials have reported very conflicting results of clinical effect. A number of these issues have been raised in previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kadri-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadri 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A final consideration for any new trials of granulocyte transfusion must be a better understanding of methods to preserve functional activity of granulocytes after collection, since the current utility of granulocyte transfusion therapy is also limited by concerns about storage and loss of function (<LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:11:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction. We are uncertain whether granulocyte transfusions as part of a strategy to treat infection in neutropenic people are more effective at treating infections than antibiotic or antifungal agents alone. If effective, we are uncertain of the harms associated with granulocyte transfusions. Previous Cochrane reviews have been performed with specific reference to neonatal practice and prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Estcourt-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estcourt 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pammi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pammi 2011</LINK>). This systematic review would therefore complement the previous Cochrane reviews.

<P>The original systematic review search (conducted May 2003) identified 59 studies which appeared potentially relevant on the basis of the their full text or abstract. One review author performed the initial screening of abstracts. Two reviewers (EM, SS) independently assessed the 59 full-text articles for inclusion or exclusion on the basis of the full text of abstract or paper using the stated criteria.</P>
<P>The updated search (conducted 11 February 2016) identified a total of 3173 potentially relevant records. There were 2108 records after duplicates were removed. Any two out of four reviewers (LE, CD, PB, SS) excluded 2086 records on the basis of the abstract.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In total, 587 participants were randomised, of these 471 were included in the analyses.</P>
<P>The study populations varied between the 10 trials. No trials enrolled patients with congenital disorders of neutrophil function or production. In all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>), the majority of enrolled participants had acute myeloid leukaemia. The enrolled population in <LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK> was predominantly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Six studies included children (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK>). However, the number of children included in these studies was small because only one study had a median or mean age of study participants below 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK> median 15 years granulocyte transfusion group; 18 years control group). Only one study reported whether the participant's haematological disease was relapsed or refractory (<LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK> 13/48 participants granulocyte transfusion group; 11/47 participants control group). Four studies reported the type of treatment the participants were receiving for their haematological malignancy (<LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>). Two studies included participants receiving chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>), two studies included participants receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) or chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Method of collection of granulocytes</HEADING>
<P>The method of procurement of granulocytes varied between trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Granulocytes were collected by filtration leukapheresis in three studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Alavi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>), by discontinuous flow centrifugation in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK>), and by continuous flow centrifugation in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>). The method was not defined in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 1983</LINK>). Filtration leukapheresis is rarely used now, as despite high yields there are concerns about toxicity to both the donor and recipient, in addition to evidence of poor increments and functionality of the transfused granulocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pre-medication of donors</HEADING>

Eight studies were conducted prior to licensing of G-CSF by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 and therefore it is very unlikely that donors in these studies received G-CSF (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">All-cause mortality up to 30 days (six studies, 321 participants)</HEADING>
<P>Of the seven studies eligible for quantitative analysis, six studies reported information on overall mortality/survival (<LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK>) or data could be extracted from Kaplan Mieier curves (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>). Five studies reported mortality at 20 to 22 days (<LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>). The data in <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1982a</LINK> were presented as survival/mortality at five days and undefined overall time points, and not at an equivalent time point between 20 to 22 days after randomisation.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis showed no sub-group differences between the data at five days and 20 to 22 days (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.23, df = 1 (P = 0.63), I² = 0%). The overall result for all six studies showed no difference in all-cause mortality up to 30 days in the participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.04, 321 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>It should be noted that mortality rates for the control group varied considerably between studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK> trial, 20-day mortality figures (after randomisation) in the control group were reported as 74% (14/19) whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK> they were 8% (1/12). Part of the reason for this significant variation will be because of the small numbers involved in the included studies and the different inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Overall, in all six trials the mortality was 35%. We calculated that 2748 participants are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, a decrease in all-cause mortality from 35% in the control group to 30% in the experimental group. We considered preventing five deaths per 100 people treated with granulocyte transfusions was a clinically significant difference. There are insufficient participants within the included trials (324 participants) to detect a difference in all-cause mortality.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical reversal of concurrent infection (five studies, 286 participants)</HEADING>
<P>Of the seven studies eligible for quantitative analysis, five studies reported information on clinical reversal of concurrent infections (<LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>). The definitions of what constituted a clinical reversal of concurrent infection differed between studies (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>, the response to infection with antimicrobials alone was 43% (21/49). We calculated that 642 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in recovery from the infection from 43% in the control group to 54% in the experimental group (25% increase in recovery from infection). There are insufficient participants within the included trials (286 participants) to detect a difference in reversal of concurrent infections. We chose a 25% increase in recovery from infection because we felt this was a clinically significant difference that would lead to a change in practice if there were no significant side effects.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-27 17:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>This Cochrane review aimed to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions. This review should be read in conjunction with another review undertaken to evaluate the randomised trial evidence for the use of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Estcourt-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estcourt 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified 10 completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and one additional ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-DRKS00000218" TYPE="STUDY">DRKS00000218</LINK>). Ten trials were included in this review containing a total of 587 participants. None of the trials enrolled people with neutrophil dysfunction. Three studies re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in all-cause mortality between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 321 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04).</P>
<P>Unlike the previous version of this review, we found that there were no differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (&lt; 1 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> per day versus &#8805; 1 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>per day) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.39). We did find that there was a difference between the studies based on the age of the study (published before 2000 versus published 2000 or later) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.03). We found that there was no difference in all-cause mortality between participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the newest study (one study; 111 participants; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.73). The newest study was also the only study in the meta-analysis that gave granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to donors. We noted that there may be a reduction in all-cause mortality in participants receiving granulocyte transfusions compared to those that did not in studies published before the year 2000 (five studies; 210 participants; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We found that there may be no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infections between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (five studies; 286 participants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference in pulmonary serious adverse events between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (one study; 24 participants; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.88).</P>
<P>None of the studies reported number of days on therapeutic antibiotics, number of adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment, or quality of life.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:17:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>This review provides the most up to date assessment of the effectiveness and safety of a therapeutic granulocyte transfusion policy compared with not administering granulocyte transfusions. This updated review identified two additional completed trials (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>) and one ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-DRKS00000218" TYPE="STUDY">DRKS00000218</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this review should not be interpreted without taking into consideration the impact of the following factors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>None of the trials in this review specifically evaluated patients with congenital disorders of neutrophil function or production, although many clinicians might consider this an accepted practice to manage severe or refractory infections in this group of patients.</LI>
<LI>The one ongoing study (expected recruitment 100 participants) will be too small to provide sufficient additional data for this review&#8217;s primary outcome. For example, if we assumed that the risk of death was 35 out of 100 people with neutropenia who had a serious infection treated with antibiotics alone and that the risk of death decreased to 30 out of 100 people when they received therapeutic granulocyte transfusions as well as antibiotics, we would need to design a study with at least 2748 participants to detect this difference with 80% power and 5% significance (3680 participants required to detect a difference with 90% power) (calculated using a power calculator at http://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-superiority/).</LI>
<LI>None of the studies assessed the use of granulocytes derived from whole blood donations (<LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2008</LINK>). This component has been assessed in a small safety study (<LINK REF="REF-Massey-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 2012</LINK>). The process of obtaining granulocyte collections from directed G-CSF and/ or steroid-stimulated donors who are &#8217;family and friends&#8217; of patients or unrelated donors involves multiple steps. It is important that family and &#8217;friends&#8217; of patients are given time and an adequate explanation of the small risks to which they are exposed by both taking specific drugs (steroids or G-CSF, or both) to mobilise granulocytes into the peripheral blood and by undergoing an apheresis procedure. To date, most of these risks have been theoretical or weak associations only but posterior capsular cataracts, splenic rupture and venous thrombosis have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghodsi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghodsi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>). There are also a number of potentially important constraints that can limit provision of apheresis products on a regular and timely basis; e.g. hospitals in Europe managing granulocyte collections by apheresis now have a requirement for meeting &#8217;blood establishment status&#8217; according to EU legislation.</LI>
<LI>Only two of the studies gave G-CSF to the granulocyte donors (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>), both studies were stopped early due to lack of recruitment.</LI>
<LI>The effect of G-CSF on donors was not reported and other side effects for granulocyte donors was only reported for two studies (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The studies included in this review range over a 40-year period (1975 to 2015) during which chemotherapy protocols, predicted survival rates, supportive care, including antibiotics and anti-fungal medication, have changed substantially. Newer less toxic anti-fungal drug options are now available.</LI>
<LI>Data from three of the included studies could not be included in the meta-analysis due to re-randomisation of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The types of infection included within the trials varied (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In two studies participants had to have positive microbiological cultures (<LINK REF="STD-Herzig-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzig 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogler-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vogler 1977</LINK>). Seven studies permitted a 'possibility' of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Alavi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Alavi 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scali-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scali 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2008a</LINK>), the exact definition of which varied between the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Bow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bow 1984</LINK> people with a definite infection were excluded from the randomised part of the study.</LI>

</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-27 17:16:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This was due to many of the outcome estimates being imprecise and many of the studies being at high risk of bias. Although most studies were at an unclear risk of bias due to blinding due to lack of information it is likely that these were all unblinded studies due to the difficultly in blinding participants and physicians to the intervention.</P>
<P>One outcome was graded <I>low-quality evidence</I> because of a serious risk of imprecision and a serious risk of bias.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Clinical reversal of concurrent infections</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two outcomes were considered <I>very low-quality evidence</I> because of a very serious risk of imprecision, a serious risk of bias, and a serious risk of inconsistency.</P>
<UL>
<LI>All-cause mortality</LI>
<LI>Number of serious adverse events</LI>
</UL>
<P>The reason for the imprecision is because of the small number of participants within the trials and the low number of events. The reason for inconsistency for all-cause mortality is because the effect of granulocyte transfusions appears to differ between newer and older studies.</P>
<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for visual representations of the assessments of risk of bias across all studies and for each item within the individual studies.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-06 18:07:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge, our review process is free from bias. We conducted a comprehensive search, searching data sources (including multiple databases, and clinical trial registries) to ensure that all relevant trials would be captured. The relevance of each paper identified was carefully assessed and all screening and data extractions were performed in duplicate. There were no restrictions on the language in which the paper was originally published. We prespecified all outcomes and subgroups prior to analysis. There were insufficient numbers of included studies within the meta-analyses for us to use a funnel plot to examine the risk of publication bias.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:17:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>We know of no other recent systematic reviews on the use of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction. The last review on this subject was the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>). This review no longer finds an overall benefit of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions on all-cause mortality; this differs from the previous version of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:17:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the use of granulocyte transfusion therapy in patients with neutropenia and severe infection to reduce mortality. None of the trials in this review specifically evaluated patients with congenital disorders of neutrophil function or production, although many clinicians might consider this as accepted practice to manage severe infection. None of the studies in this review assessed the use of granulocytes derived from whole blood donations. In keeping with the conclusions from the systematic review of the use of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions, the use of granulocyte transfusions should still be regarded as investigational and should ideally be conducted in the context of ongoing prospective trials designed to answer the question of effectiveness.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-26 15:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Contemporary well-designed prospective trials of sufficient power are required to evaluate the efficacy of granulocyte transfusions, in order to establish definitively whether it has clinical benefit or not with regards to reduction in mortality. The one ongoing trial is too small (100 participants) to be able to answer this review's primary outcome.</P>
<P>Side effects need to be evaluated not only for the transfused recipient but also with respect to donors.</P>

<P>For continuous outcomes we planned to record the mean and standard deviations, and total number of participants in both the treatment and control groups.

<B>Other:</B> The study was closed prematurely due to a dramatic decrease in recruitment rate from 15 on 2001 to 2 in 2005. The predicted sample size based on survival to 28 days was 160 participants (80 in each study arm) taking into consideration a 10% drop-out proportion). This ws based on the assumption that the estimated survival to 28 days was 60% in the control arm and 80% in the granulocyte transfusion arm.</P>

For subjects alive at Day 42, the panel also determined whether or not the subject&#8217;s infection resolved or improved.
