<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for domestic wandering in people with dementia due to lack of trials</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>No randomised controlled trials were found that proved or disproved the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention or management of wandering in the domestic setting. Trials of music therapy, bright light therapy, reality orientation, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and therapeutic touch have been carried out with participants in institutional settings. This review discusses these interventions in the light of their relevance to the domestic setting. Trials of non-pharmacological interventions in the domestic setting are urgently needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting, but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting. The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-07 14:30:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Wandering by people with dementia can be problematic. Wandering away from home places people with dementia at risk of injury (falls and fractures), may lead to weight loss, accelerated decline of language skills, victimization and premature mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Algase-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algase 2005</LINK>) and is often worrying, time-consuming and exhausting for carers (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Miyamoto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyamoto 2002</LINK>). <BR/>Wandering may precipitate institutionalisation or restriction of the autonomy of people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Althus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althus 2000</LINK>). On the other hand, wandering promotes circulation and oxygenation, is a form of exercise and can be an indicator of good physical health (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2003</LINK>). Within a safe environment wandering could be beneficial; the aim should be to provide a safe level of wandering without a risk of injury by wandering away from the premise (<LINK REF="REF-Coltharp-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coltharp 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess. <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1999</LINK>, in a US study of community-residing persons with dementia, found that wandering behaviour occurred in 17.4% of participants. <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-Mansfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen Mansfield 1986</LINK> reports a figure of 38% in people with dementia. <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1994</LINK> reports 63% in community dwellers with dementia in the UK while the prevalence of wandering among patients with Alzheimer's disease living in the community in France was 12.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Rolland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland 2003</LINK>). A study in 53 Alzheimer's disease Special Care Units in the States reports 6.5% wandering among residents (although the proportion of residents exhibiting this behaviour varied from 1% in some units to 38% in one unit) (<LINK REF="REF-Sloane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloane 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Wandering is not a static or simple behaviour. For example, one longitudinal study of behaviour of people with dementia in the domestic setting (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1994</LINK>) found that over the ten year period of the study over two-thirds of patients were affected by some form of abnormal walking at some stage, but different patients were affected by different forms of the symptom at different stages of the disease. Changes in wandering behaviour were not generally related to gender, age, or time since onset of dementia. Onset of different types of wandering behaviour showed some relationship with cognitive state. Various forms of increased walking first appeared during moderate dementia, each type typically persisting for 1 to 2 years. Late dementia was characterized by decreased walking and mobility. At the earlier stages of the disease some people in this study 'pottered' but the majority were 'checking and trailing'; in the later stages of the disease 'checking and trailing' tended to give way to aimless hyperactivity and restless legs. This would suggest that the wandering has more to do with a restless urge to keep moving than with a need for reassurance. And in such cases the disorder may be alleviated by pharmaceutical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 1994a</LINK>). <BR/>Subjects who got lost were more likely to become permanently resident in institutions (odds ratio = 7.3; 95% confidence interval: 3.0 to 17.8). Patients who performed better on a behavioral test of topographical memory were less likely to get lost over the subsequent 5 years (negative predictive value: 90%). The authors concluded that the risk of patients with dementia getting lost is substantial and requires frequent intervention by caregivers and that this risk is a major reason for institutionalization (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 1998b</LINK>)</P>
<P>Three major approaches to the causes of wandering can be identified: biomedical (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Rolland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland 2005</LINK>), psychosocial and person-environment interaction perspectives (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Yao-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2006</LINK>). However, the aetiology of wandering, the reason why people wander, remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2003</LINK>) and many studies highlight the unpredictable and varied nature of unattended wandering (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2001</LINK>). We lack an understanding of what causes wandering and how combinations of these perspectives lead to particular types of wandering that are clinically noticeable (<LINK REF="REF-Algase-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algase 2005</LINK>). The same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals. This makes it hard to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and we are unlikely to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach (<LINK REF="REF-Kolanowski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolanowski 2001</LINK>). Algase (<LINK REF="REF-Algase-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algase 2005</LINK>) suggests that the chance of success in this trial and error process can be markedly enhanced through close observation of the wanderer's behaviour and careful interviewing of caregivers. Family can be asked to keep a behaviour log that documents the time, location and circumstances surrounding wandering episodes. Sometimes, just this process of keeping a log will give the caregiver insight into what makes the person with dementia wander; such a log can also guide the clinician to the discovery of a promising approach. Algase makes the point that "approaches aimed at mitigating the cause(s) will be more effective than approaches aimed at managing the symptoms or at preventing its consequences" (<LINK REF="REF-Algase-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algase 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review did not find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological interventions that specifically studied the prevention or reduction of wandering in the domestic setting. </P>
<P>RCTs of interventions aimed at behavioural difficulties in general in people with dementia in the domestic setting do exist (for example <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorgrimsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorgrimsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisniewski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisniewski 2003</LINK>) but none of these collected data on wandering as an outcome measure and so we cannot use them in this review. </P>
<P>A number of studies exist of wandering in the institutional setting as opposed to the domestic setting and it would seem useful to review briefly some of the evidence here to see what interventions are used and what we can learn. We will not discuss or comment on the validity of the methodology used in the trials reported below nor on the conclusions drawn from them: the place for that is a future Cochrane review of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the institutional setting.</P>
<P>Interventions aimed at the prevention and reduction of wandering can be put in the following categories:<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>
<B>
<U>Exercise and walking therapies</U>
</B>
<B>

<B>
<I>Walker's group</I>
</B>
<B>:</B> <LINK REF="REF-Cott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cott 2002</LINK> describes a randomised trial in an institutional setting with three groups: walk-and-talk group, talk-only group and no intervention group. Residents who received the walk-and-talk intervention did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in ambulation measured posttest when compared with residents who received the talk-only intervention or no intervention, even after controlling for individual differences.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Exercise therapy</I>
</B>
<I>:</I> A group of dementia patients were randomly assigned to one of three intervention/control groups: exercise, sedentary activity, and control. No significant difference was found in frequency of the targeted behaviours (wandering, rummaging, and aggressive behaviours) after twelve weeks of intervention when compared to base frequency for each group or when twelve-week frequencies for each group were compared (<LINK REF="REF-Gillogly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillogly 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>A number of studies of walking/exercise therapies have been carried out in both in the community and the institutional setting, e.g. treadmill training, activity training to reduce fear of falling (<LINK REF="REF-Toulotte-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toulotte 2003</LINK>), planned walking (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1991</LINK>), combined walking and conversation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Tappen-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tappen 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tappen-2000c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tappen 2000c</LINK>), self-paced resistance training (<LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1997</LINK>), 'special steps' (<LINK REF="REF-Wishart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wishart 2000</LINK>) and so on. However, these are all aimed at cognition, communication and mobility. These interventions do not measure the impact on wandering.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<B>
<I>Wander gardens</I>
</B>: While there is growing interest in the addition of wander gardens to existing and new dementia care units, the literature describing the benefits for patients with dementia in long-term care settings is largely anecdotal (<LINK REF="REF-Detweiler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detweiler 2002</LINK>).</P>

<B>
<U>Environmental modification interventions</U>
</B>
<B>

<B>
<I>Subjective barriers</I>
</B> like mirrors, floor grids, camouflaging door knobs. More information on these can be found in the Cochrane review of 'Subjective barriers to prevent wandering of cognitively impaired people' (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2001</LINK> - last updated 2005).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Home environmental programs</I>
</B>: several RCTs of a home-based therapy intervention versus usual care were designed to enhance the skills of caregivers in using the physical and social environment to address troublesome behaviours and dependency associated with the progression of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2005</LINK>). The intervention in each trial involved a number of 90-minute home visits by occupational therapists who worked with families to identify care giving issues (wandering was frequently identified by caregivers as problematic) and generate environmental-based solutions. Solutions ranged from no cost recommendations (e.g., removing clutter, simplifying the environment), to resource dependent recommendations (e.g., installing grab bars or handrails) (<LINK REF="REF-Corcoram-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corcoram 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 2000</LINK>). Usual care consisted of education materials and a booklet describing home environmental safety tips at conclusion of study. While these studies were a success in the sense that carers did adopt a lot of the strategies, the outcomes in terms of behavioural difficulties or carer stress and institutionalisation are not at all clear. Wandering was not measured as an outcome and so no data are available which would allow us to look at the efficacy of these interventions with regards to wandering.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Safety home</I>
</B>
<B> </B>is the use of safety devices (alarms, child proof locks and dead bolts out of sight of the person with dementia) to prevent people with dementia hurting themselves. No studies using this type of intervention were found at all.</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Behavioural modification interventions</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Behavioural nursing intervention: </I>
</B>this was a multiple case study to determine if the systematic use of a behavioural nursing intervention would have an effect on mealtime behaviour of wanderers in terms of time spent sitting at the dining table and food intake and body weight. The intervention required a trained intervener to 'administer' systematic behavioural conditioning: this involved systematic reinforcement<B> </B>of sitting-at-table behaviour by the person with dementia using two communication strategies: focused conversation about the meal, eating and social comments related to the mealtime experience and specific elements of social behaviour (smiling, eye contact). The intervention was successful in that all participants were able to sit at the table longer and eat more food during the intervention. However, their body weight remained stable throughout the study (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2004</LINK>)</P>

</B>
<B>: </B>in a randomised crossover pilot study carried out by <LINK REF="REF-Kolanowski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolanowski 2001</LINK> activities for people with dementia in a nursing home were tailored so that they matched the cognitive physical abilities as well as their style of interest in the hope that this would result in greater engagement, more positive mood and less disruptive behaviour (wandering being one such behaviour) as compared to the standard treatment which consisted of activities that matched skill level only. Although the study did not find any difference between self-reported mood, negative affect or extent of participation between the experimental treatment and control treatment, subjects had fewer days when any disruptive behaviour was exhibited during the experimental treatment activities.</P>

All but one of them so far include only studies with patients in institutional settings and none of them has any data specifically on wandering although most of them use behavioural outcome scales that do contain wandering components. The Cochrane review of Aromatherapy does contain one study with people with dementia in the domestic setting (<LINK REF="REF-Thorgrimsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorgrimsen 2002</LINK>) and includes behaviour as an outcome but no separate data for wandering are available.<B>

</B>registration and identification program: this is a program of the American Alzheimer Association whereby the person with dementia or the carer fills out a form, supplies a photograph and chooses the type of identification product (a necklace, bracelet etc) that the registrant will wear or carry. This info is then entered on a confidential database available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This program can assist in the timely return of people with dementia. No studies were found which compared this program to another intervention or no intervention.</P>

<U>Electronic tagging</U>

</P>
<P>There are two separate tagging systems for wandering: one sets boundaries and when these are breached, carers are alerted to the fact that the patient may be in danger. This type of tagging does not tell you where a person is. The second one, ethically much more controversial, is a true tracking device: using a Global Positioning System (GPS) somebody can keep track of where exactly the person with dementia is at all times. Much has written about this but few experimental studies have been carried out.<B>

<I>Electronic tagging used to restrain a person within a limited area</I>
</B>: <LINK REF="REF-Takada-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takada 1998</LINK> reports a new system used in the institutional setting to prevent an elderly person with dementia from wandering. When a patient carrying a very small transponder (325 mm * 385 mm in size) reaches a gate where receiving equipment is set up, the computer which is connected to the receiver identifies the patient and triggers the playing of music while alerting staff. By playing music, the wandering could be interrupted for several minutes. This system is very compact and cheap and the weak electric wave used does not affect any medical equipment. As this system prevents the patient from leaving through the gate, patients are kept safe. In addition, it is possible to analyse the patient's specific wandering pattern, which can be useful for his care. <LINK REF="REF-Miskelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miskelly 2004</LINK> reports a non-randomised study with similar technology in a nursing home and points out that such a system requires no permanent wiring, is easy to install and only generates an alarm when wearers of the bracelet approach a pre-defined area of risk. The bracelet is specially constructed so as to require two hands for its removal (but one resident out of the 39 managed to remove it). An equivalent system, using one bracelet, one pager and one monitor, was tested by clients and relatives who lived at home in the community. The system was successful in detecting potential wandering events and no untoward incidents have occurred. </P>

</B>reports the first feasibility study of electronic tracking devices. The likely demand for an electronic tracking device was assessed by means of a telephone survey of 99 carers; 24 people with dementia<B>
<I> </I>
</B>took part in the feasibility study but only 9 of them used the device consistently. The telephone survey revealed that a substantial degree of risk to people with dementia is tolerated (e.g. 44% of those who went out alone had a poor record of road safety but 42% of those who had already got lost continued to go out unaccompanied) most likely because 78% of these people did not stray too far from home. An electronic device would have been helpful in reducing risk in 18%. There are barriers to the use of tracking devices that are not technical or ethical: someone needs to recognize that the person with dementia is at risk, someone will need to ensure that the device is attached to the person with dementia and go and fetch them when the device bleeps. In this study a direction-finding system was used (adapted from use for animals in the wild): the receiving device was too large for some carers to use and in urban settings it was only reliable over short ranges. Cooperation of patients in the use of the device was variable (although of course all had expressly agreed to participate, the researchers concluded that intolerance of the device was a practical bar to its continued use).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Miskelly-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miskelly 2005</LINK> describes a pilot study in the community in which mobile phone technology was used to track patients electronically. There are of course technical constraints but in this study these were not a problem. But user compliance was a problem: when carers had trouble using the phone correctly and became frustrated then this led to neglect and rejection of the system. However when compliance was high, the tracking system was highly reliable and accurate and most participants were located within 10 minutes. The ethical issues relating to tracking people with dementia were discussed extensively at the local research ethics committee before the trial began. It was felt that this technology, if successful, would be the least restrictive method of helping the problem of wandering in dementia and would be preferable to chemical alternatives.</P>
<P>In this context it is worth mentioning the US-based Project Lifesaver (www.projectlifesaver.org). By forming partnerships with local law enforcement and public safety organizations, Project Lifesaver deploys specially trained teams with the most reliable technology available to quickly locate and return wandering adults and children to their families and caregivers. Project Lifesaver relies on proven radio technology and a specially trained search and rescue team. Clients who are enrolled in the Project Lifesaver program wear a personalized wristband that emits a tracking signal. When caregivers notify the local Project Lifesaver agency that the person is missing, a search and rescue team responds to the wanderer's area and starts searching with the mobile locater tracking system. Search times have been reduced from hours and days to minutes. In over 1000 searches, there have been no reported serious injuries or deaths. Recovery times average less than 30 minutes. </P>
<P>However, to date no randomised controlled trials have been carried out to prove or disprove the efficacy of electronic tagging.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>

<B>Selection of Studies</B>
<BR/>No suitable randomised controlled studies for inclusion were found at all. If at future update searches suitable studies will be identified, then the titles, abstracts and descriptors of citations identified by the search will be examined by two reviewers (DH and UHH) independently; those deemed to be clearly irrelevant will be discarded. Full text copies of the remaining citations will be retrieved and assessed independently by DH and UHH for inclusion in the review using the criteria described above. Consensus will be reached by referral of disagreements at any stage of study selection to the third reviewer (RM).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Quality Assessment</B>
<BR/>The internal validity of trials is related to how successfully selection, performance, attrition and detection biases are eliminated. If and when suitable trials are identified at future update searches, the quality of included trials will be assessed using one of the Cochrane approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment (randomizations; placebo-controlled; concealed allocation).<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain.<BR/>Grade C: Inadequate concealment; no randomizations.<BR/>The rating of quality will be described in the table of included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Extraction</B>
<BR/>If and when suitable trials are identified at future update searches, 'Intention to treat analysis' will be applied to data obtained on every randomised patient, without exception. In the absence of ITT data, data for 'on-treatment analysis' will be extracted and indicated as such.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>For continuous variables, or ordinal variables approximated to continuous variables, outcomes of interest will be the assessment score at the time point considered, and the change from baseline (i.e., pre-randomizations or at randomisation) at this point.</LI>
<LI>Data on adverse effects and dropouts will be recorded.</LI>
<LI>For some binary and ordinal outcomes (i.e., improved versus not improved) the end-point itself will be of clinical relevance; because all patients, by definition, will have had the same initial score.</LI>
<LI>Where present numerical scores will be used to assess response to treatment; in some instances, because of variation in the way response to treatment may be measured, it may necessary to operationalize outcomes as 'improved' versus 'not improved', regardless of the scale used by the authors.</LI>

<BR/>
<B>Data Analysis<BR/>
</B>If and when suitable trials are identified at future update searches:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Missing data and drop-out rates will be assessed for each of the included studies. The number of participants who are included in the final analysis will be reported as a proportion of all participants in the study.</LI>
<LI>For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the odds ratio and risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated.</LI>
<LI>Continuous data with a normal distribution (or approximating to a normal distribution) will be analysed using RevMan Analyses software if means and standard deviations are available or are obtainable from the authors of studies. Appropriate non-parametric tests will be used to analyse data not normally distributed.</LI>
<LI>If there are sufficient data and it is appropriate to do so, one or more meta-analyses will be performed. Decisions on whether to combine studies for meta-analyses will be made depending on the comparability of interventions and comparators used in individual studies.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is no information available on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting. Literature searches revealed a total absence of randomized controlled trials in this area. Wandering is rarely studied in itself, even in institutional settings, despite a growing interest in the behavioural disturbances caused by dementia: wandering is usually included among the various aspects of 'agitation' or 'aberrant motor behaviours' or 'BPSD' (Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia). </P>
<P>The fact that wandering is not a static or simple behaviour and the lack of a 'theory' of wandering makes it hard to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach often without due consideration of the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. </P>
<P>The studies that are available suggest that it might be useful to distinguish between 'wandering at home and in the garden' and 'getting lost from one's own dwelling'. The solution to the latter type of wandering may be the use of electronic tagging. As McShane points out, if it is ethically proper to search for people with dementia, then surely it would be proper to do so with help of a tracking device (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McShane-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 1994b</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the absence of any randomised controlled trials, there is no evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Wandering of people with dementia in the domestic setting is often what leads to institutionalisation, which is costly and not necessarily what the people involved would wish. Randomised controlled trials of electronic tagging and home environmental interventions, possibly along the lines of Project Lifesaver, are urgently needed.</P>
