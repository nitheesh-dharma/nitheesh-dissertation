<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:04:59 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Methyldopa is a medication that has been used to treat high blood pressure since the 1960s. While there is some belief methyldopa reduces blood pressure, there are concerns due to the potential for this drug to cause adverse effects. The aim of this review was to determine the extent to which methyldopa reduces blood pressure, the nature of methyldopa's adverse effect profile, and to determine the clinical impact of its use for hypertension.The search revealed 12 trials with a total of 595 patients that were randomized to either a methyldopa treatment arm (296 patients) or a placebo treatment arm (299 patients). The daily doses of methyldopa used in these studies ranged 500-2250 mg daily. The most commonly studied daily dose of methyldopa was 750 mg daily. Most studies followed patients for four to six weeks of therapy. None of the studies reported on the clinical impact of methyldopa (e.g. if methyldopa reduced the risk of having a stroke compared to placebo). Overall reporting of adverse effects was poor so no conclusions can be drawn about the adverse effect profile. This meta-analysis shows that methyldopa reduces systolic/diastolic blood pressure by approximately 13/8 mmHg compared to placebo.</P>

<P>Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, which was commonly used in the 1970's and 80's for blood pressure control. Its use at present has largely been replaced by antihypertensive drug classes with less side effects, but it is still used in developing countries due to its low cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:39:56 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>To quantify the effect of methyldopa compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:00:51 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1960-June 2009), MEDLINE (2005-June 2009), and EMBASE (2007-June 2009). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:02:04 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Twelve trials (N=595) met the inclusion criteria for this review. None of these studies evaluated the effects of methyldopa compared to placebo on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Data for withdrawals due to adverse effects were not reported in a way that permitted meaningful meta-analysis. Data from six of the twelve trials (N=231) were combined to evaluate the blood pressure lowering effects of methyldopa compared to placebo. This meta-analysis shows that methyldopa at doses ranging from 500-2250 mg daily lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of 13 (95%CI 6-20) / 8 (95% CI 4-13)<B> </B>mmHg. Overall, the risk of bias was considered moderate.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:07:45 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 22:10:35 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is associated with structural changes in the heart and blood vessels which may lead to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e. cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease). Hypertension is typically defined as having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#8805; 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#8805; 90 mm Hg (<LINK REF="REF-CHEP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHEP 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>). Worldwide, approximately 1 billion people are affected by hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>) and seven million deaths per year may be attributed to hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In addition, for every 20 mm Hg increase in SBP and 10 mm Hg increase in DBP (through the range from 115/75 to 185/115 mm Hg) in people aged 40 to 70 years, the risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity doubles (<LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>). This emphasizes the importance of finding safe and effective treatments for the prevention of the associated mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:06:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Methyldopa (&#945;-methyl-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) is an analog of DOPA (3,4-hydroxyphenylanine) and is a prodrug which requires metabolism to an active metabolite in order to exert its effects in the central nervous system. It was discovered over five decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1955</LINK>) and its blood pressure lowering effects were discovered shortly after, in 1959 (<LINK REF="REF-Sjoerdsma-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjoerdsma 1982</LINK>). In the 1970's and 80's methyldopa was considered an effective antihypertensive agent especially in the elderly, patients with renal insufficiency, and pregnancy. The JNC hypertension guidelines in 1977 recommended methyldopa as add on therapy after diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methyldopa has been associated with a wide spectrum of adverse events including CNS depressant effects (drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy, depression), decreased libido, dry mouth, hepatitis, myocarditis, and haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-06-30 16:27:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methyldopa is metabolized to &#945;-methylnorepinephrine, which acts as an agonist at presynaptic &#945;<SUB>2</SUB> adrenergic receptors in the brainstem and results in the inhibition adrenergic neuronal outflow. The attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem reduces the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, leading to blood pressure reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:07:45 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The side effect profile of methyldopa, combined with introduction of newer antihypertensives that claim to produce an improved quality of life has resulted in methyldopa being removed from most treatment guidelines for hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Croog-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croog 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite these changes in the guidelines, methyldopa is still widely used in developing countries. Possible reasons for its continued use include: no adverse effect on biochemistry, compatibility with other antihypertensive agents and low cost compared to newer, more expensive agents. It is important to review the evidence of benefit and harm of methyldopa since clinicians in developing countries continue to prescribe methyldopa despite its absence from treatment guidelines. The primary purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of methyldopa compared to placebo in lowering blood pressure, morbidity, and mortality.</P>

<P>Study characteristics and the outcome measures of interest were collected independently by the two reviewers using a pre-formed standardized data extraction sheet. Data was then cross-checked and any differences in interpretation of the data was resolved through further examination and consensus between the reviewers. The data extracted from each study included the following: patient characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, and co-morbid conditions; methods including means of random allocation of participants to trial interventions, allocation concealment, blinding of patients, health care providers, and outcomes assessors, losses to follow-up and how they were handled, and duration of trial follow-up; interventions including dose and duration of methyldopa used; outcome measures as described above. All data, regardless of compliance or completion of follow up, was collected in order to allow for analysis by intention to treat.</P>
<P>The position of the patient during blood pressure measurement may affect the blood pressure lowering effect.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:17:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>For evaluation of the primary outcomes (e.g. mortality, serious adverse events, cerebrovascular events, and cardiac events), the total number of patients with at least one event within each trial were to be recorded as a percent. Proportions were to be calculated for these dichotomous outcomes, and comparisons between groups were to be presented as relative risk ratios (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals). This was, however, not done as none of the included trials reported on these outcomes.</P>
<P>One of the included cross-over RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 1980</LINK>) was considered appropriate for inclusion in the meta-analysis of blood pressure effect because pooled standard error (SE) of mean blood pressure and end of study mean blood pressure in the methyldopa and placebo treatment periods were provided. This data was entered using the generic inverse variance outcome method. Subsequently all other parallel group RCTs' blood pressure data was entered in the same way. One parallel group RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Aronow-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Aronow 1977</LINK>) provided SE of the mean for end of study blood pressure in each treatment group. These SEs were converted to standard deviations (SD). In <LINK REF="STD-Aronow-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Aronow 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mroczek-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mroczek 1974</LINK> both end of study mean blood pressures and SDs were provided for each treatment group. End of study mean blood pressures and SDs were then entered into RevMan 5 to determine the mean difference and 95% CI for end of study BP between methyldopa and placebo. The boundaries of the 95% CI were subtracted from each other and the difference was divided by 3.92 in order to calculate the pooled standard error for the difference in end of study blood pressure between groups. This data was then entered using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study randomized patients were further divided into Group I (mild hypertension) and Group II (moderately severe hypertension) in each treatment group. For each Group I and each Group II, end of study mean blood pressures and SDs were provided. For the methyldopa patients, Group I was combined with Group II by calculating a weighted mean blood pressure and weighted mean SD. This was also done for the placebo patients. The difference in mean blood pressure was calculated using the end of study mean blood pressure and SD for the combined methyldopa group and the combined placebo group. The pooled standard error and difference in end of study mean blood pressure between groups was calculated using the method described above and entered using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975</LINK> study only mean change in blood pressure at end of study was reported for each group. The mean change for methyldopa was subtracted from the mean change in the placebo group and this was then entered as the difference in end of study mean blood pressure between groups using the generic inverse variance method. <LINK REF="STD-Paran-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Paran 1993</LINK> only reported end of study mean blood pressures in each treatment group.

<P>The search strategy identified 785 citations in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE. Following a review of their titles and abstracts, 734 citations that clearly did not meet our inclusion criteria were excluded while 51 citations were selected for further review. There are two articles that have not been retrieved to date and two articles awaiting translation (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). The manufacturer of methyldopa was not able to provide any additional clinical trials of interest for this review. Accordingly, the full articles of 47 potentially eligible citations were reviewed, and from their reference lists, an additional ten studies were identified and reviewed. Of these 57 citations, we excluded 43. Most of the excluded trials were excluded because participants were not randomized to a methyldopa only or a placebo only treatment arm during the study period. Of the 14 citations that met our inclusion criteria, two proved to be duplicate publications (Bar-On 1993, Yodfat 1996) of <LINK REF="STD-Yodfat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yodfat 1993</LINK>.

<P>Out of the 12 included studies, seven studies were randomized controlled parallel trials, four studies were randomized cross-over trials, and one study was a single-dose trial. From these trials, a total of 595 patients were randomized to either a methyldopa treatment arm (296 patients) or a placebo treatment arm (299 patients). The daily doses of methyldopa used in these studies ranged 500-2250 mg daily. The most commonly studied daily dose of methyldopa was 750 mg daily. Treatment durations with methyldopa of the included studies ranged from three to 52 weeks (excluding the single-dose study). Most studies evaluated the effects of methyldopa given over four to six weeks.</P>
<P>A summary of each of the 12 trials which met our inclusion criteria is presented below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aronow-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Aronow 1977</LINK>
</P>
<P>This randomized trial compared the effects of either methyldopa, trimazosin, or placebo on supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate in men with essential hypertension. Clinical cardiovascular outcomes were not investigated. The mean baseline standing blood pressure of the patients was 164.2/104.0 mm Hg. The trial followed up 18 patients with an average age of 53.8 years (+/- 7.8 years) for 17 weeks. At the end of the trial, one patient from the methyldopa treatment arm dropped out secondary to a drug-related adverse effect.</P>

</P>
<P>This randomized trial was similar in design to <LINK REF="STD-Aronow-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Aronow 1977</LINK>. Again, clinical cardiovascular outcomes were not investigated. The mean baseline standing blood pressure of the patients was 152.2/104.7 mm Hg. The trial followed up 57 patients with an average age of 49.6 years (+/- 10.7 years) for 16 weeks. At the end of the trial, ten patients dropped out of the trial: two patients developed methyldopa-induced drug fever, three patients failed to meet the study's inclusion criteria following randomization, two patients were lost to follow up, two patients were non-compliant with taking trial medications, and one patient dropped out of the study without any specified adequate reason.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 1980</LINK>
</P>
<P>This randomized cross-over trial was designed to evaluate the effects of four interventions on supine and standing blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: methyldopa alone, chlorothiazide alone, placebo alone, or combination therapy with methyldopa and chlorothiazide. Clinical cardiovasuclar outcomes were not investigated. Patients were assessed in each treatment arm for four weeks and then entered a two-week washout period before crossing over to the next treatment arm. The mean baseline standing blood pressure of the patients was 163.9/109.5 mm Hg. The trial followed up 24 patients aged 21-68 for 25 weeks. At the end of the trial, one patient dropped from study secondary to a drug-related adverse effect while in the chlorothiazide arm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1984</LINK>
</P>
<P>This randomized trial compared the effects of either methyldopa, captopril, indapamide, or placebo on supine blood pressure, arterial blood flow, and peripheal resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Patients randomized to the methyldopa and captopril arms received only a single dose during the steady, whereas patients receiving indapamide and placebo remained on the medication for four weeks. Clinical cardiovascular outcomes were not investigated. The baseline mean arterial pressure of the patients ranged 120.8-128.0 mm Hg. For patients stratified to the methyldopa arm, supine blood pressure was measured at baseline, and then at 30 minutes and four hours following the single dose. The trial followed up 24 patients aged 26-60 years and all of these patients were accounted for at the end of the study period.</P>

<P>This randomized cross-over trial was designed to evaluate the effects of methyldopa or placebo on supine and standing blood pressure and various psychometric tests in patients with essential hypertension. Clinical cardiovascular outcomes were not investigated. The mean baseline untreated diastolic blood pressure ranged 90-105 mm Hg. Patients were assessed in each treatment arm for three weeks with no washout period between the two treatment arms. The trial followed up 16 patients aged 26-67 years for ten weeks. Patient withdrawals and patients lost to follow up were not reported.</P>

<P>For the overall assessment of the risk of bias in included studies see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Information pertaining to allocation concealment from all 12 included studes was insufficient to evaluate this aspect of reporting bias. Also, in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mroczek-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mroczek 1974</LINK>), details concerning methods of sequence generation for participant randomization were not provided. The authors recognize that poor reporting of study methodology does not necessarily imply that the study is methodologically flawed. Accordingly, it is our interpretation that since this aspect of quality reporting is unknown, the results from the majority of the studies included for this review may overestimate or underestimate the true effect of methyldopa for the prespecified outcomes of interest, or the results may be accurate.</P>
<P>In general, blinding of participants and investigators was adequate in 10 of the 12 included studies for this review based on simple reporting. However, the methods of blinding were adequately described in only four of these 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mroczek-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mroczek 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petrie-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Petrie 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK>). Morever, blinding may have been compromised during the trials in view of the fact that limited details were provided with regards to treatment-emergent adverse effects with methyldopa. For instance, CNS depressant effects and gastrointestinal side effects may incidentally reveal which patients were randomized to receive methyldopa during the study. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>) were open label studies.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the majority of included trials were compromised by incomplete reporting of outcomes data. Specifically, of the 12 included studies, seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aronow-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Aronow 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paran-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Paran 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petrie-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Petrie 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yodfat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yodfat 1993</LINK>) either did not adequately report outcomes data for all randomized patients, failed to explain reasons for censoring results data of certain patients, and/or did not provide any details with regards to patients lost to follow up. Most trials did not report their results using the intention-to-treat principle. As such, the poor quality of outcomes data reporting in the included trials may again result in errors of estimation of the true effect of methyldopa compared to placebo on the prespecified outcomes of interest in this review.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies were free of selective reporting. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>) did not report on certain prespecified outcomes and another study (<LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975</LINK>) reported outcomes that were not prespecified. It is important to note, however, that most studies did not state predefined primary and secondary outcomes in their trial methodology. Moreover, most trials did not report treatment-emergent adverse effects or serious adverse events in any systematic manner that can be used in a meaningful meta-analysis for this review.</P>

From these seven trials, a total of 231 patients were randomized to either methyldopa (N=116) or placebo (N=115) treatment arms. These patients received either methyldopa or placebo control for treatment durations that ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Doses of methyldopa used in these seven studies ranged from 500 mg daily to 2250 mg daily.</P>
<P>The analysis of mean difference in SBP (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) found that methyldopa reduced SBP by 22.73 mmHg (95%CI 19.39-26.08, p&lt;0.00001) however there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=97%). When the data from the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study (the effect size of this particular trial was large relative to other trials) was de-selected, the analysis found that methyldopa reduced SBP by 11.64 mmHg (95%CI 7.90-15.38, p&lt;0.00001) with significant but relatively less heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=69%). When the random effects model was used for this analysis the statistical significance did not change. Specifically, using the random effects model, methyldopa reduced SBP by 21.88 mmHg (95%CI 2.63-41.14, p&lt;0.03, I<SUP>2</SUP>=97%) when the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study was included, and 13.09 mmHg (95%CI 5.77-20.41, p=0.0005, I<SUP>2</SUP>=69%) when the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study was not included. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of removing trials for which pooled standard error was imputed. This analysis found that methyldopa produced a reduction in SBP of 15.18mmHg (95% CI 10.70-19.67, p&lt;0.00001), a result similar to the original analysis. This analysis also detected significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=59%) and when the data was re-analyzed using a random effects model the reduction in SBP remained statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).</P>
<P>The analysis of mean difference in DBP (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) found that methyldopa reduced DBP by 8.07 mmHg (95%CI 6.23-9.90, p&lt;0.00001) however there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=73%). When the data from the Tiwari 1982 study (the effect size of this particular trial was large relative to other trials) was de-selected, the analysis found that methyldopa reduced DBP by 7.51 mmHg (95%CI 5.40-9.62, p&lt;0.00001) with significant and similar heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=76%). When the random effects model was used for this analysis the statistical significance did not change. Specifically, using the random effects model, methyldopa reduced DBP by 8.53 mmHg (95%CI 4.84-12.21, p&lt;0.00001, I<SUP>2</SUP>=73%) when the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study was included, and 8.39 mmHg (95%CI 3.87-12.92, p=0.0003, I<SUP>2</SUP>=76%) when the <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 1982</LINK> study was not included. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of removing trials for which pooled standard error was imputed. This analysis found that methyldopa produced a reduction in DBP of 9.61 mmHg (95% CI 7.00-12.22, p&lt;0.00001), a result similar to the original analysis. This analysis also detected significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=61%) and when the data was re-analyzed using a random effects model the reduction in DBP remained statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).</P>

One randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yodfat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yodfat 1993</LINK>) was not included in this meta-analysis because the authors did not specify the final number of patients who completed each treatment arm when reporting their results.

<P>Unfortunately, none of the included studies for this review reported results for the following clinical outcomes: all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal and non-fatal stroke. Also, the trials did not report the numbers of patients experiencing at least one adverse event or the numbers of patients with withdrawals due to adverse effects in a manner that would permit a meaningful meta-analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:35:50 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the effects of methyldopa versus placebo for mortality, morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse effects, or total adverse effects. Although not included in this review, other randomized trials which tested methyldopa against non-placebo controls also did not find any differences in clinical outcomes. For instance, in <LINK REF="REF-Sprackling-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprackling 1981</LINK>, 123 elderly subjects (mean age 80 years) with a single casual diastolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or more were randomized to treatment with methyldopa 250 mg twice daily (which was subsequently adjusted as necessary to bring the standing diastolic blood pressure towards target of 90 mmHg) and was compared to no treatment (i.e. did not receive medication over and above any treatment that their general practitioner deemed to be necessary for other aspects of their health).  Standing SBP/DBP was reduced significantly by -18.3/ -7.8 mmHg but there were no significant differences between the groups in mortality or morbidity.</P>
<P>Methyldopa was commonly used in the 1970's and 80's for blood pressure control. Even though its use at present has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, it is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost. Although there is insufficient information to make conclusions about adverse effects from this review, it is important to note that adverse effects of methyldopa are not uncommon and can be serious. They include immune mediated haemolytic anemia (20% Coombs positive), hepatotoxicity (5% increased liver enzymes) and a lupus-like syndrome (Goodman &amp; Gilman 1996). Thus, in addition to the fact that this review did not find any evidence of clinical outcomes benefit for the use of methyldopa in patients with primary hypertension, healthcare practitioners should also be aware that there are potential serious side effects associated with the use of methyldopa.</P>
<P>The analysis of six trials that provided data that was amenable for meta-analysis found that methyldopa reduced SBP by 13.09 (5.77-20.41) mmHg and reduced DBP by 8.39 (2.87-12.92) mmHg over and above reductions in blood pressure due to placebo. The imputation of pooled standard error for two trials did not impact the finding as the confidence intervals for blood pressure reductions overlapped when data from these trials was removed. Similar reductions were also seen in trials that were not included in the meta-analysis (i.e. methyldopa was associated with SBP reductions of from approximately 15-20 mmHg and DBP reductions of approximately 10 mmHg).</P>

<P>While contact was made with certain authors (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yodfat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yodfat 1993</LINK>), further study information was not made available secondary to the dated nature of the trials. In general, reporting of outcomes was incomplete in all trials. The applicability of the results is therefore limited as the data may not be reliable (i.e. results are likely to represent an overestimate of the effects of methyldopa versus placebo).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-07-28 00:07:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence was compromised secondary to the unclear nature of random sequence generation and allocation concealment procedures of almost all trials. Moreover, many of the trials did not report complete outcomes data for all randomized patients. Thus, the estimation of the true effect of methyldopa on outcomes such as BP effects is likely an overestimate.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 15:39:07 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>Methyldopa lowers blood pressure in patients with primary (essential) hypertension, when given at doses 500-2250 mg daily compared to placebo. Clinicians who wish to recommend methyldopa for their patients should understand, however, that while methyldopa may reduce blood pressure, to the best of our knowledge, there are no known clinical studies which have associated use of methyldopa with a reduction in all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In addition, despite poor reporting of treatment-emergent adverse effects, clinicians must weigh the risks of potential serious side effects with use of methyldopa that include hemolytic anemia, hepatotoxicity as well as lupus-like syndrome against the benefits of blood pressure reduction with no proven beneficial effect on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:37:40 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Despite methyldopa's use as an antihypertensive agent for patients with essential hypertension since the 1970's, the prescribing of this agent has been based solely on blood pressure reduction studies. Because of the relatively high incidence of adverse effects associated with this drug, large trials comparing methyldopa with other classes of antihypertensive drugs are not recommended.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2009-08-08 12:51:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>The protocol did not state that randomized cross-over trials would be included. This type of trial was included as the search did not retrieve many parallel group RCTs and it was thought that properly done randomized cross-over RCTs would add to the knowledge of the effects of methyldopa on blood pressure. In addition a hierarchy of standard deviation data to be used for imputation was added keeping in line with previous reviews from the Cochrane Hypertension Review Group.</P>
<P>Michael Kandler was a co-author of the protocol but was unable to participate in the conduct of the full review therefore his name does not appear in the list of authors. Vijaya Musini was added as an author as her expertise was needed in terms of analyzing data using generic inverse variance.</P>
