<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:15:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Trachoma is common in people living in poor communities and is the most common infectious cause of vision loss. Repeated bouts of conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membranes of the eyes) caused by <I>Chlamydia </I>infection eventually lead to scarring and inward turning of the eyelid. The lashes rub on the cornea causing opacification and blindness. Antibiotics can be used to treat the <I>Chlamydia </I>infection and may be given as an ointment or by mouth. This review included 14 trials in 3587 people with ocular trachoma and eight community-based trials (67 communities). Antibiotic treatment reduce conjunctivitis caused by trachoma ('active trachoma') and ocular infection in individuals. Community-based trials provided evidence that azithromycin treatment reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular <I>Chlamydia</I> infection.</P>

<P>Trachoma is the world's leading infectious cause of blindness. In 1997 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by the year 2020, based on the 'SAFE' strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement).</P>

<P>To assess the evidence supporting the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective) and on <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> (<I>C. trachomatis</I>) infection of the conjunctiva (secondary objective).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-09 13:10:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1950 to December 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2010), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) (December 2010) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) (December 2010). We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the included studies. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and we contacted authors and experts for details of further relevant studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 12 December 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-08-22 12:12:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised trials that satisfied either of two criteria: (a) trials in which topical or oral administration of an antibiotic was compared to placebo or no treatment in people or communities with trachoma, (b) trials in which a topical antibiotic was compared with an oral antibiotic in people or communities with trachoma. A subdivision of particular interest was trials in which topical tetracycline or chlortetracycline and oral azithromycin were compared with each other, or in which one of these treatments was compared with placebo or no treatment, as these are the two WHO recommended antibiotics. We considered individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials separately.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-02-08 11:46:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for missing data. Where appropriate, the effect estimates from the individual studies (risk ratios) were pooled using a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 19:43:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>A total of 14 trials randomised individuals with trachoma to oral antibiotic, topical antibiotic, both, or control (no treatment or placebo) and were eligible for inclusion in this review (n = 3587). Overall, the quality of the evidence provided from these trials was low. Nine of the trials compared antibiotic treatment to control. Most of the studies found a beneficial effect of treatment on active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection at three and 12 months follow up. There was considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials, which meant that it was difficult to reliably estimate the size of the treatment effect. It is likely to be in the region of a 20% relative risk reduction. Seven of the 14 trials compared the effectiveness of oral and topical antibiotics. There was no consistent evidence as to whether oral or topical antibiotics were more effective, although one trial suggested that a single dose of oral azithromycin was significantly more effective than unsupervised use of topical tetracycline</P>
<P>A further eight trials assessed the effectiveness of community-based treatment. In five trials antibiotic treatment was compared to no (or delayed) treatment (57 communities), and in three trials oral antibiotic was compared to topical treatment (12 communities). The quality of the evidence provided by these trials was variable but at least one trial was considered to provide high quality evidence. There was evidence that community-based antibiotic treatment reduced the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection 12 months after single-dose treatment. There was some evidence that oral azithromycin was more effective than topical tetracycline as a community treatment. Data on adverse effects were not consistently reported however there were no reported serious adverse events associated with treatment with oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline; in one sample survey of 671 people treated with azithromycin between 10% and 15% experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea or vomiting, or both).</P>

<P>Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection in people infected with <I>C. trachomatis</I>, but we do not know for certain the size of the treatment effect in individuals.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-19 09:46:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 13:47:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Trachoma is the world's leading infectious cause of blindness (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2004</LINK>). Active trachoma affects an estimated 41 million people, the majority of them children (<LINK REF="REF-Mariotti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariotti 2009</LINK>). About 1.3 million people are blind as a consequence of trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2004</LINK>). It is a disease of poverty and is associated with poor water supplies and sanitation.</P>
<P>There are two phases of trachoma. In the first phase, most frequently seen in infancy and childhood, there are repeated attacks of conjunctivitis caused by the organism <I>Chlamydia trachomatis </I>(<I>C. trachomatis</I>). The conjunctivitis is characterised by the presence of follicles on the under surface of the upper eyelid and by vascular changes in active trachoma. Active trachoma is associated with discharge from the eyes and nose that is particularly noticeable on the faces of children, but the active stage may also be asymptomatic in children and adults. When symptomatic, symptoms may persist for months after the infection is cleared. <I>C. trachomatis</I> is transmitted from child to child and from child to mother and back to child through eye-finger-eye contacts, fomites and via eye-seeking flies.</P>
<P>Repeated conjunctival infections over a number of years lead to the second phase of disease, characterised by scarring and shortening of the upper eyelid. Ultimately, the lashes turn inwards to rub on the cornea, causing pain, corneal abrasions and secondary infection. Blindness results from corneal opacification. The blinding phase affects women more commonly than men and typically starts in adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2009</LINK>). The treatment at this stage is surgery to reposition the eyelid margin.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 13:48:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Active trachoma has been treated with antibiotics since the 1950s and a variety of regimens have been used. The antibiotic can be applied directly to the conjunctiva (topical) or taken orally (systemic). Antibiotics applied topically are usually in the form of an ointment and a variable amount is squeezed onto the inner surface of the lower eyelid. This route gives a high concentration of the antibiotic to the conjunctiva but a low dose to the nasopharynx, which is also a reservoir for the organism. Ointments may cause stinging eyes and temporary blurred vision, and they are difficult to apply to small children.</P>
<P>Oral treatment gives a higher dose of antibiotic to sites of infection outside of the eye, but systemic antibiotics can have various adverse effects in the person taking them. Bacteria anywhere in the body may also develop antibiotic resistance. A full course of oral treatment has a higher compliance rate than a course of topical antibiotic.</P>
<P>Efforts in trachoma control have used various antibiotic treatment regimens and have also been aimed at different subgroups within a trachoma endemic area. Examples of subgroups are only those individuals with clinical signs of disease (detected actively or passively), and active cases together with family contacts or high-risk groups including school children. Because many individuals harbour infection without demonstrating physical signs, it has been suggested that trachoma control cannot be achieved by antibiotic treatment given only to subgroups of a trachoma endemic community (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamiya-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kamiya 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutter-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutter 1983</LINK>). This led to the concept of community-based interventions, where all residents of a community should receive treatment irrespective of disease status.</P>
<P>The desired primary endpoint of any intervention against the active disease is reduction of blindness but this could only be demonstrated 20 to 30 years after the start of the intervention. The usual surrogate outcome measure in trachoma intervention trials is clinically active disease. In some trials a secondary endpoint is laboratory evidence of ocular <I>C. trachomatis </I>infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-09-03 11:36:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>International interest in trachoma was given a boost in 1997 when the WHO launched a new initiative for trachoma control, based on the 'SAFE' strategy. The components giving their name to the acronym are surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement. Cochrane systematic reviews on surgery for trichiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Yorston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorston 2006</LINK>), face washing (<LINK REF="REF-Ejere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejere 2004</LINK>) and environmental sanitary interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Rabiu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabiu 2007</LINK>) have also been completed.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended topical treatment is 1% tetracycline ointment to both eyes, either twice daily for six weeks or on five consecutive days each month for six months. Compliance with this treatment is poor due to the side effects of the ointment and the length of the treatment programme. The WHO recommended oral antibiotic is azithromycin, given as a single dose of one gram in adults and 20 mg/kg of body weight in children. Azithromycin has low plasma levels but high intracellular concentrations and a long half-life. It has been shown to be an effective treatment of genital chlamydial infections.</P>
<P>It is important to do this review to systematically evaluate the safety and effectiveness of these recommended treatment regimens.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:01:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the evidence in relation to the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective) and on <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection (secondary objective). In particular, when this review was first published in 2002, the aim was to investigate the strength of evidence that antibiotics were more effective than placebo in reducing disease and to compare the effects of oral azithromycin with topical tetracycline.</P>
<P>These objectives were modified when the review was updated in 2010. It was decided to consider individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials separately as we felt that they were addressing different questions and were likely to be measuring different effects. The following two objectives were identified.</P>
<P>1. What is the effect of antibiotic treatment for individuals on active trachoma and ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection?</P>
<P>2. What is the effect of community treatment with antibiotics on the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection?</P>

<P>This review includes only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotic treatment for active trachoma. Clinical and community-based trials were included in this review. In clinical trials the unit of randomisation was the individual with active trachoma and outcomes were reported at an individual level. In community-based trials the unit of randomisation was a community, in which some individuals had active trachoma, and outcomes may have been reported at an individual or a community level.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:01:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included trials in which the interventions were:</P>
<P>1. topical or oral administration of an antibiotic at any dose or frequency compared to placebo or no treatment;<BR/>2. topical administration of an antibiotic at any dose or frequency compared to oral administration of an antibiotic at any dose or frequency.</P>
<P>We excluded studies if the antibiotic was combined with an environmental or educational intervention unless this component was used uniformly across the trial and only the antibiotic treatment varied in the different groups.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:01:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We measured outcomes at three, 12 and 24 months after the start of treatment. Three months was the time at which the maximum effect on active trachoma was expected given that clinical signs take several months to resolve after the clearance of infection. We selected 12 months to represent the period during which recurrence of infection or relapse would be most likely to occur, and we selected 24 months to reflect the expected long-term result of one course of treatment. A course of treatment may be a single or multiple doses of an oral antibiotic or interrupted applications of a topical antibiotic applied over six weeks to several months.</P>
<P>In order to take into account the fact that studies may not have collected outcomes at those exact times, we defined the following ranges for each:</P>
<UL>
<LI>three months, i.e. outcomes measured before six months;</LI>
<LI>12 months, i.e. outcomes measured between six months and 18 months;</LI>
<LI>24 months, i.e. outcomes measured after 18 months.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If more than one outcome measurement was available, then we selected the nearest measurement to three, 12 or 24 months.</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2010-08-23 12:55:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome for this review was active trachoma. There are five main trachoma grading scales (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1975b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1975b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1981b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacCallan-1936" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacCallan 1936</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1962</LINK>). All these scales, except for MacCallan, quantify the number of follicles and the degree of vascular engorgement of the under surface of the upper eyelid as seen with low magnification (usually x 2.5). The Dawson scales subdivide the follicular and papillary activity as F 0 to 3 and P 0 to 3. The Thylefors scale is a simplified version defining active trachoma by the grades TF (mild-moderate) and TI (intense). The MacCallan scale is not directly comparable with the other scales as scarring is included as an indicator of active disease. The four more recent scales are broadly comparable. A minor inconsistency between them is that Dawson's F1 is defined as five or fewer follicles in zones two and three, and F2 as "more than 5 follicles in zones 2 and 3 together, but less than 5 in zone 3"; whereas TF is five or more follicles in zones two and three. This means that the divisions between F1 and F2 and 'not TF' and TF do not quite coincide.</P>
<P>In this review we defined the absence of active trachoma as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>not TF and not TI (Thylefors scale);</LI>
<LI>(P0 or P1 or P2) AND (F0 or F1) (WHO and Dawson scales).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We defined active trachoma as TF, TI, or both, in the Thylefors scale; or any other grade for P or F in the WHO or Dawson scales.<BR/>
</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:01:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The secondary outcome was a positive test for <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection. A variety of tests have been used to demonstrate presence of the pathogen. Historically, staining of conjunctival cells to show inclusion bodies was the first method of identifying infection. This was followed by culture of the organism, which was time consuming and lacking in sensitivity. The demonstration of antigen by various antibody staining methods followed, and finally identification of chlamydial DNA by various amplification methods. The tests, in order of increasing sensitivity, are:</P>
<P>1. culture by <I>C. trachomatis</I> isolation in eggs or tissue culture;<BR/>2. staining of conjunctival smears with giemsa or iodine;<BR/>3. direct fluorescent antibody cytology;<BR/>4. indirect enzyme immunoassay;<BR/>5. DNA hybridisation;<BR/>6. DNA amplification with the ligase chain reaction;<BR/>7. DNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 22:20:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This review includes trials in which individuals were randomly allocated to treatment and trials in which communities were the unit of allocation (cluster-randomised trials). A correct analysis of cluster-randomised trials includes an adjustment for the fact that people within a cluster tend to be more similar to each other than to people from other clusters i.e. the observations are not independent. The effect of cluster-randomisation is to increase the size of standard errors and hence widen the confidence intervals compared with a study of the same size using individual participant randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the update in 2011, our preferred method of analysis of cluster-randomised studies was as follows: for those studies that reported the effect measure using an analysis that properly accounted for the cluster design, we planned to enter and pool data from different studies using the generic-inverse variance method in RevMan. However, we were aware that cluster-randomised trials are not always analysed and reported appropriately. For those studies that did not report such an effect measure we planned to perform an approximate analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>) as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>calculate a 'design effect' of 1 + (M - 1) ICC (where ICC = intra-cluster correlation coefficient and M = average cluster size);</LI>
<LI>multiply the standard error of an analysis at the individual level by the square root of the design effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Estimates from the literature suggest that the ICC can vary from 0.05 to 0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>). We planned sensitivity analyses using iCC estimates of 0.05. 0.1 and 0.2.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-08-23 13:17:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical need to change or discontinue antibiotic therapy (for an individual undergoing treatment for a single episode of infection of disease, or a community undergoing a single round of mass treatment) is likely to be rare. This reduces the potential problems associated with performing the analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. More serious problems may arise from losses to follow up and non-compliance. Some of the trials have been done in largely transient populations in which losses to follow up rapidly accumulate as people move on. Such losses were assumed to be independent of the outcome measures, therefore we did not exclude studies on this basis.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-23 13:38:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As less than 10 trials were included in the meta-analyses in this version of the review we did not assess publication bias. In future updates that include more trials, we will assess the possibility of small study effects, including publication bias, using a funnel plot (plotting the risk ratio along the x axis versus standard error along the y axis).</P>
<P>We did not judge the possibility of selective reporting of outcomes to be a problem in most of the included trials because the two main outcomes of this review, active trachoma and <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection, were usually reported.</P>
<P>We included all trials irrespective of the language of publication, however we cannot exclude the possibility that negative trials have been published in less accessible journals (see publication bias above).</P>
<P>We did not find any evidence of multiple (duplicate) reporting publication bias. Data from one of our included trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACT-1999-The-Gambia" TYPE="STUDY">ACT 1999 The Gambia</LINK>) were published twice, with ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection being the focus of one publication and active trachoma the focus of the other, but the relationship of the data was clear from the publications.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-02-08 11:46:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>In the original review, the review authors pooled outcomes from community-based trials in which non-affected and affected cases were treated with outcomes from individual-based trials in which only affected cases were treated. The original protocol planned but did not carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of using only data from cases that were active at baseline.</P>
<P>In the update, we considered these community-based and individually randomised trials separately as they are asking different questions and are likely to be estimating different treatment effects.</P>
<P>Where appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model. If there were three trials or less we used a fixed-effect model. In cases where there was substantial heterogeneity or inconsistency, that is the individual study estimates were different sides of the null line and/or confidence intervals did not overlap, with corresponding high levels of I<SUP>2</SUP> we did not pool the results.</P>

<P>We considered type of antibiotic (oral or topical) to be a potential source of clinical heterogeneity. This subgroup analysis was not specified explicitly but was implied in the objectives of the original protocol which were to consider oral and topical antibiotics separately, in particular oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline. A further subgroup analysis considered just those trials in which communities were randomised to oral azithromycin, topical tetracycline, or both, where the antibiotic was administered using regimens consistent with WHO guidelines current in 2010, compared either to each other, placebo or no treatment.</P>

<P>There was little suggestion of selective outcome reporting. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> show the outcome reporting grid. In most cases, where an outcome was not reported it was because the study follow up was not conducted at that time point or "Not mentioned but clinical judgement says unlikely to have been measured", which is unlikely to introduce bias. Three trials did not report active trachoma. For <LINK REF="STD-Chidambaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chidambaram 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>, data on active trachoma were collected and not reported; the authors have supplied unpublished data on active trachoma for <LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>. For <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> the focus of the study was the presence of <I>C. trachomatis</I> DNA on flies and in the eyes of children, so it was plausible that a clinical assessment was not done. Nine trials (out of a total of 21 included studies) did not report ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection but there was nothing in the reports of these studies to suggest that the data had been collected and not reported. In one trial <LINK REF="STD-Cochereau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cochereau 2007</LINK> it was clear that data on ocular infection had been collected but not reported.</P>
<P>All studies (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) reported outcomes at three months. Thirteen (out of 21) trials reported outcomes at 12 months. Only one trial reported 24 months outcomes for both treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Atik-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atik 2006</LINK>), although <LINK REF="STD-Chidambaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chidambaram 2006</LINK> reported outcomes for the treated communities only at 24 months.

<P>Recruitment bias can occur when individuals are recruited to the trial after the clusters have been randomised as the knowledge of whether each cluster is an &#8216;intervention&#8217; or &#8216;control&#8217; cluster could affect the types of participants recruited (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>).None of the included studies discussed this issue. </P>
<P>When small numbers of clusters are randomised, there is a possibility of chance baseline imbalance between the randomised groups in terms of either the clusters or the individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>).This was a particular problem with the cluster-randomised trials included in this review.

<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> shows the effect of any antibiotic treatment on <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection at 12 months.

The pooled estimate of treatment effect for oral antibiotics on active trachoma at three months was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.97) and for topical antibiotics was 0.82 (0.72 to 0.92). A similar picture was seen for active trachoma at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> shows the effect of oral versus topical antibiotic on active trachoma at three months from within-trial comparisons (six trials, n = 953). There was considerable statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63%). The estimates of effect were spread across the null line with three trials reporting a beneficial effect of oral antibiotics and three trials reporting a beneficial effect of topical antibiotics. Three of the six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Darougar-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Darougar 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 1966</LINK>) had findings consistent with a hypothesis of no difference in effect.

<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1993</LINK> have not been included in the graphical analyses because they compared oral antibiotic (single-dose azithromycin) with a combination of topical/oral antibiotic (topical tetracycline with oral erythromycin for severe cases). A total of 194 people with active disease were randomly allocated to treatment, 97 in each group. Approximately 60% of these people were antigen positive at baseline. At 26 weeks 21/97 had active disease in the azithromycin group and 27/97 in the tetracycline/erythromycin group (risk ratio 0.78 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28).

The two trials reported very different results. <LINK REF="STD-Atik-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atik 2006</LINK> reported a non-significant increased risk of active trachoma in the community treated with azithromycin (risk ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.94) whereas in <LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>, communities receiving mass treatment with azithromycin had a reduced prevalence of active trachoma in children 12 months after treatment (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.52, 0.65). It is difficult to explain the differences between the two studies, however, <LINK REF="STD-Atik-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atik 2006</LINK> only compared two communities compared to the 24 randomised in <LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>.

<P>These analyses do not take into account the cluster design of the studies.

<P>Even though all three studies had the same interventions and the one study protocol there was still considerable heterogeneity of effect.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-08 11:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Trials included in this review provide evidence that individuals with trachoma benefit from antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of active trachoma and ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection up to 12 months after treatment. The trials included in this review were clinically and statistically heterogeneous and most had serious limitations in their design. This makes it difficult to estimate the size of the effect; the current best guess would be an approximate 20% risk reduction. Overall the quality of the evidence is graded as low. Oral and topical treatments appeared to have similar effects if used as prescribed (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK>) compared oral antibiotic and unsupervised topical treatment and found the oral antibiotic to be more effective "under practical operational conditions", which may have been due to poor compliance with the more complex topical treatment regimen.</P>
<P>Only three of the more recent trials in individuals used azithromycin, which is the currently recommended oral antibiotic treatment. None of these trials had a no treatment group. However, in the individually-randomised trials there was no evidence that azithromycin was less effective than topical tetracycline.</P>
<P>We identified four community-based trials comparing azithromycin versus no treatment. These trials were of variable quality and size, however there was one large, good quality trial conducted in Ethiopia (<LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>) that provided good evidence that community-based treatment with a single dose of azithromycin reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection in children up to 12 months after treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial compared oral versus topical community-based treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 4</LINK>). This study was conducted in three countries in Africa and therefore is included as three separate studies in this review. Data from this study were inconsistent. In The Gambia and Egypt there was some evidence that oral azithromycin was more effective than topical tetracycline, particularly with regards to ocular infection. However, after adjustment for the cluster design of the study these findings were not statistically significant and were not replicated consistently in the Tanzanian arm of the study.</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported any serious adverse events associated with either of the currently used antibiotics, azithromycin and topical tetracycline. However, for many of the trials it was not clear whether data on adverse effects had been collected systematically. In the one trial that did report these data, between 10% and 15% of people experienced symptoms such as nausea and vomiting with azithromycin treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:18:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>A strength of the evidence is that the included trials come from many different countries and populations. However, it is unfortunate that heterogeneity between trial results means that we cannot estimate with any confidence the size of the effect for treatment of trachoma with oral or topical antibiotics, although it is likely that both oral and topical treatments have a beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Almost all the trials in individuals were done in children and the generaliseability of these findings to adults is uncertain. In the community-based trials, data were reported for adults and children. With the small number of trials it was not possible to determine whether the effects are different in these groups but one study (<LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>) provided data on ocular infection after mass treatment in both children and adults. The observed risk ratio in children was 0.32 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.40) and in adults was 0.49 (0.33 to 0.71).</P>
<P>Evidence for community-based or mass treatment campaigns is sparse. It was not possible to determine who should be treated on the basis of available data, what the important factors are in planning treatment strategies and whether it is the whole community, all children under 10 years of age, all women and children or families of all children with active trachoma. There is some evidence that frequent treatment of children may be an effective strategy to reduce the community prevalence of infection (<LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azithromycin was given in the trials as a single, double or triple dose but it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference in effect. Where azithromycin is not donated, there is a major cost difference between topical tetracycline and oral azithromycin, but it was not possible to determine which is the more cost-effective strategy per extra case cured. Some populations in which trachoma is endemic are subject to migration and that may account in part for the low follow-up rates in the community trials; it may also have implications in determining the most effective treatment in those populations where new infected cases migrate into the community.</P>
<P>Our review does not directly address the evidence for the WHO guidelines. In part this is because we did not identify any trial data that directly tested the efficacy of the mass antibiotic administration schedules currently recommended. These are that where the baseline district-level prevalence of TF in one to nine year-old children is 10% or greater, mass antibiotic treatment should be undertaken annually for three years before a repeat district-level survey (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2006</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:20:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The included trials were published from 1966 onwards and their quality was variable. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was low, particularly for the comparison antibiotics versus no treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Reporting of sequence generation and allocation concealment was not good and it was often difficult to assess the effect of incomplete data due to inadequate reporting. There was considerable heterogeneity of results. However, masking of outcome assessment was reported for laboratory analyses (less so for clinical assessments of active trachoma) and there was little evidence of selective outcome reporting. There was moderate quality evidence for the comparison of oral and topical antibiotics for the outcome active trachoma (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The community-based trials were also of poor methodological quality with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 4</LINK>). The main problem with the included studies was that in most of the studies only two communities were randomly allocated to treatment (only two trials randomised sufficient number of clusters). Although adjustment for baseline characteristics can alleviate this problem to some extent, the interpretation of these studies is always problematic as it is difficult to exclude the alternative explanation that there is some characteristic that is different between the communities (apart from treatment of trachoma) and which may be the real cause of any observed differences in outcome. There was also little information on other potential sources of bias in cluster-randomised trials such as recruitment bias.</P>
<P>Three community-based trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chidambaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chidambaram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TANA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TANA 2009</LINK>) had a 'delayed treatment' design that involved randomly selecting clusters for treatment and comparing the prevalence of trachoma 12 months after treatment with a random selection of untreated clusters that are then enrolled in the treatment programme. This study design overcomes the ethical dilemma of surveying communities for trachoma and then withholding treatment for 12 months but has the disadvantage that baseline data on trachoma are not available in the control group.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-17 11:57:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>This update, like previous versions of the Cochrane review of antibiotics for trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Mabey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mabey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabey 2005</LINK>), found some evidence of benefit of treatment of individuals with clinical signs of active trachoma, but only limited evidence to support the use of oral azithromycin in preference to topical tetracycline. In contrast to those previous Cochrane reviews, we found some good quality evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of community-based treatment, with some limited evidence of greater benefit of mass treatment with azithromycin over mass treatment with topical tetracycline.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 11:57:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-17 11:57:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Whilst the data are not of sufficient quality to make firm conclusions, there is some evidence that people treated with either oral or topical antibiotics may experience a reduction in the risk of active trachoma (perhaps of the order of 20% relative risk reduction). It is likely that oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline have similar effects if used as prescribed.</P>
<P>Community-based trials show that mass administration of antibiotics reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection with <I>C.trachomatis. </I>There were no trial data that directly tested the mass antibiotic administration schedules currently recommended by WHO.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-17 11:57:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma has endorsed the donation of azithromycin for the treatment of trachoma. This would be an ideal setting in which to conduct community-randomised trials, under operational conditions, comparing the effect of mass distribution of azithromycin to that of placebo or no treatment.Opportunities for ethically conducting such trials occur in countries and districts newly enrolling in trachoma control programmes. Inequities are bound to exist in some settings at start-up, when antibiotics and resources for their distribution are generally in limited supply. Allocating interventions randomly in these circumstances is reasonable, with roll-out of the intervention to areas initially randomised to 'control' in later treatment rounds. Such an approach has been used in several of the trials included in this review. Trials to determine optimal dosages and dosage intervals of azithromycin at various levels of endemicity, test the most appropriate thresholds for starting and stopping mass treatment, and to determine which subgroups will need to be treated at various stages of the pathway towards elimination are also required; where potential strategies to evaluate could be selected on the basis of recent mathematical modelling work. Cost effectiveness per extra case cured should be one of the outcome measures. The adverse effects of azithromycin and emergence of resistance are also areas that should be addressed.</P>

<P>In 2011 this review was substantially revised. The major change was that we considered separately the individually-randomised and cluster-randomised trials, and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was implemented. The greater detail required in Revman 5 format has meant that we have completed some aspects of the methods - such as assessment of heterogeneity - for this update which were not discussed in detail in the original protocol.</P>

<P>The following information about the overall study aims was obtained from the trial registration information on ClinicalTrials.gov.</P>
<P>
<I>"The proposed study is a group-randomized trial to determine the frequency and treatment target of community-wide mass antibiotic treatment to eliminate trachoma. We will also study the impact of community-wide antibiotic distribution on antibiotic-resistance in pneumococcus. Communities in Goncha Siso Enese district of East Gojam Zone, Ethiopia will be randomly assigned to different treatment schemes and monitored to study the following research questions:</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Specific Aim 1. To determine whether biannual mass treatments is more likely to eliminate ocular chlamydia from hyper-endemic communities than annual mass treatments.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Specific Aim 2. To determine whether children form a core group for the transmission of trachoma.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Specific Aim 3. To determine whether latrine construction prevents the return of infection into a community after mass treatment.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Specific Aim 4. To determine the effect of mass azithromycin treatments on antibiotic resistance in pneumococcus and the reduction in mortality."</I>
</P>
<P>As at April 2010, there are two publications available from this study. House et al addresses study aim 2 but has a slightly different emphasis - <I>"Assessment of herd protection against trachoma due to repeated mass antibiotic distributions: a cluster-randomised trial"</I>.

<P>Interventions were different - oral dose of azithromycin syrup versus topical tetracycline -so not possible to prevent knowledge to caregivers and participants. However, eyes were graded by &#8220;a clinical assessor blind to the treatment allocation.&#8221; (page 4075).</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients were aware of their treatments, and therefore inadvertent unmasking of the clinical assessors at follow-up by the patients was possible. There were no reports of the occurring, however, and the similar cure rate ratios for both clinical and photographic outcome suggest that unmasking and bias were not a significant problem.&#8220; (page 4077).</P>

<P>&#8220;In order to limit the confounding factors for assessing the outcome of the initial trachoma episode, reinfection risks were strictly controlled. Person coming to the investigation centre with the affected children were to be treated with oral azithromcin. Soap was provided and villagers were informed about well-known environmental risk factors for trachoma&#8221; (<I>Randomisation procedures and treatments p668).</I>

<P>"Anorexia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea occurred in three children between the 15th and 25th days of medication.

Between day 21 and 28 of medication, transient macular rashes and one-day illness with low-grade fever and anorexia occurred in four children. Two of them had received drug, and two placebo. It is likely that an intercurrent, unrelated illness was responsible. Gross enamel dysplasia or tooth discoloration was not observed on examination 20 weeks after the end of medication."
