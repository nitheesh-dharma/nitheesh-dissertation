<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:56:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In spite of various medical and surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD), patients gradually develop significant physical problems. Physiotherapists aim to enable people with PD to maintain their maximum level of mobility, activity, and independence by monitoring their condition and targeting appropriate treatment. A range of approaches to movement rehabilitation are used, which aim to enhance quality of life by maximising physical ability and minimising problems related to Parkinson's over the whole course of the disease.</P>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. In these studies,a group of participants were given physiotherapy intervention and were compared with another group of participants, who did not receive physiotherapy. Participants were assigned to a group in random fashion so a fair test was established. Thirty-nine randomised trials involving 1827 participants were identified as suitable for this review. The quality of the trials was not high because in many, methods were not reported adequately and blinding was not feasible. These trials assessed various physiotherapy interventions, so the trials were grouped according to the type of intervention being used (i.e. general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance, or martial arts).</P>
<P>Improvement in all walking outcomes (except the 10- or 20-metre walk test) was noted with physiotherapy intervention. However, these improvements were significant only for walking speed, walking endurance, and freezing of gait. Mobility and balance also improved with a physiotherapy intervention, with significant improvements reported in one test of mobility (the Timed Up &amp; Go test, which times how long it takes a person to get up from a chair, walk a certain distance, then walk back to the chair and sit down) and in two tests of balance (one assessing how far a person can reach before he or she loses balance (Functional Reach Test) and another assessing multiple aspects of balance (Berg Balance Scale)). Clinician-rated disability, using the Unified Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), was also improved with physiotherapy intervention. No difference was observed between the two groups in falls or patient-rated quality of life. One study reported that adverse events were rare; no other studies reported data on this outcome. When the different physiotherapy interventions were compared, no evidence suggested that treatment effect differed across the physiotherapy interventions for any of the outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>This review provides evidence of the short-term benefit of physiotherapy for the treatment of PD. Although most observed differences were small, improvements in walking speed, balance with the Berg Balance Scale, and clinician-rated disability using the UPDRS were of a size that patients may consider them to be important. These benefits should be interpreted with caution because of the quality of the included trials, and the lack of common assessment of treatment effects. This affected the quantity of data that we could use for analysis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:23:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite medical therapies and surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD), patients develop progressive disability. Physiotherapy aims to maximise functional ability and minimise secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within a context of education and support for the whole person. The overall aim is to optimise independence, safety, and well-being, thereby enhancing quality of life.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:23:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified relevant trials by conducting electronic searches of numerous literature databases (e.g. MEDLINE, EMBASE) and trial registers, and by handsearching major journals, abstract books, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved publications. The literature search included trials published up to the end of January 2012.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:23:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from each article. We used standard meta-analysis methods to assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention compared with no physiotherapy intervention. Trials were classified into the following intervention comparisons: general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance, and martial arts. We used tests for heterogeneity to assess for differences in treatment effect across these different physiotherapy interventions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:51:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 39 trials with 1827 participants. We considered the trials to be at a mixed risk of bias as the result of unreported allocation concealment and probable detection bias. Compared with no intervention, physiotherapy significantly improved the gait outcomes of speed (mean difference 0.04 m/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.06, P = 0.0002); two- or six-minute walk test (13.37 m, 95% CI 0.55 to 26.20, P = 0.04) and Freezing of Gait questionnaire (-1.41, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.19, P = 0.02); functional mobility and balance outcomes of Timed Up &amp; Go test (-0.63 s, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.21, P = 0.003), Functional Reach Test (2.16 cm, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.43, P = 0.0008), and Berg Balance Scale (3.71 points, 95% CI 2.30 to 5.11, P &lt; 0.00001); and clinician-rated disability using the Unified Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (total -6.15 points, 95% CI-8.57 to -3.73, P &lt; 0.00001; activities of daily living: -1.36, 95% CI -2.41 to -0.30, P = 0.01; and motor: -5.01, 95% CI -6.30 to -3.72, P &lt; 0.00001). No difference between arms was noted in falls (Falls Efficacy Scale: -1.91 points, 95% CI -4.76 to 0.94, P = 0.19) or patient-rated quality of life (PDQ-39 Summary Index: -0.38 points, 95% CI -2.58 to 1.81, P = 0.73). One study reported that adverse events were rare; no other studies reported data on this outcome. Indirect comparisons of the different physiotherapy interventions revealed no evidence that the treatment effect differed across physiotherapy interventions for any of the outcomes assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:51:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benefit for physiotherapy was found in most outcomes over the short term (i.e. &lt; 3 months) but was significant only for speed, two- or six-minute walk test, Freezing of Gait questionnaire, Timed Up &amp; Go, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale, and clinician-rated UPDRS. Most of the observed differences between treatments were small. However, for some outcomes (e.g. speed, Berg Balance Scale, UPDRS), the differences observed were at, or approaching, what are considered minimal clinically important changes. These benefits should be interpreted with caution because the quality of most of the included trials was not high. Variation in measurements of outcome between studies meant that our analyses include a small proportion of the participants recruited.</P>
<P>This review illustrates that a wide range of approaches are employed by physiotherapists to treat patients with PD. However, no evidence of differences in treatment effect was noted between the different types of physiotherapy interventions being used, although this was based on indirect comparisons. A consensus menu of 'best practice' physiotherapy is needed, as are large, well-designed randomised controlled trials undertaken to demonstrate the longer-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 'best practice' physiotherapy in PD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:58:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Rubenis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenis 2007</LINK>) with wide reaching implications for patients and their families. Although disability can occur at all stages of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>), PD is progressive in nature, and so patients face increased difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL) (<LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2007</LINK>) and various aspects of mobility such as gait, transfers, balance, and posture (<LINK REF="STD-Keus-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Keus 2007b</LINK>). Ultimately, this leads to decreased independence, inactivity, and social isolation (<LINK REF="STD-Keus-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Keus 2007b</LINK>), resulting in reduced quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Schrag-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrag 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The management of PD has traditionally centred on drug therapy, with levodopa viewed as the 'gold standard' treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rascol-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rascol 2002</LINK>). However, even with optimal medical management, patients with PD experience deterioration in body function, daily activities, and participation (<LINK REF="REF-Nijkrake-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijkrake 2007</LINK>). For this reason, support has been increasing for the inclusion of rehabilitation therapies as an adjuvant to pharmacological and neurosurgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gage-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gage 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nijkrake-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijkrake 2007</LINK>), and a call for the move towards multidisciplinary management of this multidimensional condition (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenis 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physiotherapist is a member within this multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenis 2007</LINK>), whose purpose is to maximise functional ability and minimise secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within a context of education and support for the whole person (<LINK REF="REF-Plant-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plant 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>). Physiotherapy for PD focuses on transfers, posture, upper limb function, balance (and falls), gait, and physical capacity and (in)activity by using cueing strategies, cognitive movement strategies, and exercise to optimise the patient&#8217;s independence, safety, and well-being, thereby enhancing quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keus-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Referral rates to physiotherapy for people with PD have historically been low (<LINK REF="REF-Mutch-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutch 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yarrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarrow 1999</LINK>). However, in recent years, the number of referrals has increased, with a survey by Parkinson&#8217;s UK in 2008 reporting that 54% of the 13,000 members surveyed had seen a physiotherapist compared with 27% in a survey undertaken in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-PDS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PDS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yarrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarrow 1999</LINK>). This rise in referrals may be attributed to two factors. First, guidelines published by the National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Nat-Collab-Centre-for-Chronic-Conditions-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nat Collab Centre for Chronic Conditions 2006</LINK>) recommended that physiotherapy be made available throughout all stages of the disease, raising the profile of the profession. This has been further supported by the publication of Dutch physiotherapy guidelines (Keus 2004), which provide specific information for physiotherapists involved in the management of PD. Second, a substantial increase has been noted in the number of trials completed over the past decade (particularly in the last five years), offering supportive evidence for the inclusion of physiotherapy in the management of PD (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane review assessing the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention in patients with PD was first published in 2001, and included only 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 280 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>). Most of the trials in the review reported a positive effect in favour of physiotherapy, but few outcome measures were statistically significant. This, combined with the presence of methodological flaws, small sample sizes, and the possibility of publication bias, led Deane et al. to conclude that evidence was insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy for PD (<LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>). This review updates the previous Cochrane review. We appraised and synthesised relevant randomised controlled trials, and we conducted a meta-analysis of outcomes where possible.</P>

<P>We combined the results of all trials using standard meta-analytic methods to estimate an overall effect for physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention.</P>
<P>All outcomes with data available for meta-analysis were continuous variables, so we calculated the mean difference between treatment arms using mean difference methods (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>). In summary, this involved calculating for each trial the mean change (and standard deviation) from baseline to the postintervention time point for the intervention and no intervention groups. From these, the mean difference and its variance between arms for each trial could be calculated. In some studies, the standard deviation for the mean change was not reported; in these cases, we imputed this standard deviation using the standard deviations for baseline and final scores. To do this, we used the following formula to estimate the variance of the change in score:</P>
<P>var<SUB>
<I>diff</I>
</SUB> = var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB> + var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB> &#8211; 2r&#8730;(var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB>var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB>
<I>)</I>
</P>
<P>where var<SUB>
<I>diff</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the change score; var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the baseline score; var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the final score; and <I>r</I> is the correlation between pretreatment and post-treatment scores. We assumed a correlation co-efficient of 0.5, which is a conservative estimate, to reduce the chance of false-positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>These values were then combined using weighted mean difference methods to obtain the overall pooled estimate of the mean difference, with 95% confidence interval, for physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention (control).</P>
<P>If any trials with three or more intervention arms were identified, the following assumptions were made for the analysis:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the trial was comparing two or more physiotherapy interventions within the same classification (see subgroup analysis later) versus no intervention, then we combined the data for these physiotherapy interventions to give one comparison of physiotherapy intervention versus no intervention.</LI>
<LI>If the trial was comparing two or more physiotherapy interventions in different classifications versus no intervention, then we included that trial in each relevant physiotherapy intervention classification. This meant that some trials were included multiple times in the analysis, and the control arms from these trials were counted more than once in the analysis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The primary analysis was a comparison of physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention (control) based on change from baseline to the first assessment after the treatment period (which in most cases was immediately post intervention). This was chosen as the primary analysis for this review, as in most trials this was the main data analysis, and few trials reported data at longer-term assessment points (i.e. after six months). Also, some trials allowed participants in the 'no intervention' arm to receive physiotherapy intervention after this point. So this allowed a clean comparison of physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2013-04-15 13:15:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 76 randomised trials of physiotherapy intervention in PD patients. We excluded 31 studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The reasons for excluding these trials were as follows: cross-over study with data not presented for the first treatment period or cross-over over a short period (e.g. 1 day) (n=6), not randomised or not properly randomised (n=7), no outcome measures relevant to our review (n=4), multidisciplinary therapy rehabilitation trial (n=4), study was confounded (n=2) and treatment given in trial was not usually used by physiotherapists (n=6), excessive number of withdrawals (n=1), and insufficient information (n=1). There were also six ongoing trials for which data were not yet available (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). Therefore, 39 trials were available for inclusion in the review compared with 11 in the 2001 review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of participants randomly assigned into the 39 trials ranged from six to 153 participants, with 1827 participants randomly assigned in total (giving an average trial size of nearly 50 participants) (Characteristics of included studies). The assessment period ranged from three weeks to 12 months. The mean age of participants in the trials was 67 years, 64% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.4, and participants had had PD for approximately six years (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial compared walking on a treadmill listening to music versus walking on a treadmill without music versus listening to music alone (<LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2009</LINK>). We excluded the treadmill without music arm of this trial from the analysis as this was a confounded comparison.</P>
<P>Two three-arm trials compared two exercise interventions with control. One compared exercise versus exercise and education versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>), and the other compared exercise versus PD SAFEx versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Sage-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sage 2009a</LINK>). The exercise interventions being compared in these studies were considered suitably similar, so we combined the data from the two exercise arms within each trial to obtain one comparison of exercise versus control. Two three-arm trials compared two cueing interventions with control. The overground and treadmill walking groups, each with equally spaced transverse lines as cues, were combined to obtain a single cueing versus control comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2012</LINK>). Finger tapping and arm swing interventions were similarly combined (<LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>). One four-arm trial compared two types of dance (waltz/foxtrot and tango) and martial arts with control. We combined the two dance arms to obtain one comparison of dance versus control, as well as a martial arts versus control comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four other three-arm trials contributed data to two of the different physiotherapy intervention comparisons. Two of these were trials of cueing versus exercise versus control, which contributed to both the cueing versus control and exercise versus control comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1996</LINK>). Another trial was of treadmill versus general physiotherapy versus control, which contributed to both the treadmill versus control and general physiotherapy versus control comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK>). The last trial, which provided no analysable data, contributed information to two comparisons: general physiotherapy versus control and treadmill versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>). The 39 trials therefore contributed data to 44 comparisons within the six different types of physiotherapy interventions &#65293; general physiotherapy versus control (n=7), exercise versus control (n=14), treadmill versus control (n=8), cueing versus control (n=9), dance versus control (n=2), and martial arts versus control (n=4).</P>
<P>Below is a summary of the characteristics of included studies. Details of individual studies are given in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>General Physiotherapy versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The seven trials of general physiotherapy versus control involved 244 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keus-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Keus 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>)). Sixty participants split between physiotherapy and treadmill categories are not included in this total as the group splits were not given (<LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>). The mean participant age was 65 years, 69% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.4, and mean duration of PD was four years. All trials were of parallel group design, except one, which used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2005</LINK>). Treatment sessions took place over a period of four weeks to 12 months; duration of sessions was described by only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 2012</LINK>). One trial used Bobath training for gait and posture (<LINK REF="STD-Homann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homann 1998</LINK>). The remaining trials provided multifaceted interventions encompassing movement strategies, exercise, hands-on techniques, education, and advice, targeting a wide range of areas including gait, balance, transfers, posture, and physical fitness. Thus, general physiotherapy is a holistic intervention and on the whole uses a combination of techniques that do not routinely include complementary and/or alternative medicine such as acupuncture or hypnotherapy.</P>
<P>
<I>Exercise versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The 14 trials of exercise versus control involved 769 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cerri-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cerri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sage-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sage 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schenkman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schenkman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schilling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stozek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stozek 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taheri-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taheri 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1996</LINK>). The mean participant age was 69 years, 60% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.6, and mean duration of PD was six years. Thirteen trials were of parallel group design, and one used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2011</LINK>). Treatment sessions lasted from 30 minutes to two hours, and took place over a period of three to 24 weeks. Exercise involved a variety of different activities, including strengthening and balance training, walking, falls prevention, neuromuscular facilitation, resistance exercise and aerobic training, and education and relaxation techniques. Although sometimes multifaceted, the primary focus of these interventions was exercise delivery, and treatment was frequently categorised in this way by the trial authors.</P>
<P>
<I>Treadmill versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The eight trials of treadmill versus control involved 179 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cakit-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cakit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canning-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Canning 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganesan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ganesan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtais-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtais 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Protas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Protas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>). Sixty participants split between physiotherapy and treadmill categories are not included in this total, as the group splits were not given (<LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>). The mean participant age was 68 years, 61% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.4, and mean duration of PD was five years. All trials used a parallel group design. Treatment sessions lasted from 30 to 60 minutes, and took place over a period of four to eight weeks. Treadmill training mainly involved participants walking on a treadmill with speed and/or incline adjustments. Three trials used body weight-supported treadmill training (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganesan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ganesan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>), and two trials provided gait and step training (<LINK REF="STD-Kurtais-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtais 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Protas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Protas 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Cueing versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The nine trials of cueing versus control involved 371 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieuwboer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nieuwboer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1996</LINK>). The mean participant age was 67 years, 59% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.6, and mean duration of PD was seven years. Eight of the trials were of parallel group design, and one used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Nieuwboer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nieuwboer 2007</LINK>). Treatment sessions lasted from four to 30 minutes and took place over a period of a single session to 13 weeks. Three types of cueing were used in the trials: audio (music, spoken instructions), visual (computer images), and sensory (vibration). Six trials applied external cues during gait or gait-related activity, and Mak (<LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>) used cues for the rehabilitation of sit-to-stand transfers.</P>
<P>
<I>Dance versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The two trials of dance versus control involved 120 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>). The mean participant age was 69 years, 63% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.3, and mean duration of PD was seven years. Both trials used a parallel group design. Dance classes lasted one hour over 12 to 13 weeks, with a trained instructor teaching participants the tango, waltz, or foxtrot.</P>
<P>
<I>Martial Arts versus Control</I>
</P>
<P>The four trials of martial arts versus control involved 143 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marjama_x002d_Lyons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marjama-Lyons 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz_x002d_Hubsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz-Hubsch 2006</LINK>). The mean participant age was 65 years, 74% were male, the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage was 2.1, and mean duration of PD was six years. All the trials were of parallel group design, except one, which used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>). Treatment lasted one hour and took place over a period of 12 to 24 weeks. Participants took classes on Tai Chi (three trials; <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marjama_x002d_Lyons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marjama-Lyons 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>) or Qigong (one trial; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz_x002d_Hubsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz-Hubsch 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<I>Trial Design</I>
</P>
<P>Thirty-five trials had a parallel design and four had a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieuwboer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nieuwboer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>). The cross-over trials had no washout period, with participants assessed at baseline, after the first treatment period, and then after the second treatment period. Most trials looked at the short-term effect of therapy by assessing participants at baseline and immediately or shortly after the physiotherapy intervention period (which ranged from two to 52 weeks). Ten of the parallel design trials (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz_x002d_Hubsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz-Hubsch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stozek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stozek 2003</LINK>) reported additional data at assessment points after the treatment period had finished; this may have been at only one week or up to 12 months after the end of the treatment period.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample Size</I>
</P>
<P>Only six studies (15%; <LINK REF="STD-Allen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieuwboer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nieuwboer 2007</LINK>) reported a sample size calculation in the trial report, three of which failed to achieve their target (<LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Eligibility Criteria</I>
</P>
<P>Eligibility criteria for the trials were broad and varied considerably across trials. The level of detail provided in the eligibility criteria was also variable, with some studies providing a detailed description of the entry criteria, and others just stating &#8220;patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#8221; Only eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cakit-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cakit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keus-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Keus 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieuwboer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nieuwboer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz_x002d_Hubsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz-Hubsch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 2012</LINK>) stated that a diagnosis of PD by the United Kingdom Brain Bank Criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1988</LINK>) was required. It is vital that eligibility criteria are well defined, so that the trial participant population can be determined.</P>
<P>
<I>Randomisation Method and Concealment of Allocation</I>
</P>
<P>Only 18 trials (46%) described the randomisation method used, of which 11 trials used low-risk methods (e.g. block randomisation, computer random number generators). No details on the randomisation method used were provided for the remaining 21 trials. Further, only 14 trials (36%) stated or gave adequate information that allowed the assessment of whether an adequate concealment of treatment allocation procedure had been used. Five trials were considered to be low risk by virtue of the fact that they used a central randomisation service, and the other nine were considered high risk (i.e. concealment of treatment allocation was potentially compromised &#65293; sealed envelopes, picking card or picking from a hat).</P>
<P>
<I>Blinding of Assessors</I>
</P>
<P>It would be impossible to blind participants and therapists to randomised treatment allocation in trials of physiotherapy. Therefore, such trials are open label by nature, and are consequently liable to the possibility of both performance and attrition bias. However, assessors could be blinded to try to reduce the possibility of bias. Twenty-four (62%) of the thirty-nine studies used blinded assessors (although in one study, the assessors correctly guessed the treatment allocation in nearly 30% of patients; unclear risk; Ashburn 2007), three used unblinded assessors so were classed as high risk, and in the other 12 studies, this information was not provided (classed as unclear risk).</P>
<P>
<I>Description of the No Intervention (Control) Group</I>
</P>
<P>In most trials (n=34), the control group did not receive any physiotherapy treatment or intervention; however, in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ashburn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ashburn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2009</LINK>), an active placebo was used that attempted to control for the time and attention involved in receiving physiotherapy intervention compared with no treatment. This included contact with a PD nurse, education classes, advice on falls prevention, and listening to music. The control groups were followed-up and were assessed in the same manner as the intervention groups.</P>
<P>
<I>Cointerventions</I>
</P>
<P>Information on cointerventions was provided in 23 trials (59%), with participants continuing with their standard PD medication. In 16 trials, this drug therapy was kept stable (low risk) throughout the duration of the trial, whereas seven trials allowed variation (unclear risk). The remaining 16 trials did not describe drug therapy (unclear risk).</P>
<P>
<I>Similarity of Treatment Groups at Baseline</I>
</P>
<P>A description of the baseline characteristics of the trial participants is important for determination of whether the trial results are generalisable and for comparison of the characteristics of the two arms to ensure that the randomisation methods were successful.</P>
<P>Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganesan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ganesan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marjama_x002d_Lyons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marjama-Lyons 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taheri-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taheri 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>) did not provide any information on the baseline characteristics of participants entered into the trial. Twenty-eight (of the 33) trials that reported baseline data gave this information split by treatment group and showed participants to be similar at baseline. In ten trials; the baseline characteristics of the withdrawn participants were not given (<LINK REF="STD-Cakit-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cakit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtais-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtais 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sage-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Sage 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schenkman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schenkman 1998</LINK>). This, along with the six studies that did not supply baseline data, meant that 261 (14%) of the 1827 randomly assigned participants were not characterised.</P>
<P>
<I>Data Analysis</I>
</P>
<P>Nine trials stated intention-to-treat as the primary method of analysis, although it was not always clear if patients who withdrew from the trial were included in the analysis. The number of patient withdrawals was classed as low risk (&#8804; 10% of trial participants withdrew) in seven of these nine trials. Three trials stated per protocol as the primary method of analysis. In the other 27 trials, the method of analysis was not described (unclear risk). Of these trials, 12 were considered high risk in terms of the proportion of patients that withdrew (i.e. &gt; 10%), and in 14 trials, the number of participant withdrawals (if any) was not given (unclear risk). </P>
<P>
<I>Data Available for Analysis</I>
</P>
<P>Thirteen trials were reported in abstract form. We requested further information from authors; six (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purchas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purchas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2008</LINK>;) provided additional information, and seven (<LINK REF="STD-Cerri-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cerri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bruin-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">de Bruin 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganesan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ganesan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marjama_x002d_Lyons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marjama-Lyons 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Talakad 2011</LINK>) requests were unsuccessful. Sufficient data were available for meta-analysis for five of the 13 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 2009</LINK>). Further, one trial had relevant data that could not be extracted as it was available only in graph form (<LINK REF="STD-Lehman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 2005</LINK>), and another trial published only median and interquartile range data, so their results could not be meta-analysed in this format (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 2012</LINK>). Therefore data were not available for meta-analysis for ten trials, meaning that of the 39 trials, data available for analysis were provided by 29 trials.</P>

<I>Two- or Six-Minute Walk Test (m)</I>
</P>
<P>Data on the two- or six-minute walk test were available from six trials for seven comparisons within four physiotherapy interventions (exercise, treadmill, dance, and martial arts). (Note: <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK> contributed data to both the dance and martial arts comparisons.) Two hundred forty-two participants were included in this analysis. A benefit of borderline significance was identified, along with a greater increase in the distance walked in two or six minutes with physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention (mean difference 13.37 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 26.20; P = 0.04; see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). No evidence of heterogeneity was found between the individual trials (P = 0.44, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), nor did evidence suggest that the treatment effect differed across the four physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.19, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 37%).</P>
<P>
<I>10- or 20-Metre Walk Test(s)</I>
</P>
<P>Data on the 10- or 20-metre walk test were available from four trials for two physiotherapy interventions (exercise and treadmill). One hundred sixty-nine participants were included in the analysis. Borderline significance was reported in favour of no intervention for the time taken to walk 10 or 20 metres (0.40 s, CI 0.00 to 0.80; P = 0.05; see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). No evidence of heterogeneity between individual trials was obtained (P = 0.19, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 38%), nor did evidence indicate that the treatment effect differed across the two physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.51, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>
<I>Speed (m/s)</I>

<I>Step Length (m) </I>
</P>
<P>Data on step length were available from five trials for six comparisons within four physiotherapy interventions (general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill, and cueing). (Note: <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2008</LINK> contributed data to both the general physiotherapy and treadmill comparisons.) Three hundred eighty-three participants were included in this analysis. No difference in step length was noted between the two treatment arms (0.02 m, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.04; P = 0.06).</P>
<P>
<I>Freezing of Gait Questionnaire</I>
</P>
<P>Data from the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire were available from four trials for three physiotherapy interventions (exercise, cueing, and dance). Two hundred ninety-eight participants were included in this analysis. A borderline significant benefit was noted, with freezing of gait questionnaire score improved by 1.4 points with a physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention (-1.41, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.19; P = 0.02, see <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). No evidence of heterogeneity between the individual trials was found (P = 0.74, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), nor was there any evidence of heterogeneity between the different types of physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.55, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>

<P>
<I>Timed Up &amp; Go (s)</I>
</P>
<P>Data on the Timed Up &amp; Go test were available from nine trials for ten comparisons within four physiotherapy interventions (exercise, cueing, dance, and martial arts). (Note: <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK> contributed data to both the dance and martial arts comparisons.) Six hundred thirty-nine participants were included in this analysis. Overall, the time taken to complete the Timed Up &amp; Go test was significantly improved (i.e. reduced) with physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention (-0.63 s, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.21; P = 0.003; see <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). No heterogeneity was observed between the individual trials (P = 0.12, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 36%), nor between the four physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.33, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 12%). </P>
<P>The results for the Hackney et al. martial arts comparison were heavily weighted in the analysis (48.8%) by very small standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK>) compared with the other studies. It was also noted that in the trial publication, a nonsignificant (P = 0.093) effect of martial arts intervention was reported &#65293; a finding that contrasted with our data analysis, which reported a significant improvement (P = 0.003). The author was contacted to check whether the data reported in the paper were in fact standard errors, but they were confirmed as standard deviations. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis to remove this study and found that the overall result became not significant (-0.38 s, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.21; P = 0.21), so this result should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>
<I>Functional Reach Test (cm)</I>
</P>
<P>Data on the Functional Reach Test were available from four trials for two physiotherapy interventions (exercise and cueing). Three hundred ninety-three participants were included in this analysis. Functional reach was significantly improved with physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention (2.16 cm, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.43; P = 0.0008, see <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). No evidence suggested heterogeneity between the individual trials (P = 0.15, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44%), nor did evidence indicate that the treatment effect differed across the two physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.48, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>

<P>Data on the Berg Balance Scale were available from five trials for six comparisons within four physiotherapy interventions (exercise, treadmill, dance, and martial arts). (Note: <LINK REF="STD-Hackney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hackney 2009</LINK> contributed data to both the dance and martial arts comparisons.) Three hundred eighty-five participants were included in this analysis.

No evidence of heterogeneity between the individual trials was noted (P = 0.06, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 53%), nor did evidence suggest that the treatment effect differed across the four physiotherapy interventions (P = 0.47, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>
<I>Activity-Specific Balance Confidence</I>
</P>
<P>Data on activity-specific balance confidence were available from three trials for two physiotherapy interventions (exercise and cueing). Sixty-six participants were included in this analysis.

Nevertheless, most of the individual trials reported a general trend for a reduction in the number of falls with intervention. However, when compared with the no intervention arm, this finding was not significant, except in one trial. <LINK REF="STD-Marjama_x002d_Lyons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marjama-Lyons 2002</LINK> reported a significant decrease in the chance of fall frequency with Tai Chi intervention when compared with no intervention.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-15 13:40:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates the previous Cochrane review published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>) comparing physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention for the treatment of PD. The review now includes 39 randomised trials and 1827 participants (compared with 11 trials and 280 participants in the 2001 review). It also compares the different types of physiotherapy interventions used in the treatment of PD, thus providing a comprehensive assessment of physiotherapy treatment. Many recent systematic reviews have focused on specific areas of physiotherapy such as exercise and cueing (<LINK REF="REF-Crizzle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crizzle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nieuwboer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwboer 2008</LINK>). Nowadays, physiotherapy for PD encompasses a wide range of methods and techniques ranging from standard NHS physiotherapy to exercise regimens and martial arts. Therefore, it is important that all forms of physiotherapy intervention are included, so that the true benefit (if any) of physiotherapy can be assessed. The review also includes a more comprehensive range of outcome measures compared with previous reviews (18 outcomes assessing gait, functional mobility and balance, falls, clinician-rated Unified Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and patient-rated quality of life), thus providing the most reliable summary available of the current published evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Physiotherapy Intervention versus No Physiotherapy Intervention</B>
</P>
<P>This review provides evidence of the short-term (&lt; three months) benefit of physiotherapy in the treatment of PD. All outcomes showed improvement with physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention (except the 10- or 20-metre walk test). However, significant benefits after physiotherapy intervention were observed only for the gait outcomes of speed, the two- or six-minute walk test, and the Freezing of Gait questionnaire; the functional and mobility outcomes of the Timed Up &amp; Go test, Functional Reach Test, and Berg Balance Scale; and the clinician-rated UPDRS. It is of interest that the direction of the treatment effect favoured physiotherapy intervention in all outcome measures, except one. The absence of evidence in these outcomes is not necessarily evidence of the absence of benefit for physiotherapy. One possible reason for this may be the lack of data. More than 1800 participants were randomly assigned into the 39 trials included in this review, and 29 trials and 1577 participants (86% of total) provided data for analysis. However, the greatest quantity of data were provided for analysis of the outcome speed, and this included just 15 trials and 814 participants (52% of the total number of participants providing data). This general lack of extractable data means that results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>
<I>Gait</I>
</P>
<P>People with PD frequently have problems with gait, and treatment is usually targeted toward maximising exercise tolerance, improving the gait pattern, maintaining or increasing independence regarding mobility, and reducing the risk of falls. The most significant improvement among the outcomes assessing gait involved speed. In light of previous experimental evidence, it may be hypothesised that the improvement in speed is linked to an increase in step or stride length, or both, and that this in turn leads to a compensatory decrease in cadence (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1996</LINK>). In this review, although a significant improvement in speed was observed, we found no difference in step length, stride length, or cadence. This could again be due to lack of data, as a smaller number of studies reported step and stride length and cadence (up to seven studies) compared with speed (15 studies). Thus, further data on the possible link between speed, cadence, step, and stride length are required.</P>
<P>Freezing of gait is a prevalent motor disturbance within PD, and it is known to have a detrimental impact on quality of life, as well as on gait and mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2007</LINK>). We found a borderline significant difference in scores derived from the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, but this was measured in only four trials (298 participants), again highlighting the need for further data in this important area.</P>
<P>Observed differences in the three significant gait outcomes (speed, the two- or six-minute walk test, and freezing of gait) were relatively small. Therefore, their relevance and benefit to patients with PD must be put into context in terms of what is considered a minimally clinically important change (MCIC). Speed was significantly improved with physiotherapy intervention by 0.04 metres/s. Data on what is considered an MCIC are lacking for PD patients, but some data have been reported in stroke patients. In one study, it was reported that an increase in speed of just 0.03 and 0.13 metres/s could translate into a change from a limited household to an unlimited household walker, and from an unlimited household walker to a most-limited community walker, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1995</LINK>). Our data are consistent with the findings reported by Perry (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1995</LINK>). For the two- or six-minute walk test and freezing of gait, participants who received physiotherapy intervention were able to walk further over two or six minutes (by 13 m) and their Freezing of Gait score was improved by 1.4 points. Data on the MCIC are lacking for these outcomes, but although a 13-m increase in distance walked would probably be considered clinically important, the importance of a 1.4-point improvement in freezing of gait is less clear.</P>
<P>
<I>Functional Mobility and Balance</I>
</P>
<P>Changes in functional mobility and balance within PD have been well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Bloem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloem 2001</LINK>). Of the functional mobility and balance outcomes assessed within this review, significant improvements were observed in the Timed Up &amp; Go test, Functional Reach Test, and Berg Balance Scale. The time taken to complete the Timed Up &amp; Go test was significantly improved by 0.63 seconds with physiotherapy. Despite this significant change, the MCIC in PD patients is thought to be 11 seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Steffen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 2008</LINK>). Therefore, the small change observed within this review may not translate into a noticeable improvement in a person&#8217;s functional mobility.</P>
<P>A five-point change is the MCIC on the Berg Balance Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Steffen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 2008</LINK>). In this review, a significant four-point improvement in the Berg Balance Scale was noted after physiotherapy intervention. A greater evidence base is required to support or refute the clinical significance of this result. A significant improvement of 2 cm was also noted in the Functional Reach Test, but this is somewhat lower than the MCIC of 9 cm and 7 cm for the forward and backward Functional Reach Test (<LINK REF="REF-Steffen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Falls</I>
</P>
<P>Falls are a common and disabling problem within PD (<LINK REF="REF-Bloem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloem 2001</LINK>), with high clinical impact and serious cost implications to society. They are also a recurrent problem, with up to 51% of those falling reporting two or more falls per year (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2002</LINK>). Fear of falling has been recognised as a contributing factor to recurrent falls (<LINK REF="REF-Mak-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mak 2009</LINK>). Within this review, fear of falling has been captured through the Falls Efficacy Scale (standard and international). No difference between treatment arms was observed for this outcome. This might be attributed to the small number of trials (and therefore participants) included within these analyses, but could also indicate that an improvement in balance does not automatically result in increased confidence in an individual&#8217;s ability not to fall. In turn, it could be hypothesised that improvement in balance does not directly equate to improved levels of mobility and independence. Although fear of falling was not reduced with physiotherapy within this review, it would be of interest to assess whether the number of falls was reduced, as this may be more relevant to patients. Unfortunately, data on this were poorly reported and were measured too variably within the trials; therefore, they could not be meta-analysed. However, in the seven trials in which data on the number of falls were reported, a general trend toward a reduction in the number of falls with physiotherapy intervention was seen, but with no difference between the two treatment arms.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinician-Rated Disability</I>
</P>
<P>Significant improvements after physiotherapy intervention were also observed for the clinician-rated UPDRS (total, ADL, and motor scores). The UPDRS total score was improved by 6.2 points, the ADL score by 1.4 points, and motor score by 5.0 points. The MCIC for the UPDRS have been reported in two studies. One analysed data from two independent randomised controlled trials and concluded the MCIC to be eight points for the UPDRS total score, between two and three points for the ADL score, and five points for the motor score (Schrag 2006). The second study performed a cross-sectional analysis on 653 PD participants, and reported MCIC of 2.3 to 2.7 points for motor and 4.1 to 4.5 points for total UPDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 2010</LINK>). If the recommendations of both Schrag (<LINK REF="REF-Schrag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrag 2006</LINK>) and Shulman et al (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 2010</LINK>) are taken into account, it can be concluded that the significant improvements observed within this review are approaching or are MCICs (the MCICs for the UPDRS total, ADL, and motor scores lie within the confidence interval). This suggests that physiotherapy intervention is beneficial in improving motor symptoms and may positively impact ADL.</P>
<P>
<I>Patient-Rated Quality of Life</I>
</P>
<P>No significant benefit of physiotherapy intervention for overall patient-rated quality of life (measured using the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 Summary Index) or the mobility domain of the PDQ-39 was noted, which is surprising in light of the significant improvements seen in UPDRS scores. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1999</LINK>) assessed patient quality of life using the generic Short Form-36 and also showed no effect of physiotherapy intervention.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<B>Comparison of Different Physiotherapy Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>Although we found short-term benefit for physiotherapy intervention in the treatment of PD, what is less clear is whether a certain type of physiotherapy intervention may provide greater benefit. This information would be of interest to both clinicians and patients, so that appropriate physiotherapy interventions that provide greater benefit can be delivered to patients with PD. To assess this, we categorised the various physiotherapy interventions used in the trials included in this review according to the type of treatment administered, and then compared them using tests for heterogeneity. We found no real evidence of any differences in the treatment effect between the different physiotherapy interventions used for any of the outcomes assessed. However, these were based on indirect comparisons (with limited data within each physiotherapy intervention) so should be interpreted with caution. They would be better assessed in trials directly comparing different types of physiotherapy interventions.</P>
<P>This lack of difference between the different types of physiotherapy intervention is perhaps not surprising. The content and delivery of the interventions used in the trials included within this review are diverse in nature and, although attempts were made to compare trials 'like for like' through the creation of different categories, the interventions delivered varied substantially within these categories. The variety in the therapies delivered is perhaps not surprising. By nature physiotherapists are autonomous professionals with differing sets of skills who work within their own scope of practice (<LINK REF="REF-Chartered-Society-of-Physiotherapy" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</LINK>), and so this variation in the interventions delivered within clinical trials may actually reflect clinical practice. Second, and perhaps more important, PD is recognised as a complex condition with an individualised presentation (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Marck-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Marck 2009</LINK>). For this reason, Morris et al (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2010</LINK>) recognises the importance of the physiotherapist's understanding the specific experience of PD in each patient, and advocates that treatment is tailored to fit the individual&#8217;s complaints, lifestyle, and personal interests, as opposed to a 'one size fits all' approach. Over the past decade, steps have been taken to try to provide best practice consensus in the form of the Dutch <I>KNGF guidelines for physical therapy in patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2004</LINK>). However, this publication provides a guidance framework rather than a 'recipe' for treatment. It is therefore important that physiotherapy interventions are compared against each other within rigorous trial designs to determine which are most effective. This will provide therapists with a menu of treatment strategies that are known to be effective, from which they can devise individualised interventions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-04-15 13:42:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Improvement in trial methodological quality and reporting has been noted since the last Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Deane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deane 2001a</LINK>). The use of more robust randomisation methods, blinding, and intention-to-treat analyses had increased since the previous review but was still inadequate. Only 18 of the 39 trials provided information on the randomisation method (of which eleven were considered low risk), and only five used a central randomisation procedure to ensure concealment of treatment allocation. Twenty-four used blinded assessors and nine reported using intention-to-treat analysis. The lack of information on this in many trial reports may not necessarily indicate lack of implementation within the trial, but without this information, the level of bias within the individual trials is difficult to assess. This does, therefore, reduce the amount of confidence that can be placed in the results of this meta-analysis. The need for further improvement in the methodological quality of trials in physiotherapy for PD was noted in another recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2007</LINK>). Future trials need to ensure that their designs fulfil the requirements of a methodologically sound, large, randomised controlled trial, and that the reporting follows the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials included in the review were relatively small, with most assessing the effects of physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention over a short period with limited follow-up. The overall size of trials has increased (with an average of 46 participants per trial in this review compared with 25 in the previous review), but the number of small and underpowered trials remains a problem. Small trials may be subject to &#8216;random error&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Doll-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 1980</LINK>), and consequently may give rise to false-negative or -positive results. To highlight this point, this review illustrates that any differences observed in the various outcome measures showing benefit for physiotherapy were quite small. So trials need to be large enough to detect these small but possibly clinically important differences.</P>
<P>Further, it must be noted that only 14 of the 39 trials discussed participant compliance. This is surprising in that compliance can be an important determinant of the outcomes measured in trials. Therefore, it would be beneficial if the level of compliance is measured in future trials.</P>
<P>Another limitation is that the follow-up period in the trials included in this review was relatively short. Outcome measures were assessed by all trials at baseline and immediately or shortly after intervention had ceased (one or two weeks with one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2009</LINK>) assessing at 10 weeks post intervention). Thus, this review is able to provide conclusions only on the short-term benefits of physiotherapy. It is also important to consider results alongside the possibility of a so-called honeymoon effect (<LINK REF="REF-Goetz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetz 2008</LINK>) in the period during or just after physiotherapy, which may inflate the treatment effect in favour of physiotherapy. Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a long-term neurodegenerative disease, so it is important that the long-term effect of treatment be assessed. Only 12 of the 39 trials followed-up participants and reported further data during the post-treatment period (but this could have been only one week or up to six months post the treatment period). The recommendations of the previous review were that participants should be followed-up for at least six months, but only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schmitz_x002d_Hubsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz-Hubsch 2006</LINK>) reported follow-up data at six months post treatment completion. Long-term data will provide valuable information about the duration of any improvement following therapy.</P>
<P>The outcome measures included in this review are standard physiotherapy and PD outcomes. However, PD is a multidimensional disease, and many important outcomes were poorly reported or were not reported, this includes data on the number of falls, depression and anxiety, adverse events, and the health of the caregiver supporting the person with PD. Further, no health economics analysis of physiotherapy intervention was reported; therefore little is known about the cost-effectiveness and economic value of this therapy. Future trials should include these outcomes.</P>
<P>In summary, this review provides evidence of the short-term (&lt; three months) benefit of physiotherapy intervention for the treatment of PD. It is important to note that although most of the observed differences between the two treatments were small, the improvements observed for speed, Berg Balance Scale, and UPDRS scores were at levels considered to be of clinical importance. To clarify the long-term (if any) benefit of physiotherapy, additional large, well-designed randomised trials with a follow-up of at least 12 months, alongside a health economics assessment, are needed to assess the impact of this treatment on all aspects of a patient's PD. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-04-15 13:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physiotherapy provides short-term benefit in the treatment of PD. Significant benefits with physiotherapy intervention were observed for the following outcomes: two- or six-minute walk test, speed, Freezing of Gait questionnaire, Timed Up &amp; Go test, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale, and UPDRS total, ADL, and motor scores. Although most of the observed differences between the two treatment arms were small, the improvements seen for speed, Berg Balance Scale, and UPDRS scores occurred at levels that may be considered to be of clinical importance. These benefits should be interpreted with caution, however, because the quality of most of the included trials was not high.</P>
<P>The long-term, if any, benefit of physiotherapy remains unidentified, as does which type of physiotherapy intervention should be delivered. Therefore, although this review has provided evidence that physiotherapy intervention may be of benefit to PD patients, it has also highlighted that further evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be made on the long-term benefit and on which physiotherapy intervention should be used.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-15 13:43:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the studies in this review were small and had a short follow-up period. It is clear that larger randomised controlled trials are required, particularly focusing on improving trial methodology and reporting. Rigorous methods of randomisation should be used and the allocation adequately concealed. Data should be analysed according to intention-to-treat principles, and trials should be reported according to the guidelines set out in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large variety of outcome measures were assessed in these trials, but data were sufficient only for meta-analysis to be performed for eighteen outcomes. This variation in outcome selection and lack of extractable data resulted in a small proportion of included trials contributing to each outcome. This review illustrates the need for the universal employment of relevant, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures. Additionally, only one trial looked at the longer-term benefit of physiotherapy intervention. To assess whether, or how long, any improvements due to physiotherapy intervention may last, it is important that long-term follow-up is performed.</P>
<P>No evidence indicates the best form of physiotherapy intervention. Comparisons of the different physiotherapy interventions described in this review were based on indirect comparisons between individual trials. A more reliable comparison would be obtained in large, randomised trials that directly compare different physiotherapy interventions.</P>
<P>This review highlights the variety of physiotherapy interventions being used in the treatment of PD. More specific trials with improved treatment strategies are needed to underpin the most appropriate choice of physiotherapy intervention and the outcomes measured.</P>

<P>Treadmill: 8-Week exercise program using incremental speed-dependent treadmill training. Programme comprised stretching, range of motion exercise, and treadmill training. The treadmill session lasted for 30 minutes and participants were observed during treadmill training by a physiatrist, who gave no assistance in the actual performance of the movements. Maximum tolerated walking speed was determined before the training session began. This speed then was halved and was used for a 5-minute warm-up period. After the warm-up period, the belt speed was increased by increments of 0.6 km/h every 5 minutes. When the belt speed was increased to the highest speed at which the participant could walk safely and without stumbling, this maximum-achieved belt speed was maintained for 5 minutes and then was followed by 0.6-km/h decrements. The participant maintained the rest of the treadmill session at this speed for 15 minutes.</P>

<P>Although this trial was designed as an RCT, after discussion with the authors it was discovered that the method of randomisation was compromised. 'In order of response to advertising, subjects were allocated alternately to group A (period of exercise, then no exercise) and group B (control, then complimentary exercise classes).' Although alternate allocation is an acceptable method of randomisation, the authors went on to change participants from group A to B if their personal circumstances dictated that they would be unavailable for the physiotherapy (e.g. if they were leaving the state on holiday). We feel that this compromised the randomisation procedure, and therefore excluded the trial.</P>
