<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-21 21:13:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1960s, in North America and most of Europe, large psychiatric hospitals have been closed and small local hospital units established. Medical opinion as to whether people with mental illness should stay in hospital for months and years or just a few weeks has changed. Care in the community has been helped by the advent of medication for people with mental illness. Consequently, in the developed world, hospital stays are now relatively short and large psychiatric hospitals or asylums have almost disappeared. However, there is still some doubt about whether short admissions are good because the person does not get institutionalised, or harmful because the causes and symptoms of the illness are not completely addressed. This is further complicated because there are patients who have short but frequent admissions (&#8216;revolving door patients&#8217;) in contrast to others who despite treatment stay in hospital for a long time (&#8216;new long stay patients&#8217;).</P>
<P>The review aims to determine what length of stay in hospital is the most helpful and is now based on a 2012 search. Six randomised trials are included that compare short stay in hospital with either long stay in hospital or standard care. No differences were found between groups in readmission to hospital, mental state, leaving the study early, risk of death and people lost to follow-up. There was a significant difference favouring short-stay hospitalisation for social functioning. There was limited information that suggested that short-stay hospitalisation does not encourage a &#8216;revolving door&#8217; pattern of admission to hospital and disjointed or poor care.</P>
<P>This should reassure people with mental illness coming into hospital that a short stay (of less than 28 days) means they are no more likely to be readmitted, to leave hospital abruptly, or to lose contact with services after leaving hospital than if they received long-stay care. Short-stay patients are also more likely to leave hospital on their planned discharge date and possibly have a greater chance of finding employment. For psychiatrists, policy makers and health professionals it is important to know that short-stay hospitalisation does not lead to a &#8216;revolving door&#8217; pattern of admission to hospital and poor or fragmented care.</P>
<P>However, all evidence in this review was rated by the review authors to be low quality. More large, well-designed and well-reported trials are justified that focus on important outcomes such as death, self-harm, harm to others, employment, criminal behaviour, mental state, satisfaction with treatment and services, homelessness, social or family relationships and costs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In high-income countries, over the last three decades, the length of hospital stays for people with serious mental illness has reduced drastically although considerable variation remains. In lower-income countries this variation may be greater. Some argue that reduction in hospital stay leads to 'revolving door admissions' and worsening mental health outcomes despite apparent cost savings, whilst others suggest longer stays may be more harmful by institutionalising people to hospital care.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-15 10:23:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six relevant trials undertaken between 1969 and 1980. We found no significant difference in death (n = 175, 1 RCT, RR in the longer term 0.42, CI 0.10 to 1.83, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). In the long term, there was no difference in improvement of mental state (n = 61, 1 RCT, RR 3.39, CI 0.76 to 15.02, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). There was no difference in readmission to hospital (n = 651, 4 RCTs, RR by the long term 1.26, CI 1.00 to 1.57, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Data for leaving the study prematurely by the longer term showed no difference (n = 229, 2 RCTs, (RR 0.77, CI 0.34 to 1.77, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was a significant difference favouring short stay (P = 0.01) in numbers of participants with delayed discharge from hospital exceeding the time planned in study (n = 404, 3 RCTs, RR in the longer term 0.54, CI 0.33 to 0.88, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was no difference in numbers of participants lost to follow-up (n = 404, 3 RCTs, RR by the longer term 1.07, CI 0.70 to 1.62, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Finally, there was a significant difference favouring short-stay hospitalisation for social functioning, including unemployment, unable to housekeep, or unknown employment status (n = 330, 2 RCTs, RR by longer term 0.61, CI 0.50 to 0.76, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of hospital care and the length of stay is important for mental health policy. We found limited low and very low quality data which were all over 30 years old. Outcomes from these studies do suggest that a planned short-stay policy does not encourage a 'revolving door' pattern of admission and disjointed care for people with serious mental illness. More large, well-designed and reported trials are justified especially where a short-stay policy is not routine care.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In Europe, hospital provision for mentally ill people dates back over eight hundred years. These were frequently overcrowded and included provision for the 'poor'. The distinction between 'pauper' and 'lunatic' only began to be recognised by the eighteenth century. At the turn of the nineteenth century growing public concern about mental illness led to greater provision of asylums and restrictive custodial care. This was off-set, however, by a liberal movement called 'Moral Treatment', pioneered in France (<LINK REF="REF-Pinel-1806" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinel 1806</LINK>) and England (<LINK REF="REF-Tuke-1813" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuke 1813</LINK>). This approach favoured releasing people who were physically restrained into bigger asylums (<LINK REF="REF-Connolly-1856" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 1856</LINK>) and introducing social forms of treatment based on human respect. By the end of the nineteenth century, this policy was reversed in favour of restrictive custodial approaches due to staff shortage, over-crowding and concern about safety. In the 1930's the pendulum swung again with the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and insulin coma therapy. Optimism in the effectiveness of new treatments paralleled a move to more liberal care policies. Social attitudes continued to change after World War II, particularly with the introduction of anti-psychotic medication in 1952 (chlorpromazine and later drugs) making rehabilitation feasible even for those with serious mental illnesses. At the same time, the large asylums were criticised for being 'total institutions' (<LINK REF="REF-Goffman-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffman 1961</LINK>), inhumane and repressive (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1970</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1960s, in North America and Europe, large hospitals have been closed and small local general hospital units established. This has been a gradual process apart from in Italy where public mental hospitals were rapidly closed and admissions to asylums prohibited (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1985</LINK>). At the same time, many types of approaches to community care have evolved. For example, case management, a widely used community care regimen, which is now a statutory obligation in several countries. Current mental health policies and guidance in the UK encourage short hospital stay with follow-up by community programmes such as case management and the Care Programme Approach (CPA) (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1999</LINK>). Community care, however, has come under criticism for its failure to provide adequate care (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1994</LINK>), particularly for mentally ill 'revolving door patients' (people who have repeated, frequent admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>), and 'new long stay patients' (such as people with both mental illness and behaviour problems (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1976</LINK>)).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-07 05:42:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In many 'Western' countries, whilst bed numbers have declined, admission rates have risen (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1996</LINK>), perhaps as a direct result of community care policy (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1999</LINK>). Frequent short admissions are a common pattern of hospital care for people with serious mental illness. Other countries have had quite different experiences. One of the performance indicators in the National Service Framework for Mental Health in the UK is the reduction in the psychiatric emergency readmission rate (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-07 05:42:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Japan has increased bed provision in the last 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hafner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hafner 1987</LINK>) and many 'developing' countries provide either non-specialist 'standard' medical care or continue to use institutions unchanged for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Appleby-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 1991</LINK>). Most countries, however, are under pressure to change their bed provision and the effect of hospitalisation remains important to all. A degree of hospital care is likely to remain an integral part of any mental health service. Community care policies may change the pattern of hospital care for people with severe mental illness, favouring shorter admissions. It is therefore important to determine the effects of different lengths of hospital stay. This will help inform policy-makers in developing safe, appropriate, efficient and effective mental health services in the future.</P>

<OL>
<LI>those given a short stay in hospital defined as less than 28 days (an arbitrary compulsory length of stay as defined by the Mental Health Act 1983 of England and Wales) have differential response to those in hospital greater than 28 days; and that:</LI>
<LI>those over 65 years old have a differential response to length of hospital stay than younger people;</LI>
<LI>findings from trials conducted in the presence of community care programmes (however defined) have a differential response to studies conducted in the absence of community care programmes.</LI>

<P>For this update, BO and VG extracted data from included studies. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible. When further information was necessary, we contacted authors of studies in order to obtain missing data or for clarification. If studies were multi-centre, where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre separately.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>Had we encountered any continuous data, we would have included such data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>For future updates of this review where continuous data may be identified; ideally the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. Had we encountered such data, we would have combined endpoint and change data in the analysis and used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we would have applied the following standards to all data before inclusion:<BR/>a) standard deviations (SDs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;<BR/>b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>));<BR/>c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score.<BR/>
<BR/>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We would have entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants as other data within the data and analysis section tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we would have entered skewed endpoint data from large trials into syntheses. We found skewed data in three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK>), which were presented in 'other data' tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). This method will be useful in future updates of this review, where continuous data may be identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for planned short-stay/brief admission. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not improved'), we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results, we used 'Summary of findings' tables to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTB) /to induce harm (NNTH) statistic and its 95% CI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any useable non-skew continuous data in this review; had we identified such data, we had planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity had been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-01-15 10:05:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For future updates of this review where cluster-randomised studies are identified and where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique. Again, no such data were identified for this current version of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, had we identified such trials, we would only have used data of the first phase of cross-over studies; this will be the case for future updated versions of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary we simply added these and combined within the two-by-two table. If data had been continuous, we would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias; this was the case with <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1979_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1979*</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - was used for those who did not. We had planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who complete the study to that point were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions; however, no study reported outcome data for our primary outcome of clinically important change in global state.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals (CIs) available for group means, and either a P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we would calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Burhan-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Burhan 1969</LINK> was the largest study with 1169 participants randomised and <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1976</LINK> was the smallest study with 74 participants. The other studies ranged in size between 141 and 247 participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In three studies, short stay varied from one week (<LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>) to 21 to 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1976</LINK>). Those allocated to short stay received other treatments such as discharge planning and crisis resolution training (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1976</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK> reported allocating participants to either short stay or control without defining the length of short stay. No specific 'community-based' interventions were reported except for <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1979_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1979*</LINK> (day care). The effects of the presence or absence of these programmes are discussed.</P>
<P>Two trials clearly reported the minimum and maximum duration of long stay before the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1976</LINK>). Otherwise, professional carers determined the length of stay. Two trials specified a cut-off for long stays (at 45 days, <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1979_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1979*</LINK>; 60 days, <LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>). No specific intervention was reported for those allocated to the long-stay group after discharge. Antipsychotic drugs were the main treatment for participants and most trials reported similar use in both long- and short-stay participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Data relating to readmissions (not relapse), loss to follow-up, premature discharge, delayed discharge, and employment were possible to extract. Deaths (suicides and all-causes) were noted in three trials but attributed to experimental or control groups in only one (<LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>). Parasuicide episodes and readmission to hospital due to parasuicide were reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK>). No data were reported on relapse, criminal behaviour or imprisonment. Trialists used many different scales but all were reported without any reference to standard deviations, and therefore could not be summated.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Death</HEADING>
<P>Deaths were very poorly recorded with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>. Further information on death rates was sought from trialists, but we were unable to obtain additional information. No trial mentioned violence, criminal offence or imprisonment as an outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>All continuous data on mental outcomes could not be synthesised as standard deviations were not reported. One small trial, <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>, did record relevant, but equivocal data. This came from a subset (n = 61) of the full study (n = 141). Data reported in their final report of the study could not be extracted. It is, therefore, inadvisable to draw firm conclusions from so little data but currently there is no evidence that shorter lengths of stay are harmful to a person's mental state.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Service outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3.1 Readmissions to hospital</HEADING>
<P>There were no significant differences for readmission rates between the short- and long-stay groups at one and two years with the homogeneous studies (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>). There is no evidence to support the theory that short-stay policies, in themselves, promote a 'revolving door' pattern of admissions for those with serious mental illnesses. The unusual <LINK REF="STD-Burhan-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Burhan 1969</LINK> study showed how a remarkable degree of support for those allocated to a short-stay policy may well substantially decrease the numbers readmitted. It is thought that this support, involving the author providing sole aftercare including daily visits, counselling and 24 hours personal access via a telephone was the reason for the introduction of heterogeneity. Lessons should be drawn for practice and research from this unusual trial, providing remarkable planning and supervision for short-stay admissions. The other studies did not offer this degree of support. Only <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK> reported data for the outcome of readmission because of a parasuicidal act and being allocated to an initial short stay did not increase the likelihood of being admitted to hospital for a suicide attempt. Again, this is reassuring.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3.2 Delayed discharge/Leaving hospital prematurely</HEADING>
<P>Hospitals were significantly more successful in achieving discharge on time for those allocated to short stay. However, those in the short-stay policy groups were no more likely to have a premature/abrupt discharge than the long-stay group. The theories of institutionalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Goffman-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffman 1961</LINK>) could explain successful discharge of short-stay patients, suggesting that longer hospitalisation leads to difficulties for patients to re-enter the real world. Planning discharge and aftercare planning may also be more likely in the short-stay group; the impetus to institute these processes might not be present when there are no restrictions to the length of the admission. Also, from the consumer perspective, knowing that the admission will be short may improve engagement in discharge planning.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3.3 Day care</HEADING>
<P>We found those people in the short-stay group were prescribed significantly more day care in the <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK> study, although no data were available from this study for readmission rates. It is not clear from other studies that this is a common outcome of a short-stay policy. This may partly explain the findings in <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK> where the post-discharge cost of the short stay policy is really no different, and may be more, than the standard approach to hospitalisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported parasuicide episodes in the medium term (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK>) and it showed no demonstrable difference between the groups. No study reported violent incidents to others or to property.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.5 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>The results suggest that, over two years, short-stay patients are not significantly at greater risk to being lost to follow-up than those allocated to long stays.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.6 General functioning</HEADING>
<P>Available studies did not specifically highlight participants' social functioning although general functioning was addressed in the context of employment and work attendance.</P>
<P>Although data do suggest higher rates of employment/independent living for those allocated to short-stay policies, these should be interpreted with caution. The trial that provided greater aftercare for the short-stay group (<LINK REF="STD-Herz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Herz 1975</LINK>) showed greatest effect on employment status. This important finding should be replicated.</P>
<P>Only one study provided data on work attendance and no difference was shown between groups both in the short and medium terms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.6 Economic outcomes: Costs of care</HEADING>
<P>Economic data were very poor and difficult to interpret. No study reported indirect costs (that is travel, family costs, etc.) and intangible costs (such as inconvenience). Once a person is discharged, <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1975</LINK> suggests that there is really not much difference between the two groups, and if anything the short-stay group cost more once they had left hospital. This could, perhaps be explained if it was common to use more day hospital for these people compared with those whose hospital stay was longer as was seen in <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK>. However, should the mean length of stay be used as a measure of resources consumed, the long stay average costs would be much more than the short stay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Adding <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1980</LINK> introduced moderate heterogeneity to the outcome of readmission rate at one year. Including this study increased the relative risk of being readmitted to hospital if in the short-stay group at one year to 1.26 (95% CI 1.0 to 11.6). This study is considerably different from the other included studies in its type of participants. It randomised all acute, unselected psychiatric admissions including people with organic brain disorders and alcohol problems.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>All trials failed to report continuous data in a way that was useful to the review authors. These included outcomes for mental state, social functioning and family burden. Fourteen different scales, some of unknown validity were used. No trial reported user satisfaction, perhaps because the measurement of the consumers' views were not considered important in the 1960s and 1970s. Questions regarding the effect of a short-stay policy on these important variables remain unanswered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The review utilised data from six trials reported from 1969 to 1980. Four trials came from the US and two from the UK. It is difficult to know whether the results would be equally applicable to the psychiatry of the low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the American definition of schizophrenia has been shown to be broader than other countries during this period (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1972</LINK>) and psychiatric services differ between the US and the UK. This may have yet further implications for generalisability of the results of this review. However, the fact that the findings of trials within these two very different care cultures are not substantially different suggests that the results of this review can, at least, be considered for those who work within diverse settings.</P>
<P>The fact that all these trials were mainly published in the 1970s may be the result of a window of opportunity to conduct studies of this sort before the large institutions closed in these countries. These trials, therefore, offer unique information about health policy that would be difficult to repeat today in high-income countries where large institutions have closed. If questions remain unanswered as regards the effect of a short-stay versus a longer-stay policy, it may be for countries other than the US and the UK to help supply the answers.</P>
<P>None of the included trials had participants aged 65 years and over, therefore, we were unable to test the hypothesis that this age group may have a differential response to younger age groups in this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the six included studies, all are pre-<A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org">CONSORT</A> (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and the methodological quality of these studies was judged to be poor; rated either <I>low</I> or <I>very low quality</I>.To a large extent, these studies have not mentioned that they followed a specific method of randomisation and much of the data was unusable. Poor methodological standards have been associated with an overestimate of treatment effect, which should be kept in mind when viewing the results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-14 13:48:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2012 update search, review authors OB and VG independently screened results for eligible inclusion in the review, this was cross-checked by SS. No new studies were included, and therefore there is little chance that any biases arose in this updating process. There may remain potential publication bias, where we may have overlooked unpublished studies. Every effort was made, however, to extensively search references from our search results, in order to identify any other completed or ongoing studies. 'Summary of findings' outcomes were selected by BO and VG; their decision to use the selected outcomes was not influenced by the data already present in the previously published review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with serious mental illness and their carers</HEADING>
<P>Data from this review can partially reassure those coming into a hospital that has a short-stay policy (of less than 28 days) that they are no more likely to be readmitted, to leave hospital abruptly, or to lose contact with services after leaving hospital than had they received long stay care. They are also more likely to leave hospital on their planned discharge date and possibly have a greater chance of finding employment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>For clinicians concerned about the uncertainty and safety of a short-stay policy, there is some reassurance that it does not promote a 'revolving door' pattern of admissions and possible fragmentation of care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policy makers and commissioners of care</HEADING>
<P>Length-of-stay policies have a direct relationship to the size and provision of in-patient facilities. These, in turn, have a major impact on how resources are used. Traditionally, planners assess levels of in-patient provision based on national and international comparisons, rather than on the effectiveness of short- versus long-stay policies. This review attempts to address this and, based on limited data so far, commissioning short-stay policies appears to be an appropriate use of resource. It also indirectly supports the commissioning of services where discharge and aftercare planning is a priority.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>The studies we identified were pioneering and important. If their findings had been more clearly reported, as is now recommended by the <A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org">CONSORT</A> statements (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>;, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), this review would have had more findings to report. Continuous data should be presented with standard deviations. With <A HREF="http://alltrials.net">ALLTRIALS</A> perhaps, some day, more data will become available even from the old studies included in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>Further trials are needed in order to fill important gaps in knowledge, strengthen existing evidence, and allow greater generalisability to other care cultures. Trials should be large, simple, and clearly reported. These trials should address questions regarding the processes of discharge and aftercare planning. Criteria for entry could be broad, not focusing on 'perfectly' defined single disease categories, but well described, so that readers could extrapolate results for their own circumstances. This also applies to the interventions. These too can be pragmatic but well described. Simple outcomes should also be reported. For example, death, self-harm, harm to others, criminal behaviour, employment, and homelessness are not difficult to record. Mental, social and family outcomes, user satisfaction, and costs may be more problematic, but can often be recorded clearly in order to inform a wide readership (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

Patients could be excluded from randomisation in the interests of continuity of care, and about 1 in 4 were so managed" (page 205-206). Comment: probably done; however randomisation process was not explicitly defined. Allocation was randomised at the start however this was then breached for 25% of readmitted patients to ensure the continuity of care.</P>

<P>Allocation: the randomisation process should be clearly described.<BR/>Double-blind evaluation of the outcomes of a lifestyle intervention is extremely difficult, and probably impossible. Trialists should, take every precaution to minimise the effect of biases by using blinded or independent raters.<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis is preferable. Trialists should describe from which groups withdrawals came, why they occurred and what was their outcome.<BR/>Duration: Two-year follow-up at minimum.<BR/>Setting: in a situation where hospitalisation of people from schizophrenia tends to extend well beyond 28 days - perhaps in a low-middle-income country setting.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>1. Category: Discussion<BR/>The authors state that brief admissions to a psychiatric hospital "do not encourage a 'revolving door' pattern of care for people with serious mental illness and may be more effective than standard care." Such a conclusion would be erroneous and, in an era of aggressive cost containment, dangerous. This review merely presents a meta-analysis of four old and very different studies, each comparing 'long' with 'short' hospital stays. All the studies were performed more than 20 years ago, before the adoption of current diagnostic criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, and International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision) and modern treatment methods, such as use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic drugs. Further, the prominent decrease in psychiatric facilities (notably the American state hospital system) has meant that many of the patients with chronic mental illness who were institutionalised two decades ago are now subject to repeated acute care admissions to general hospitals. In the two included studies by Glick et al, a short admission was defined as 21-28 days and a long admission as 90-120 days. Clearly, the adjectives short and long have since come to have very different meanings: a four-week hospital stay today would generally be considered to be long. The other two studies were of a mixed sample of patients with either exclusively schizophrenic or 'functional psychiatric' disorders that conceivably could encompass all personality, mood and psychotic conditions. Can one draw an informed conclusion from pooling such outdated and heterogeneous data? At best this meta-analysis presents a historical snapshot of distant relevance to today's world of inpatient psychiatry. Nevertheless, profit-driven managed care companies may interpret this paper as justifying a solution to mental health cost control through the imposition of inappropriate limits on inpatient care.</P>

<P>1. Category: Discussion<BR/>The commentator is right that only old trials that met inclusion criteria for our systematic review on short versus long stays were identified, but he is wrong when he says that our findings are of distant relevance to today's psychiatry. We started the review with an important question. Over the past 40 years the lengths of patients' stays in hospital have been reduced so that mental institutions can be closed and to contain costs in many countries. As a result, there is serious public concern about the alternative community care after many deaths and repeated acute care admissions of seriously mentally ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DoH-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1994</LINK>). Some governments are now suggesting increasing hospital-based care as part of their modernisation programmes (DOH 1999). With all these policy changes, we simply asked: which is more effective from the patient's point of view, longer or shorter stays? The question is important to today's mental health service, and so the low level of research is both a disappointment and a challenge. We also share the concern that policy is driven by little research evidence, whether made by managed care companies in the United States or by the NHS in the United Kingdom (Knapp 1990). Yet most resources are spent on wards, staff, and buildings. There have been important advances in the treatment of serious mental illnesses, so why is there no recent robust and pragmatic research on how hospital care is organised and delivered?</P>

<P>1 Update search<BR/>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[((short* or brief* or length*) in same field as (admission* or hospital*) in REFERENCE and (*hospitali*) in STUDY]</P>
<P>This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, hand searches and conference proceedings (see Group Module).</P>
<P>1.2 Previous electronic searches</P>
<P>1.2.1 We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (June 2005) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[((short* or brief* or length*) in same field as (admission* or hospital*) in REFERENCE and (*hospitali*) in STUDY]</P>
<P>1.2.2 We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 1998) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[and ((short or brief) near (admission* or hospitali$ation*) or #42 = 114 or 327)]</P>
<P>#42 is the 'intervention' field of this register and '114 or 327' is the code for length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>1.2.3 We searched Biological Abstracts (January 1982 to May 1995) using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's phrase for both randomised controlled trials and schizophrenia combined with the phrase:</P>
<P>[and ((short or brief) near (admission* or hospitali$ation*))]</P>
<P>1.2.4 We searched EMBASE (January 1980 to May 1998) using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's phrase for both randomised controlled trials and schizophrenia combined with the phrase:</P>
<P>[and ((short or brief) near (admission* or hospitali$ation*))]</P>
<P>1.2.5 We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 1998) using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's phrase for both randomised controlled trials and schizophrenia combined with the phrase:</P>
<P>[and ((short or brief) near (admission* or hospitali$ation*))]</P>
<P>1.2.6 We searched PsycLIT (January 1974 to May 1995) using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's phrase for both randomised controlled trials and schizophrenia combined with the phrase:</P>
<P>[and ((short or brief) near (admission* or hospitali$ation*))]</P>
<P>1. Reference searching<BR/>We inspected the references of all identified studies for more studies.</P>
<P>2. SCISEARCH<BR/>We sought each of the included studies as a citation on the SCISEARCH (May 1998) database. Reports of articles that had cited these studies were inspected in order to identify further trials.</P>
<P>3. Personal contact<BR/>We sought the results from unpublished trials from authors of key studies. We contacted authors of published studies to request original data if appropriate or to seek clarifications.</P>

<P>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary]</P>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>PJ and GZ undertook the original search for trials, and independently inspected all reports. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion, and where doubt remained, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we independently decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, again we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment. For the updated version of the review, material downloaded from electronic resources included details of author, institution or journal of publication. NA inspected and selected all reports which were then reinspected by PJ to ensure reliable selection. We obtained full articles of the selected abstracts and independently decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Quality assessment<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>), which is based on the degree of allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Category A includes studies in which allocation has been randomised and concealment is explicit. Category B studies are those which have randomised allocation but in which concealment is not explicit. Category C studies are those in which allocation has neither been randomised nor concealed. We only included trials that were stated to be randomised (categories A or B of the handbook) in this review. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>3. Data extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data management<BR/>4.1 Loss to follow up (intention-to-treat /ITT analysis)<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we assumed people leaving early had a negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented them separately.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the fixed effects model. Relative Risk is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant and homogeneous we calculated the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H).</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Normal distribution<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); In cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we entered change data in RevMan analyses and reported the finding in the text to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented final endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Where studies reported only change data we contacted authors for endpoint figures.</P>
<P>4.3.3 Data synthesis<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups based on a fixed effects model.</P>
<P>4.4 Scale derived data<BR/>A wide range of scales/instruments are available to measure outcomes in psychiatric care. These instruments vary greatly in quality. Instruments should be reliable (have a known degree of stability when a measurement is repeated under identical conditions) and valid (really measure what it actually purports to measure (<LINK REF="REF-Rust-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 1989</LINK>). In this review we only used outcomes measured by instruments which have been published in peer reviewed journals. In addition, data from rating scales were only used if it was (i) self-reported or completed by an independent rater or relative; and (ii) more than 50% complete.</P>
<P>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, this was interpreted as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity, and when it was between 50-75% it was interpreted as indicating moderate levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency were thought to be high, data were not summated and presented as part of the main results, but were presented separately and a sensitivity analysis performed. Reasons for heterogeneity were investigated whenever possible.</P>
<P>6. Sensitivity analysis<BR/>We excluded data from quasi-randomised trials and from trials including unselected psychiatric admissions from the main analysis and these were entered into a sensitivity analysis to see if these exclusions were justified.</P>
<P>7. General issues<BR/>Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a 'favourable' outcome for the treatment group. Where this was not possible, we labelled the graphs in RevMan analyses accordingly so that the direction of any effects was clear.</P>

<P>Over the last hundred years medical opinion as to whether people with a severe mental illness should stay in hospital for months and years versus a few weeks has changed. This has been helped by the advent of medication for some of these illnesses. Consequently, in the developed world hospital stays are now relatively short. However even in these countries there is still some doubt as to whether really short admissions are helpful because the person does not get institutionalised, or harmful because the symptoms and possible causes of the illness are not completely addressed. There are a group of patients who have short but frequent admissions (&#8216;revolving door patients&#8217;) and others who despite a variety of treatments stay in hospital for a long time (&#8216;new long stay patients&#8217;).</P>
<P>To identify what length of stay in hospital is most helpful; this review looks at trials comparing short hospital stays ranged from one week to 21-28 days with long hospital stays, which was only clearly reported in two studies (90 to 120 days), otherwise professional carers determined length of stay. Six studies were found containing a total of 2030 people, four in the USA and two in the UK. However, differences in the design of the trials made them difficult to compare. In addition all of the trials were done before 1980 when there was less choice of medication and greater differences in the diagnoses between the US and the UK. One study showed a statistically significant drop in the number of people readmitted to hospital in the short stay group, but these people had almost daily input from a clinician. The remaining studies showed no significant difference between the two groups. In two trials, the short-stay group were more likely to be employed after two years. In three trials the long-stay group were more likely to stay in hospital after the date they were supposed to be discharged. Although the data from these trials is not extensive there is a suggestion that short stays in hospital in themselves do not cause people to become &#8216;revolving door patients&#8217;. A new trial that is large, simple and clearly recorded, would help to confirm these results.</P>
