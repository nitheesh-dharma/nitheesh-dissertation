<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 16:50:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Vitamin K given to women before a very preterm birth does not decrease the risk of bleeding in the brain and associated neurological injury in babies born very preterm.</P>
<P>Babies born very early (before 34 weeks) are at risk of bleeding in the brain (periventricular haemorrhage). This can be a cause of brain damage that might lead to neurological disabilities including cerebral palsy. Preterm infants have reduced levels of clotting factors, some of which require vitamin K for activation. Vitamin K may therefore help the blood to clot in preterm babies and so decrease this risk of haemorrhage. The review of trials did not find vitamin K, given as an injection to women immediately prior to a very preterm birth, decreased the risk of periventricular haemorrhage in their babies. There were too few data on children at follow up to assess the effects of vitamin K given immediately before very preterm birth on child development. Eight trials were included but only seven contributed data to the results. These seven trials involved 843 women. The trials were of variable quality and only two trials used a placebo.</P>
<P>In four trials that did not use placebo, more women were treated with vitamin K also received corticosteroids before giving birth compared to those not receiving vitamin K. Prenatal corticosteroids are known to reduce the rate of haemorrhage. Women receiving vitamin K were also more likely to be treated with phenobarbital in one trial.</P>
<P>Women given vitamin K reported a rash in two trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:52:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Preterm infants are at risk of periventricular haemorrhage (PVH). This can be a sign of brain damage that might lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including cerebral palsy. It has been suggested that vitamin K might improve coagulation in preterm infants and thereby decrease the risk of PVH.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:52:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of vitamin K administered parenterally or orally to women at risk of imminent preterm birth. The primary outcomes were neonatal mortality, neonatal neurological morbidity, as measured by the presence of PVH on ultrasound during the first week of life, and long-term neurodevelopment. Secondary outcomes included other neonatal morbidity and any maternal side effects.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 16:47:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Eight trials were included but only seven (843 women) contributed data to the results. The trials were of variable quality. Antenatal vitamin K was associated with a non-significant reduction in all grades of PVH (risk ratio (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.06) and a significant reduction in severe PVH (grades 3 and 4) (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91) for babies receiving prenatal vitamin K compared with control babies. When the two quasi-randomised trials were excluded, antenatal vitamin K was associated with a non-significant reduction in all grades of PVH (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.26) and a non-significant reduction in severe PVH (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.36).</P>
<P>Treatment with vitamin K resulted in a significant reduction in the Bayley Mental Development Index at two years of age (mean difference (MD) -9.00; 95% CI -16.66 to -1.34, one trial, 121 children); however, these results are derived from one trial with many participants lost to follow up. No difference was found in the incidence of other neurodevelopmental abnormalities at paediatric follow up at 18 to 24 months or seven years of age between children born to mothers given vitamin K and children not so exposed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-10 12:03:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-10 12:03:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Preterm infants born before 34 weeks' gestation, and especially if born before 30 weeks, are at significant risk of developing brain injury in association with periventricular haemorrhage (PVH). Such lesions are associated with later neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>The cause of haemorrhage is uncertain, although it has been hypothesised that brain ischaemia followed by bleeding, usually arising in the subependymal germinal matrix, is the most likely explanation. Fluctuations in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion around birth and during early postnatal adaptation might also be involved. Coagulation disorders have been described in infants with PVH. Preterm infants in general have reduced levels of clotting factors, some of which require vitamin K for activation.</P>
<P>Most PVHs are manifest on head ultrasound within 72 hours of birth although the severity may change after this time (<LINK REF="REF-Vohr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haemorrhages are usually graded for severity:<BR/>grade 1 - confined to the germinal matrix;<BR/>grade 2 - in the lateral ventricle;<BR/>grade 3 - distending the ventricle;<BR/>grade 4 - intracerebral.</P>
<P>The latter two grades are strongly associated with long-term neurological sequelae.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-20 02:28:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin K given intramuscularly, intravenously or orally in the antenatal period.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:53:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>It has been postulated that vitamin K might improve the coagulation status of preterm infants and reduce the frequency of PVH. As many haemorrhages are thought to originate close to the time of birth, prophylactic antenatal rather than postnatal treatment may be preferable. Maternally administered vitamin K only crosses the placenta in small amounts with a maternal-fetal gradient of 30:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Shearer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shearer 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>For further background and discussion regarding prevention and treatment of PVH, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1992</LINK>.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-10 12:03:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>PVH has severe effects on the infant's brain and subsequent development. There is a need to identify the most safe and efficacious method to prevent PVH in preterm infants to improve mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 12:21:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The benefit of vitamin K in preventing severe periventricular haemorrhage (PVH) and the trend to an apparent benefit of prenatal vitamin K in preventing all grades of PVH, shown in the overall analysis, is unlikely to be a true effect of the drug. This is suggested by the change in treatment effect when only higher quality trials are considered. There was an imbalance in the use of prenatal corticosteroids, which is known to reduce rates of PVH, in all four trials that were not placebo blinded. The effect of prenatal vitamin K on long-term neurodevelopment is uncertain. No differences were seen in the one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>) that reported follow up after hospital discharge of the children, although the rates of exclusion were high (71% at two years and 28% at seven years).</P>
<P>The apparent lack of effect of vitamin K could be explained by poor placental transfer of vitamin K and, therefore, poor effect on fetal coagulation factors.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 12:22:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>No data are available at present on the effects of vitamin K when given to women prior to preterm birth at different gestations. It is not recommended that vitamin K be used in routine practice due to the poor quality of the current evidence and the questionable efficacy of vitamin K in preventing PVH in the high-quality trial. Also, only four of the eight included trials reported on maternal side effects. This must be assessed more completely before vitamin K is accepted into routine practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:59:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is a paucity of high-quality evidence in assessing the efficacy of vitamin K to reduce PVH in preterm infants. Only one trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>) had adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment and less than 20% post-randomisation exclusions.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-05 11:49:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>), which was also the best quality trial, had phenobarbital as a co-treatment with vitamin K. Evidence from the systematic review of trials evaluating prenatal phenobarbital prior to preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2010a</LINK>) suggests that phenobarbital does not influence the rate of PVH.</P>

<P>Further trials cannot be considered a priority. However, if future trials are planned, they should be of high quality and should examine the effects of vitamin K administration at gestational ages with a high risk of periventricular haemorrhage, stratify for gestational age and ensure minimal exclusions after randomisation. Neurodevelopmental status at follow up should be measured as the most important outcome.</P>
