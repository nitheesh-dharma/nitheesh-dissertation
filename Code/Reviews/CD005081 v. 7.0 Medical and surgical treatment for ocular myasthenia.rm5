<TITLE>Medical and surgical treatment for ocular myasthenia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:24:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Ocular myasthenia is a form of myasthenia gravis in which weakened eye muscles cause double vision or drooping eyelids. It accounts for approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own antibodies block the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, causing fluctuating weakness and muscles that tire easily. Approximately half of people who have ocular myasthenia will go on to develop generalised myasthenia gravis and weakness affecting other muscles. For the majority of people this will be within the first two years of developing ocular symptoms.</P>
<P>The aims of treatment for ocular myasthenia are to return the person to a state of clear vision and to prevent the development, or limit the severity of generalised myasthenia gravis. Treatments proposed for ocular myasthenia include drugs that suppress the immune system including corticosteroids and azathioprine, thymectomy (surgical removal of the thymus gland), and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (which increases acetylcholine to compensate for the lack of acetylcholine receptors).</P>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia were identified in the original version of this review in 2006 and no new trials in this or previous updates. One trial included 43 ocular myasthenia participants treated with corticotropin (a type of corticosteroid) or placebo. The other only included three participants with ocular myasthenia and seven with generalised myasthenia gravis who were treated with intranasal neostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) or placebo. Neither trial enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding how effective these treatments were in preventing progression to the development of generalised myasthenia gravis or in improving ocular symptoms. Several reasonably good quality non-randomised studies favor the use of corticosteroids and azathioprine but these and other agents need to be tested in well-designed RCTs.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of treatments for ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any treatments that impact the progression from ocular to generalized disease?

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:24:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (3 August 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1996 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full texts of possibly relevant articles were reviewed. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, we contacted authors for further information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-13 15:44:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inclusion required meeting three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:24:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In the original review, we identified two RCTs relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. There were no new RCTs in searches conducted for this or previous updates. In the absence of data from RCTs, we present a review of the available observational data.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-13 15:44:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:27:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-30 10:48:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a term derived from the Greek 'myasthenia' meaning 'muscle weakness' and the Latin 'gravis' meaning 'serious'. The disease is characterized by weakness, which causes fatigue, and a distinct propensity for involvement of the ocular muscles that leads to the complaints of drooping eyelids or double vision (<LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>). Based on retrospective case reviews, ocular manifestations are the first sign of MG in about 50% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bever-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bever 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>). Between 50% to 60% of those who initially present with ocular symptoms will progress to develop generalized muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Bever-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bever 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>) and the vast majority will do so within the first one to two years (<LINK REF="REF-Bever-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bever 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>). Myasthenia gravis is the result of an autoimmune attack against the neuromuscular junction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaminski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaminski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2001</LINK>). The primary antigenic target in most people is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) located on the post-synaptic surface of the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are detected in about 90% of people with generalized MG and about 50% of patients with disease restricted to the ocular muscles, so-called ocular myasthenia. Recently, a muscle specific kinase has been proposed as another antigenic target, but restricted ocular myasthenia appears not to occur in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of ocular manifestations may be considered to have two goals: (1) to return the person to a state of clear vision and (2) to prevent, or limit the severity of, the generalization of the disease. It has been suggested that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective in improving visual disability in 20% to 40% of people with ocular myasthenia (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>), but are not thought to have significant immunomodulatory effects that would influence generalization of the disease. Corticosteroids are frequently used in the treatment of ocular myasthenia to limit symptoms. Uncontrolled, retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>) suggest that treatment reduces the risk of progression to generalized disease. However, the adverse effects of such treatment have not been well characterized. For ocular myasthenia, thymectomy, a commonly applied treatment for generalized MG, has been used to a limited extent and in highly selected populations with visual disability considered to be unresponsive to other therapy. These studies report remission rates of 6% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumm-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>). Generalized MG is often treated with azathioprine, cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil. Only azathioprine has been retrospectively evaluated as a treatment for ocular myasthenia and suggested to be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been no prior systematic reviews of the treatments for ocular myasthenia. This updated review evaluates the evidence from therapeutic studies of treatments for ocular myasthenia.</P>

<P>The number of papers found by the new, current strategies are as follows: Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register 5 papers, CENTRAL 8 papers, MEDLINE 320 papers, EMBASE 40 papers.</P>
<P>We identified two RCTs that included participants with ocular myasthenia (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK>) in the original version of this review. The characteristics of these two studies are summarized in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Only one of these studies reported results in terms of the primary or secondary outcome measures that were planned for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK>). In the updates in 2008, 2010 and 2012 there were no new RCTs, although a preliminary report of the Mount study was identified and added to the references.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK> included 43 patients with ocular myasthenia who were randomized to receive either an eight-day course of corticotropin (ACTH) or placebo in a parallel-group design. The range of ocular movement was determined from projections of photographic negatives of each eye in different positions of gaze. By marking the mid-point of the pupil with the eye deviated to the left, to the right, upwards and downwards, and then connecting these four points with an elliptical curved line, the investigators estimated the area of eye movement. The effectiveness of therapy was determined by comparing the area of eye movement between baseline and post-treatment time points (at 10 days, one month and three months). Results were reported separately for each eye. There was no evaluation of ocular symptoms or the risk of progression to generalized disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK> included only three participants with ocular myasthenia (and seven patients with generalized MG) who were randomized to receive a two-week course of either intranasal neostigmine or placebo. The study had a cross-over design without a wash out period. No primary outcome measure was specified, but the authors reported that ptosis was improved in one of the participants during treatment with neostigmine.</P>

<P>The risk of bias items have been summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>In the first study identical vials containing ACTH or placebo were coded with a random number at a central office before being sent to each study site together with a list of random numbers that corresponded to the numbers on the medication vials. Patients entered into the study were assigned sequentially, based on the list of random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>). The second study contained no description of whether any attempt was made to conceal treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>The first study stated that the vials containing active and placebo medications were identical and that participants, nurses and attending physicians were unaware of the assigned treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>).

<P>In the first study investigators reported outcomes in terms of an objective measurement of eye movement (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>) as they originally proposed. The second study did not describe pre-specified outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:27:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>This systematic review of the literature identified two RCTs involving medical or surgical treatment of ocular myasthenia. There were no new trials in this update.</P>
<P>The results of the RCT of corticotropin versus placebo were reported in terms of the change in area of eye movements between pre- and post-treatment evaluations, with the results reported separately for each eye at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Mount-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Mount 1964</LINK>). The odds ratios (ORs) (and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for improvement in area of eye movements amongst those treated with corticotropin compared to those who received placebo were 2.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 12) for the right eye and 10.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 25.2) for the left eye. The methodological quality of this study was generally good with the exception of the relatively high rate of loss to follow-up with results reported for only 67% of right eyes and 77% of left eyes. The study results, however, were difficult to interpret because of the lack of any clinically meaningful measures of response to therapy.</P>
<P>The sample size of the second RCT was too small to permit any meaningful conclusions regarding the efficacy of intranasal neostigmine (<LINK REF="STD-Badrising-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Badrising 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been no RCTs of other forms of immunosuppression (for example azathioprine, cyclosporine), thymectomy or oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.</P>
<P>This review also identified 10 observational (case control or cohort) studies that included patients with ocular myasthenia (<LINK REF="REF-Bhanushali-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhanushali 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papapetropoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papapetropoulos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatestas-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatestas 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>). It was necessary to contact the authors of three of these studies for further information (<LINK REF="REF-Bhanushali-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhanushali 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evoli-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evoli 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>) but only two were able to provide the required data (<LINK REF="REF-Bhanushali-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhanushali 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rates of progression to generalized myasthenia amongst treated and untreated patients were reported in eight of these studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papapetropoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papapetropoulos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>). Corticosteroids were used as active therapy in seven of these studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papapetropoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papapetropoulos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>), azathioprine in two (<LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>) and thymectomy in one (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>). Four of the observational studies reported outcome in terms of improvement in ocular symptoms; prednisone was the active therapy in two (<LINK REF="REF-Bhanushali-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhanushali 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>) and thymectomy was the active therapy in the other two (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatestas-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatestas 1987</LINK>). The methodological quality and results of these studies are summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. The quality of these studies was fairly uniform with adequate control for confounding, reasonably complete follow-up and lack of observer blinding.</P>
<P>Among the two studies that examined the effects of oral corticosteroids on control of ocular symptoms, the point estimates of the OR favored steroids in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Bhanushali-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhanushali 2008</LINK>), but not the other (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>); the CIs around the OR in both of these studies, spanned unity.</P>
<P>The point estimates of the OR in five of the seven studies that examined the effects of oral corticosteroids showed a benefit in terms of reducing the risk of progression to generalized MG (<LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>). The CI of the OR in the remaining two studies spanned unity (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papapetropoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papapetropoulos 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies that examined the effects of azathioprine both showed a beneficial effect on the risk of progression to generalized MG with CIs that did not span unity (<LINK REF="REF-Mee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies that examined the effects of thymectomy showed no benefit in terms of improvement in ocular symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatestas-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatestas 1987</LINK>) or risk of progression to generalized MG (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-30 10:50:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The available evidence from RCTs does not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents or thymectomy in people with ocular myasthenia with respect to the outcome measures of improved ocular symptoms and the risk of progression to generalized MG. The data from several observational studies favor the use of corticosteroids and azathioprine but the uncontrolled nature of these reports limits the ability to draw any firm conclusions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-30 10:50:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is a need for well-designed randomized, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. These studies should employ clinically relevant outcome measures such as improvement or resolution of ocular symptoms and the risk of progression to generalized MG.</P>
<P>In the absence of RCTs, well-designed observational studies may shed light on the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. These studies should control adequately for potentially confounding factors (age, the use of concomitant therapy, the duration of ocular symptoms prior to entry into the study, the duration of follow-up following entry into the study, antibody status, and the presence of systemic abnormalities of repetitive nerve stimulation or single fiber electromyography); assess adverse effects, and should ensure that the outcome measure is ascertained in a blinded fashion in order to minimize bias.</P>

<P>Pyridostigmine for a period of 4 to 6 weeks, with dose escalated until efficacy or toxicity that could not be mitigated with a selective muscarinic antagonist; the maximum pyridostigmine dose permitted was 480 mg/day.</P>
<P>
<B>Stage 1</B>: Subjects whose symptoms failed to remit continued to take pyridostigmine and were randomized to either placebo or prednisone starting at 10 mg every other day, and titrated to a maximum of 40 mg/day over 16 weeks. Prednisone was started at a dose of 10 mg every other day; it was then initially increased to 10 mg/day, then 20 mg alternating with 10 mg, and so forth, with adjustments in dose made no more frequently than every 2 weeks. Dosage was titrated according to whether minimal manifestation status (MMS) had been attained and the presence and nature of adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Stage 2</B>: After the initial 16-week period, participants who had not achieved MMS were crossed over to treatment with high-dose prednisone (60 mg/day). The dose was tapered thereafter based on efficacy and safety/tolerability. Dosage was initially reduced to 50 mg/day, then 40 mg/day, and so forth down to 10 mg/day, with adjustments made every 2 weeks. After 2 weeks at 10 mg/day, the dose could be reduced to 10 mg every other day. For participants whose symptoms did remit during Stage 1, the study drug was tapered in a double-blind manner in stage 2.</P>
<P>This stage also lasted for 16 weeks.</P>
