<P>Anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelet drugs to prevent a second stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a heart rhythm disorder commonly found in patients who have had a stroke. Patients with NRAF have an irregular heart beat. This can cause the formation of a blood clot in the left atrium of the heart. This clot may break away and block a cerebral artery, thus causing a stroke. Patients who have had a stroke in the presence of NRAF have a high risk of another stroke. Anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, make the blood 'thinner' and prevent the formation of blood clots and hence could prevent stroke. However, anticoagulant drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain and this complication could offset any benefits. Aspirin may be a safer alternative. This review identified two trials in which patients with NRAF who had a stroke were treated with anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy. These studies show that anticoagulants are superior to antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke are at risk of recurrent stroke. Both warfarin and aspirin have been shown to reduce the recurrence of vascular events.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the effect of anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents, for secondary prevention, in people with NRAF and previous cerebral ischemia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched 9 June 2003) and contacted trialists.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents in patients with NRAF and a previous TIA or minor ischemic stroke.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both reviewers extracted and analysed data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trial were identified. The European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT) involving 455 patients, who received either anticoagulants (International Normalised Ratio (INR) 2.5 to 4.0), or aspirin (300 mg/day). Patients joined the trial within three months of transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. The mean follow up was 2.3 years. In the Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale (SIFA) trial, 916 patients with NRAF and a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 15 days were randomised to open label anticoagulants (INR 2.0 to 3.5) or indobufen (a reversible platelet cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 100 or 200 mg BID). The follow-up period was one year. The combined results show that anticoagulants were significantly more effective than antiplatelet therapy both for all vascular events (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.91) and for recurrent stroke (Peto OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.72). Major extracranial bleeding complications occurred more often in patients on anticoagulants (Peto OR 5.16, 95% CI 2.08 to 12.83), but the absolute difference was small (2.8% per year versus 0.9% per year in EAFT and 0.9% per year versus 0% in SIFA). Warfarin did not cause a significant increase of intracranial bleeds.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from two trials suggests that anticoagulant therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke in people with NRAF and recent non-disabling stroke or TIA. The risk of extracranial bleeding was higher with anticoagulant therapy than with antiplatelet therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-16 14:29:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a common dysrhythmia and it can be found in about 15% of all stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 1992</LINK>) and in about 2% to 17% of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) (<LINK REF="REF-Bogousslavsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogousslavsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koudstaal-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koudstaal 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whisnant-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whisnant 1999</LINK>). NRAF more than quadruples the risk of stroke as compared to patients in sinus rhythm (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1991</LINK>). Following an initial stroke, the stroke recurrence rate varies in different studies between 2% and 15% in the first year following stroke, and is 5% yearly thereafter, with a mortality rate of 5% yearly (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Around 1990, five clinical trials investigated the value of anticoagulation in the primary prevention of stroke and other vascular events in patients with NRAF (in a referral setting) (<LINK REF="REF-AFASAK-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFASAK 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BAATAF-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAATAF 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAFA-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAFA 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SPAF-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>). A meta-analysis of these trials showed that warfarin consistently decreased the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (a 68% reduction in risk) with virtually no increase in the frequency of major bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>). Aspirin is also effective for (primary and secondary) stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, but the effect is modest (about 20%) (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK>). However, in the PATAF study, in which primary care patients with atrial fibrillation were studied, neither low nor standard intensity warfarin proved to be better than aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-PATAF-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">PATAF 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recently published individual patient meta-analysis from six published randomised clinical trials comparing warfarin to aspirin showed the superiority of warfarin over aspirin. However, only 25% of these patients had a history of stroke, and trials with antiplatelet agents other than aspirin were not considered (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Walraven 2002</LINK>). For neurologists, secondary prevention of stroke is of greater relevance to their everyday clinical practice than primary prevention. In the absence of direct data supporting the value of anticoagulants or antiplatelets in secondary prevention, many physicians probably extrapolate the results of the primary prevention trials. However, this is not without risk. Firstly, NRAF patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke are likely to have more advanced atherosclerosis of extra- and intracranial blood vessels. Together with a fresh ischemic lesion and higher mean age this may lead to a much higher risk of intracerebral bleeding. Secondly, in at least a third of NRAF patients with recent cerebral ischemia, the stroke is related to an arterial lesion rather than to embolism from the heart (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>) and antiplatelets may be the most effective drug in such patients.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy versus control and anticoagulant therapy versus control for secondary prevention in patients with NRAF has been discussed in two other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Koudstaal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koudstaal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2004</LINK>). The object of this review is to compare the effectiveness of anticoagulant versus antiplatelet therapy for these patients.</P>

<P>The trials that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by both reviewers. Since one of the reviewers (PJK) was also the principal investigator of one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>), information about the method of randomisation, blinding, type of analysis, and outcome measures was easily obtained. Peto odds ratios were used to combine the results of the two trials. We tested for heterogeneity between trials using Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>statistics with its degrees of freedom (df) and its P-value, and the statistic I<SUP>2</SUP>, measuring the extent of inconsistency among results. Because the treatment effect of aspirin did not differ between group 1 and 2 (see 'Description of studies'), the results in the two groups were combined in the original EAFT paper. In this review we used the raw (unpublished) data from the EAFT for the antiplatelet group that is used in this review.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>In the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>), 1007 NRAF patients with a TIA or minor stroke within the preceding three months were randomised. They were divided into two groups, those without (group 1) or with (group 2) contraindications to anticoagulants. Patients in group 1 (n = 669) were randomised to treatment with open-label anticoagulants (n = 225; target International Normalised Ratio (INR) range: 2.5 to 4.0) or double-blind treatment with 300 mg aspirin (n = 230) or matching placebo (n = 214). Group 2 patients (n = 338) were randomised to double-blind treatment with aspirin or placebo. Forty-three percent were randomised within two weeks of stroke onset. For the purpose of this review, only the patients in group 1 were considered, and those in group 1 randomised to placebo were excluded, thus leaving 455 patients. The primary measure of outcome was the composite event of vascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction or systematic embolism, whichever occurred first. The secondary outcome was death from all causes, and all strokes (fatal or nonfatal) and all major thromboembolic events. The mean duration of follow up was of 2.3 years, and follow-up visits were planned four-monthly (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In the Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale (<LINK REF="STD-SIFA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SIFA 1997</LINK>) 916 patients with NRAF and a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 15 days were randomised to open label anticoagulants (INR 2.0 to 3.5) or indobufen (100 or 200 mg BID). Indobufen is a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Cattaneo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattaneo 1990</LINK>), which has been shown to be effective as an antithrombotic agent in the prevention of graft occlusion after coronary bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rajah-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajah 1994</LINK>) as well as in the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with heart disease<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Fornaro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fornaro 1993</LINK>). Indobufen was administered orally at the recommended dose of 200 mg BID, which was lowered to 100 mg BID in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 80 mL/min). In the indobufen group, 75% received 200 mg BID and 25% 100 mg BID. The primary outcome was the combined incidence of non-fatal stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), pulmonary or systemic embolism, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death. Non-vascular death or all deaths was not an outcome measure. Follow up was one year, and follow-up visits were three-monthly (<LINK REF="STD-SIFA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SIFA 1997</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-16 14:32:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Both trials were multicenter, randomised, controlled studies which compared open label anticoagulant therapy with an antiplatelet agent. The EAFT trial also had a placebo group who received tablets matching aspirin. Results are available on an intention-to-treat basis. The members of the Clinical Audit Committees were blinded. In both studies, balance between treatment assignments was achieved with random permutated blocks; treatment codes were distributed centrally by telephone through a randomisation service, using pre-generated randomisation lists for each centre. The length of follow up was quite different: 2.3 year in EAFT and 1 year in SIFA (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SIFA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SIFA 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In EAFT, drop-out rate was about 10% per year in patients on warfarin and about 20% per year in aspirin patients. The most common reason for withdrawal was an outcome event, being mostly bleeding events in anticoagulated patients and a (presumed) ischemic stroke or a new indication for anticoagulation in patients on aspirin. Only two patients were lost to follow up. The mean INR in the patients assigned to anticoagulation was 2.9. Thirty two per cent of INRs were below 2.5 and 9% were above 4.0.</P>
<P>In SIFA, 41(9%) warfarin treated patients withdrew from medication and 40 (9%) indobufen treated patients. Nine patients (seven in the warfarin and two in the indobufen group) were lost to follow up. Of the 2560 INR determinations, 83.5% fell in the prespecified range, 14.1% were below 2.0 and 2.4% above 3.5.</P>
<P>Baseline characteristics were comparable between both trials and between treatment groups for age, sex fraction and cardiovascular risk factors, except for hypertension. In EAFT 43% had a history of hypertension versus 55% in SIFA. Both studies excluded patients with poorly controlled hypertension, but only EAFT gave a specific cut-off point (diastolic greater than 100 or systolic greater than 180 mmHg). Baseline mean blood pressures however were very similar: 149 ± 18 in SIFA and 146 ± 21 in EAFT.<BR/>
</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Anticoagulant therapy was significantly more effective than antiplatelet therapy in preventing all vascular events (Peto odds ration (Peto OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.91) and for recurrent stroke (Peto OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.72). Warfarin did not cause a significant increase of intracranial bleeds (Peto OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.88). Major extracranial bleeding complications occurred more often in patients on anticoagulants (Peto OR 5.16, 95% CI 2.08 to 12.83), but the absolute difference was small (2.8% per year versus 0.9% per year in EAFT and 0.9% per year versus 0% per year in SIFA).</P>
<P>The absolute risk of all vascular events in those allocated to anticoagulant therapy was similar in both studies (8% per year in EAFT and 9% per year in SIFA). In the antiplatelet allocated groups these event rates were also not significantly different (13% per year in EAFT and 11% per year in SIFA). So anticoagulant therapy was associated with 50 fewer vascular events per year per 1000 patients treated in EAFT and a statistically non-significant 20 per 1000 treated in SIFA (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-SIFA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SIFA 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The absolute risk for all recurrent strokes (hemorrhagic/ischemic/unknown type) in patients treated with anticoagulants was approximately 4% per year in both studies. In the antiplatelet treated patients, these rates were 10% per year in EAFT and only 5% per year in SIFA. Thus anticoagulant therapy was associated with 60 fewer recurrent strokes per year per 1000 patients treated in EAFT and SIFA did not show a statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The high heterogeneity for the outcome 'recurrent stroke' (73.2%) and moderate heterogeneity for the outcome 'intracranial bleeding' (53.1%) might be due to clinical heterogeneity of the patients in the two trials, somewhat different antiplatelet agents and different degrees of anticoagulation, or due to chance, as the outcomes however were measured over a different time period, as follow up was 2.3 years in EAFT and only 1 year in SIFA.<BR/>
<BR/>In EAFT, the event rate for non-vascular death was 2.1% per year in the anticoagulant group and 2.6% per year in the aspirin group. In SIFA, non-vascular deaths were not reported. Also in SIFA, 54 adverse reactions were recorded during follow up: 21 in the patients treated with indobufen (mainly stomach pain, nausea and vomiting) and 33 in those treated with warfarin (mainly bleeding complications). There were four intracranial bleeds (two major, two minor) in patients treated with warfarin and one (major) in the indobufen group. In EAFT, only one intracranial hemorrhage was recorded and this occurred in a patient treated with aspirin. <BR/> </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results show that anticoagulants are significantly more effective than antiplatelet agents in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with NRAF and recent non-disabling cerebral ischemia. There is an increase in major extracranial bleeding complications, but the overall net benefit remains as seen in the reduction of all vascular events. The difference in major bleeding complications between the two antithrombotic regimens was small. Aspirin or indobufen may be used as an alternative in NRAF patients with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment.</P>
<P>Although the results of both studies point in the same direction, the differences in event rates in the two treatment arms are much more striking in the EAFT (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>). Possible explanations could be that the higher INR in EAFT, which may have resulted in fewer ischemic strokes (16 versus 39 in EAFT and 10 versus 18 in SIFA), while still safe. Alternative explanations could be that indobufen is a more effective antiplatelet agent than aspirin. However, follow up was short in SIFA and the effect of indobufen could have been overestimated (<LINK REF="STD-SIFA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SIFA 1997</LINK>).<B> </B> </P>
<P>A theoretical disadvantage of the EAFT, but an inevitable consequence of its complicated study design, is that anticoagulant treatment was not blinded, especially since the results of the five primary prevention trials were published whilst EAFT was still ongoing. These results could have biased both the EAFT Auditing Committee and the individual investigators. However, all members of the Audit Committee that assessed outcome events were absolutely blinded for the assigned study treatment. Furthermore, the majority of recurrent vascular events in this study were major, and often fatal events, which left little room for interobserver variation.</P>
<P>The SIFA trial was also an open study, which does not allow us to rule out the potential for non blinded observer's bias affecting outcomes. However, the adverse events were independently classified by three members of the Steering Committee who were unaware of treatment allocation.</P>
<P>These studies do not provide information on the balance between risk and benefit of anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet drugs in the early period after onset after a cerebral ischemic event in a patient with atrial fibrillation. Given the high efficacy of anticoagulation, it may be that treatment should be started as soon as possible. However, several studies have recommended withholding anticoagulants during the first few days after suspected cardiogenic emboli to the brain, especially in patients with large infarcts (<LINK REF="REF-Larrue-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larrue 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 1980</LINK>). In one trial involving 449 patients, a low-molecular-weight heparin (compared to aspirin) did not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke during the first 14 days after a stroke that was attributed to atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-Berge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berge 2000</LINK>). However, in a large subgroup (3169 patients) of similar patients in a trial of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, heparin reduced the 14-day risk of ischemic stroke by more than 50%, but an increase in brain hemorrhage eliminated this benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis are in line with a recently published individual patient meta-analysis of 4052 patients with NRAF with (24%, n = 986) or without (76%) a previous stroke or TIA from six published randomised trials, in which oral anticoagulants were compared with aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Walraven 2002</LINK>). The SIFA trial was not included, as it did not test aspirin but indobufen. Of the 986 patients with previous stroke or TIA in the Van Walraven paper (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Walraven 2002</LINK>), 455 were from EAFT. The majority of other patients (n = 380) were from SPAF III (<LINK REF="REF-SPAF-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF 1996</LINK>), which compared warfarin versus aspirin plus fixed mini dose warfarin, so these patients did not meet the requirements of our review. There are an additional 151 patients with previous stroke or TIA scattered among four other trials, which we could not include as we did not have access to these data. For the next update we will try and obtain these data and include them in this analysis. Compared with aspirin, oral anticoagulant significantly decreased the risk of all strokes, ischemic strokes, and cardiovascular events but modestly increased the absolute risk of major bleeding. The relative risk reduction was similar to our meta-analysis, but was smaller in absolute terms. The explanation lies in the higher stroke risk of those with a history of stroke or TIA. They found that, in patients treated with aspirin, stroke risk was 10% per year in those with a previous stroke versus only 2.7% per year in those without and was reduced to respectively 4% per year and 1.5% per year. <BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review showed that, for patients with NRAF and a recent non-disabling stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulants were more effective than antiplatelet agents for preventing recurrent stroke and major vascular events. However, anticoagulants were associated with a significant increase in the risk of major extracranial bleeds. These data support the routine use of oral anticoagulants in patients with NRAF and a recent non-disabling stroke or TIA. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The excess of major extracranial bleeds with warfarin highlights the need to identify safer anticoagulant regimens or new agents of comparable efficacy but greater safety. Similarly, there is a need to identify more effective antiplatelet agents for use in NRAF patients who have a contraindication to oral anticoagulants.</P>
