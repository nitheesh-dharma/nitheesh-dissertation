<P>Acute myocarditis is inflammation of the heart and is thought to be most commonly begin as a viral infection. The disease affects individuals of all ages. On the basis of multiple case reports and case series, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has become part of routine practice for treating adults and children with acute myocarditis at many centres. This is an update of a previous review, which found only one randomised trial of 62 adults, suggesting that IVIG is not useful in myocarditis. A second trial was added with this update. This trial evaluated 83 children who had the relatively rare combination of myocarditis and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Investigators found a lower death rate among children receiving IVIG than in those who did not, but this study had high risk of bias. More study is required before IVIG can be routinely recommended for adults or children with myocarditis.</P>

<P>This is an update of a previous review. Case reports and case series have described dramatic responses to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in people with presumed viral myocarditis, and its administration has become commonplace.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-05 17:32:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to compare transplant-free survival of adults and children with presumed viral myocarditis treated with IVIG versus those who did not receive IVIG. A secondary objective was to determine if a group of patients with presumed viral myocarditis could be identified (on the basis of age, duration of symptoms, acuity of onset of symptoms, cardiac function at presentation, virological results or the presence or absence of histological evidence of acute myocarditis on cardiac biopsy in patients in whom a biopsy was performed) who would be the most likely to benefit from IVIG.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-31 07:29:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, review authors added one study to the study from the original review. The first relevant study involved 62 adults with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy randomly assigned to receive IVIG or an equivalent volume of 0.1% albumin in a blinded fashion. The overall risk of bias was unclear. The incidence of death or the requirement for cardiac transplant or placement of a left ventricular assist device was low in both groups (odds ratio (OR) for event-free survival 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 2.30). Follow-up at six months and at 12 months showed equivalent improvement in LVEF (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.07 at six months; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08 at 12 months). Functional capacity as assessed by peak oxygen consumption was equivalent in the two groups at 12 months (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.57 to 2.97). Infusion-related side effects were more common in the treated group, but all were reported to be mild (OR 30.16, 95% CI 1.69 to 539.42).</P>
<P>The second study added at this update included 83 children in India with suspected viral encephalitis and myocarditis. The overall risk of bias was high. The odds ratio for event-free survival was 7.39 (95% CI 0.91 to 59.86). Follow-up occurred only until hospital discharge, and LVEF was 49.5% in the treated group versus 35.9% in the placebo group (risk difference 13.6%, 95% CI 5.1 to 22.1%; P value = 0.001).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-31 07:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from one trial does not support the use of IVIG for the treatment of adults with presumed viral myocarditis. The only paediatric trial had high risk of bias but suggested that benefit may be seen in the select group of children beyond the neonatal period who have viral encephalitis with myocarditis. Until higher-quality studies have demonstrated benefit in a particular group of patients, IVIG for presumed viral myocarditis should not be provided as routine practice in any situation. Further studies of the pathophysiology of myocarditis would lead to improved diagnostic criteria, which would facilitate future research.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-31 07:41:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute myocarditis is a disease that occurs in individuals of all ages. It is presumed to start usually as a viral infection, although autoimmune and idiopathic forms also occur. It remains unclear whether the primary problem is most commonly ongoing damage from a virus, a postinfectious inflammatory reaction or a combination of the two. If ongoing infection is the primary problem, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) could be efficacious if it contains antibodies to the microbe. Intravenous immunoglobulin also has anti-inflammatory properties, so it could be efficacious even if the primary problem is a postinfectious inflammatory reaction, or a non-infectious process.</P>
<P>Multiple case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Nigro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nigro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takeda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tedeschi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tedeschi 2002</LINK>) and case series (<LINK REF="STD-Alrabate-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Alrabate 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drucker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drucker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Goland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haque-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 2009</LINK>) have described apparent dramatic responses to IVIG in adults and children with acute myocarditis, with one large case series suggesting no benefit irrespective of severity of illness (<LINK REF="STD-Klugman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klugman 2009</LINK>). However, results from a randomised controlled trial showed no advantage in treated adults with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (or in the subgroup with histological evidence of acute myocarditis) (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One problem involved in analysing the literature on treatment of patients with acute myocarditis is that the enrolment criteria for these studies are far from uniform. Reasons for this include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No reference standard has been accepted for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Detection of pathogens from cardiac tissue would represent evidence in favour of infectious myocarditis. This seldom occurs, presumably because the concentration of pathogens is typically very low by the time a biopsy is performed. The yield is improved by molecular techniques <LINK REF="REF-Guglin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guglin 2012</LINK>. However, it is not clear whether detection of latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus in cardiac tissue is always indicative of myocarditis. It has been suggested that one way to diagnose acute myocarditis is to perform cardiac biopsies at a minimum of five sites to look for histology fulfilling the Dallas criteria. These criteria require evidence of lymphocytic infiltration and myocyte necrosis with or without degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Towbin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towbin 2001</LINK>). However, studies have shown that biopsies on about half of adults with acute myocarditis at autopsy did not fulfil the Dallas criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Towbin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towbin 2001</LINK>). The reason for this is that inflammation can be patchy or transient, and can progress to fibrosis (which would not be interpreted as acute myocarditis) (<LINK REF="REF-Levi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 2001</LINK>). Therefore, many studies include patients who do not fulfil the Dallas criteria for acute myocarditis. Alternative World Heart Federation criteria require a diffuse, focal or confluent infiltrate of &#8805; 14 leucocytes/mm<SUP>2</SUP> (primarily lymphocytes with up to four macrophages/mm<SUP>2</SUP> permitted) (<LINK REF="REF-Maisch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maisch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1997</LINK>). Recent progress has been reported in the use of diagnostic imaging for diagnosis of acute myocarditis. The "Lake Louise criteria" can be applied to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of acute myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Freidrich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freidrich 2009</LINK>). As with an endomyocardial biopsy, the sensitivity of cardiac MRI is greatest if performed early in the course of myocarditis. MRI cannot distinguish viral from other forms of acute myocarditis, but MRI-guided biopsies have a higher yield than do blinded biopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Guglin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guglin 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The nomenclature of myocarditis is not yet standardised. For example, the term 'acute myocarditis' is used by some study authors to refer to all cases of active myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Fuse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuse 2000</LINK>), whereas other study authors use the term only for disease of indistinct onset, using the term 'fulminant' for cases with a distinct onset and clear evidence of a recent viral illness (<LINK REF="REF-Hare-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hare 2001</LINK>). Some study authors use the term 'acute myocarditis' for a presumed infectious process, but others include non-infectious entities. Some experts believe that infectious myocarditis progresses from a phase where viral infection dominates to a phase where autoimmunity dominates (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>). If viral replication or cytokine production persists, the patient develops a dilated cardiomyopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>). If viral replication and cytokine production cease, the patient spontaneously recovers. An alternate viewpoint is that the disease begins as rapidly progressive, acute or chronic myocarditis, and that these three presentations are not part of a continuum (<LINK REF="REF-Fenoglio-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenoglio 1983</LINK>). Because no agreement has been reached on the natural history of acute myocarditis, and no uniform classification scheme has been devised, it is not possible for studies to consistently report results of treatment for different types of myocarditis.</LI>
<LI>No consensus has been reached regarding which investigations must be done to exclude non-infectious causes of acute myocardial dysfunction. In previously well paediatric patients, a clinical diagnosis of infectious myocarditis is fairly accurate, although congenital cardiomyopathy can present acutely. In adults, ischaemic heart disease is commonly confused with viral myocarditis. Other causes of acute cardiac dysfunction include drug-induced dysfunction (from alcohol, organic solvents, cocaine or chemotherapeutic or cardiac agents), collagen vascular disease and postpartum cardiomyopathy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is not clear how acute myocarditis in children differs from acute myocarditis in adults. However one study showed that 17 of 18 adults with fulminant myocarditis survived (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>), whereas a paediatric study described survival in only two of nine infants with fulminant myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Mounts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mounts 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-03-31 08:12:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one randomised trial of IVIG in adults has been reported to date (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 2001</LINK>), enrolling 62 participants with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy. All had endomyocardial biopsies, but only 10 had cellular inflammation (four fulfilled the Dallas criteria for myocarditis, three had borderline myocarditis and three had non-specific inflammation). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 2 g/kg IVIG or an equivalent volume of 0.1% albumin in a blinded fashion.</P>
<P>The incidence of death or the requirement for cardiac transplant or placement of a left ventricular assist device was low in both groups: Event-free survival was not significantly different but favoured the control group (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.30). Follow-up at six months and at 12 months showed equivalent improvement in LVEF among cases and controls (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.07 at six months; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08 at 12 months). Functional capacity as assessed by peak oxygen consumption was equivalent in the two groups at 12 months (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.57 to 2.97). Adverse events potentially related to IVIG were more common in the treated group, and all were described as mild infusion reactions (OR for adverse events 30.16, 95% CI 1.69 to 539.42; NNTH = 3).<BR/>
</P>
<P>In the only paediatric trial to date (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatt 2012</LINK>), 26 children admitted on a Monday or a Friday with acute encephalitis and myocarditis were given IVIG 400 mg/kg for five consecutive days, and the 57 controls admitted on other days of the week received no therapy. Another seven children were excluded, as parents refused (n = 4) or they met exclusion criteria (n = 3). Enterovirus was detected in stool in eight children, and a rise in antibody titre for Coxsackie B1 was documented in seven children with no other potential etiological agents identified among the 83 children.</P>
<P>The incidence of event-free survival was 25 of 26 (96%) in the treated group and 44 of 57 (77%) in the control group (OR 7.39, 95% CI 0.91 to 59.86). Cardiac transplant and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement presumably were not available. The cause of death was cardiac in 10 of the 14 children who died (refractory congestive heart failure n = 5; refractory shock n = 3; arrhythmias n = 2), with the other four dying of cerebral herniation (n = 2) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (n = 2). Follow-up continued only until hospital discharge, so it was not as long as in our prespecified outcomes, but LVEF at discharge was 49.5% in the treated group versus 35.9% in the placebo group (risk difference (RD) 13.6%, 95% CI 5.1 to 22.1%; P value = 0.001). Length of stay and requirements for inotropes or mechanical ventilation were very similar in the two groups. The only adverse events described as potentially related to IVIG were rash (n = 1) and headache and tachycardia (n = 1) (OR for adverse events 11.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 253.54; NNTH = 13).</P>
<P>Results still have not been reported from the European Study of Epidemiology and Treatment of Cardiac Inflammatory Diseases (ESETCID) (<LINK REF="STD-Hufnagel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hufnagel 2000</LINK>). This trial involves different therapies depending on the expected pathogenesis of myocarditis, and at least one of the study arms involves immunoglobulin therapy.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-31 08:02:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only randomised controlled trial (RCT) of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in adults with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy showed no apparent benefit, but a major limitation of this study is that it seems likely that at least some of the trial participants may not have had viral myocarditis, as only 10 of 62 had inflammation on cardiac biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 2001</LINK>). However, the primary purpose of the biopsies in this trial may have been to rule out fibrosis, so fewer biopsies were taken than would have been taken had the purpose been to confirm myocarditis. This lack of benefit contrasts with multiple case reports and case series suggesting potential benefit of IVIG in suspected viral myocarditis (<LINK REF="STD-Alrabate-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Alrabate 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drucker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drucker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Goland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haque-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNamara-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nigro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nigro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takeda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tedeschi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tedeschi 2002</LINK>). Spontaneous improvement is common with acute myocarditis and can be rapid or gradual, so the improvement noted in these case series may have been part of the natural history of the disease.</P>
<P>The only paediatric RCT reported more promising results (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatt 2012</LINK>) but had high risk of bias and included only children with suspected acute encephalitis and myocarditis - a condition that is often associated with enterovirus 71 infection and occurs commonly in Asia. In other parts of the world, neonatal enteroviral infection commonly manifests with encephalitis and myocarditis, but this combined presentation is rare in older children. It is not clear why so few children in the Bhatta study had evidence of enteroviral disease. Possible explanations include that only suboptimal diagnostics were available, not all children were tested, myocarditis is primarily a postviral event or another virus was causative.</P>
<P>As acute myocarditis is a relatively non-specific entity, it is possible that a subset of patients may respond to IVIG. This group might include patients whose disease was precipitated by a specific virus, or patients treated with IVIG early in the course of their illness, when they have ongoing viral replication in the myocardium. Perhaps paediatric patients are more likely to respond, as the chance that an acute cardiomyopathy is due to viral myocarditis is greater in children than in adults.</P>
<P>One of the excluded studies warrants mention, as it may be of interest to the reader (<LINK REF="STD-Maisch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maisch 2004</LINK>). This was a controlled trial of cytomegalovirus hyperimmunoglobulin (CMVhlg), rather than IVIG, among 35 participants with CMV-positive myocarditis. Results showed a significant difference in favour of treatment in terms of elimination of CMV-DNA and infiltrate, and improvement of 1 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. In a review article, it was recently stated that data from the Marburg Registry support the notion that IVIG has efficacy for myocarditis due to adenovirus, but that for myocarditis due to parvovirus, IVIG decreases inflammation but does not eradicate the virus (<LINK REF="REF-Maisch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisch 2013</LINK>). However, in the Netherlands, an ongoing trial is examining use of IVIG among adults with chronic cardiomyopathy and detection of parvovirus B19 on endomyocardial biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00892112" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00892112</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-31 01:40:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from one trial involving 62 adults does not support the use of IVIG for the management of presumed viral myocarditis in adults, but it is not clear whether all study participants had viral myocarditis. Evidence from the only paediatric trial involving 83 children suggests that IVIG may be useful in children who have both encephalitis and myocarditis, but it is not clear whether this benefit extends to neonates with enteroviral sepsis or to older children with myocarditis alone. Further RCTs are needed. Until higher-quality studies demonstrate benefit in a particular group of patients, use of IVIG for presumed viral myocarditis should not be included as part of routine practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-31 08:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The greatest need is for further studies of the pathophysiology of acute myocarditis, which would provide a better understanding of the aetiology and natural history of the disease. This might lead to improved diagnostic criteria, which would make it much easier for researchers to design studies of treatment options. This might also lead to recognition of subgroups of patients for whom IVIG has greater potential to confer clinical benefit.</P>
