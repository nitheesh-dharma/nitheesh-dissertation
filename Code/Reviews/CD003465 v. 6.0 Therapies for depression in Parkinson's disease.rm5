<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Anti-depressant therapies may be able to help relieve depression in people with Parkinson's disease but more research is needed on safety and effectiveness.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Parkinson's disease can lead to psychiatric as well as physical symptoms, the most common of which is depression. Oral antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy or behavioural therapy are currently used in the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease. No trials were found examining the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy or behavioural therapy. We identified three trials which examined antidepressant drugs. The review found that there is not enough evidence from the trials about the effects of antidepressant drugs for the treatment of depression in people with Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects in trials so far have not been severe, and included visual hallucinations and confusion.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disturbances in Parkinson's disease. 40% of observed variation in quality of life is due to depression. However, there is little hard evidence of the efficacy and safety of antidepressant therapies in Parkinson's disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of antidepressant therapies in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Safety refers to both the direct side-effects of the therapy and also the therapy's interactions with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and with the antiparkinsonian medications.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant clinical trials were identified by electronic searches the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (the Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE(1996-2001), EMBASE (1974-2001), PsychLit (1800's-2001), CINAHL (1982-2001) databases. The reference list of all trial reports and reviews were examined. Queries were sent out to all manufacturers and distributors of antidepressants within the UK requesting information on any relevant clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining licensed oral antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or behavioural therapy in the treatment of depression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data was extracted and assessed independently by three of the authors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials were found examining oral antidepressant medications in Parkinson's disease in a total of 106 patients. No eligible trials of ECT or behavioural therapy were found. In the first arm of the crossover trial by Andersen 1980 (n=22) patients in the nortriptyline group showed a larger improvement than placebo group in median depression score in a self-made 31-item depression rating scale after 16 weeks of treatment but statistical significance was not calculated. A parallel group trial by Wermuth 1998 (n=37) did not show any statistically significant difference between the citalopram and placebo groups in the Hamilton Depression Scale after 52 weeks of treatment. The third study by Rabey 1996 (n=47) was a randomised open-label trial to compare fluvoxamine versus amitriptyline. Similar numbers of patients in amitriptyline and fluvoxamine groups (60% vs 55%) had a 50% reduction of Hamilton score after 16 months of treatment. However, further assessment of this trial was not possible because only summary results were available from an abstract and attempts to contact the authors failed. Visual hallucinations or confusion had been reported in patients with fluvoxamine and amitriptyline. Otherwise, no other major side effects were found in the other two trials. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Insufficient data on the effectiveness and safety of any antidepressants therapies in Parkinson's disease are available on which to make recommendations for their use. Further large scale randomised controlled trials are urgently required in this area.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the classic features of akinesia (encompassing hypokinesia and bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Its prevalence in Europe is around 160 per 100,000, which means there are around 120,000 people in the UK diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-EPDA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPDA 1999</LINK>). These figures are expected to rise proportionately with the increasing aging of the population worldwide. The etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is currently unclear and no cure is available. Medication is the first option of treatment and functional neurosurgery may be indicated for advanced disease or drug induced complications.</P>
<P>Physical disability greatly affects quality of life and hence has consistently been the focus of research in Parkinson's disease. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that neuropsychiatric disorders have a considerable influence on quality of life. Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disturbances in Parkinson's disease. Several studies have revealed that 40% of observed variation in quality of life can be explained by depression (<LINK REF="REF-Schrag-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrag 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Klaassen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaassen 1995</LINK>). In comparison only 17% of observed variation in quality of life in Parkinson's disease is attributed to the management of physical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-GPDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">GPDS 2000</LINK>). Depression also has an impact on the burden of caregivers. </P>
<P>The central features of depression are low mood, anhedonia (lack of enjoyment and pleasure from normally enjoyable activities) and pessimistic thoughts combined with lethargy and fatigue. Some patients may show signs of restlessness and irritability. Sleep disturbance may be present in either the form of excessive sleeping periods or waking many times throughout the night. In each case the patient does not feel refreshed when they do get up. In the depressed patient these symptoms will have been maintained for months and are usually first noticed when they affect day-to-day activities. Characteristic physical features may be apparent including weight loss, loss of appetite as well as turning downwards of the corners of the mouth and vertical furrowing of the centre of the brow, bent shoulders and lowered head. As depression increases in severity so do the associated symptoms. Lethargy and fatigue may progress to psychomotor retardation resulting in slowed reactions. Thought processes are delayed reflected in slowed speech with numerous pauses and long delays in verbal response. The cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease share common features with depression. Akinesia in Parkinsonism appears similar to psychomotor retardation; also feelings of hopelessness, disturbed sleep and anxiety may occur in Parkinson's disease. However, a review of studies on depression in Parkinson's disease has revealed that the profile of depressive symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease is not identical to that reported in patients with idiopathic depression (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1992</LINK>). Depression in Parkinson' disease shows some distinct features including preserved short term memory, no association with severity of Parkinson's symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1991</LINK>), greater anxiety and lower level of self punitive ideation. At the moment, the mechanism of depression is not clear. It may be due to an endogenous origin, a reaction to disability, an integral part of Parkinson's disease or a combination of any of these.</P>
<P>Currently three major groups of antidepressants are recognised: tricyclic and related antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, moclobemide) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. citalopram, sertraline, fluvoxamine) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2001</LINK>). Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors indiscriminately inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin increasing their functional availability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have greater potency and selectivity for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. The enhanced functional availability of noradrenaline and serotonin is detected within hours of start of treatment but the antidepressant effect of drug treatment can take several weeks. This lag is thought to be due to adaptive changes within the neurotransmitter systems involved. It has been suggested that some antidepressants (notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may exacerbate the physical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jimenez_x002d_Jimenez-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jimenez-Jimenez 1994</LINK>). All antidepressants produce unwanted effects including drowsiness, dry mouth and urinary retention and cardiac arrhythmias, gastro-intestinal upset as well as the risk of overdose in vulnerable patients. New tricyclic antidepressants (mianserin, maprotiline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors exhibit fewer side effects and may be less toxic, but have not proved to have a more rapid onset or be more efficacious. </P>
<P>Should antidepressant medications fail to control depressive symptoms or if psychotic symptoms are severe electroconvulsive therapy may be used. Cognitive behavioural therapy may aid in conjunction with antidepressants or as sole therapy in mild depression to encourage patients back into a more normal daily routine by reducing anxiety and pessimistic symptoms. </P>
<P>Although many of the above therapies have been used to treat depression in Parkinson's disease, the general perception is that little hard evidence of their efficacy and safety exists (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Klaassen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaassen 1995</LINK>). The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of these therapies in managing depression in Parkinson's disease.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. The review is based on the search strategy of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group.</P>
<P>2. A more general electronic search strategy was carried on the following databases MEDLINE(1996-2001), EMBASE (1974-2001), PsychLit (1800's-2001), CINAHL (1982-2001) using the following Mesh headings and text words:<BR/>(1) Parkinson's disease "or" Parkinsonism "or" Parkinsonian<BR/>(2) Depression "or" affective disorders "or" mood disorders<BR/>(3) 1 "and" 2<BR/>The key term "antidepressant" was cross-referenced with the results of (3). <BR/>The names of classes of antidepressants and their individual names were also cross-referenced with the results of (3); tricyclic, monoamine-oxidease inhibitors, MAOI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, SSRI, amitriptyline, amoxapine, citalopram, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, flupentixol, fluvoxamine, imipramine, isocarboxazid, lofepramine, mainserin, mirtazapine, moclobemide, nefazodone, nortriptyline, paroxetine, phenelzine, reboxetine, sertraline, tranylcypromine, trazodone, tryptophan, venlafaxine.<BR/>Key terms describing alternative therapies for the treatment of depression were also cross-referenced with the results of (3); cognitive behavioural therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, phototherapy, psychological, transcranial magnetic stimulation<BR/>These results were combined with standard search strings for clinical trials such as "randomised controlled trial", "clinical trial", "single or double or treble" and "placebo".</P>

<P>Three randomised controlled studies matched the selection criteria were identified. They all examined the efficacy and safety of oral antidepressants approved for the treatment of depression with Parkinson's disease. No eligible studies of electroconvulsive therapy and behavioural therapy were found.</P>
<P>TRIAL DESIGN<BR/>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> (nortriptyline versus placebo) was a double-blinded crossover study done in two neurological outpatient departments in Denmark. The study was completed in 16 weeks with an 8-week crossover point and washout period was not indicated. <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> performed an open-label study in Israel to compare fluvoxamine against amitriptyline but the exact study duration was not stated. <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> conducted a double-blinded controlled study with a parallel group design to test citalopram against placebo in six neurological centres in Denmark. The trial took place over a total period of 52 weeks, which was divided into an acute phase (first six weeks) and a continuation phase (the last 46 weeks).</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS<BR/>A total of 106 patients were studied in the three trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> trial, a total of 22 patients were recruited but only demographic data of 19 patients who completed the study was provided (seven women and 12 men, aged 48 to 75 years with median 59 years). They had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (as defined by the trial's authors) for a median of 6.5 years (range: 1-17 years). They were diagnosed with depression if they scored at least 13 points on the authors's unique 31-item scale. None of them were severely demented as defined by the trial's authors. <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> recruited 47 patients with a mean age of 75 years. They had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (as defined by the trial's authors) for a mean of 7 years. Depression was diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria. Seventeen of the patients were demented according to DSM-IV criteria. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> comprised 37 patients, 16 of whom were male, and with a total mean age was 64 years (range: 44-79 years). They had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease as defined by the trial's authors. Depepression was diagnosed by DSM-III-R (major depression). Demented patients were excluded from the trial.</P>
<P>INTERVENTIONS<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> trial, nortriptyline was given in a range of 25 to 150 mg daily. In <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> trial, the mean dose of fluvoxamine and amitriptyline were 78 mg and 69 mg per day respectively. The range of each drug dose was unclear. The dose of citalopram in <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> trial depended on the age and clinical response to the drug. In the acute phase citalopram 20mg daily was prescribed for those younger than 65 years old. A half dose was given for those 65 years or older. At the end of the acute phase (6 weeks) the dose of drug, citalopram or placebo, was doubled for patients who had not responded (defined as &lt;50% reduction in HAM-D score compared with baseline).</P>
<P>CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> kept the dose of levodopa constant (range 250 to 3600 mg) for each individual throughout the study. Seven patients who were on anticholinergics prior to the study had these continued for the duration of the study. In <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> trial, levodopa was given with mean dose of 500 mg per day. The dose of levodopa in <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> was not stated and dopamine agonists was allowed.</P>
<P>OUTCOMES MEASURES<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> adopted a unique 0-3 points 31 item rating scale to measure depression. A rating scale measuring neurological signs (posture, gait, akinesia, rigidity and tremor) were also used. <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> took a 50% reduction of Hamilton depression score compared with baseline as an end point for analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> employed Hamilton Depression Scale (17 items) and Melancholia Scale for psychiatric assessment and also Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for neurological assessment. A standardised side effects recording scale, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related items of Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) side effect scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>), was used in the acute phase.</P>

<P>RANDOMISATION METHOD AND CONCEALMENT OF ALLOCATION<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> used table of figures to assign the patients to two study groups randomly. The drug (nortriptyline) and placebo were prepared externally (Pharmacia Pharmaceuticals) as triplicates of identical tablets in coded boxes. However, the details of randomisation and concealment were not stated by <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK>. Consequently, selection bias may occur.</P>
<P>PATIENT NUMBERS AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS<BR/>Only 106 patients were involved and such a small number could not represent the entire population of depressed patients with Parkinson's disease.<BR/>The methods of baseline characteristics presentation varied among the trials. The authors used both mean age (<LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK>) and median age (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK>).

<P>A comparison of patients' baseline data between different treatment groups was not possible and any selection bias could no be ruled out.</P>
<P>None of the trials stated the criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Without these criteria we cannot be certain that the diagnosis was that of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and not of another of the Parkinsonian syndromes. <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> used their self-made assessment scale to identify patients with depression. This depression rating scale, to our knowledge, has not been validated, and so its specificity and reliability in diagnosing depression in Parkinson's disease is unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> used versions of the DSM (Editions III-R and IV respectively). Whilst this has the advantage of an internationally ratified set of diagnostic criteria many of the symtoms of Parkinson's disease mimic those of depression. Therefore false positive diagnoses could be created.</P>
<P>BLINDING OF ASSESSORS<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK>, the evaluation of serum levels, adjustment to the dose of nortriptyline and allocation of medicines was made by one of the authors who was not involved in the rating of patients, so as to maintain blinding. The blinding procedure was not stated by <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> trial was a open-label study. Therefore, performance bias might be introduced.</P>
<P>RESULTS<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> used a self-made 31-item scoring system to identify patients with moderate depression and monitor them throughout the study. The authors excluded certain items (retardation of thought, motor retardation, insomnia before and after midnight, genital dysfunction and diurnal variation) from the scoring system as they considered these symptoms overlapped with those of Parkinson's disease. This depression rating scale, to our knowledge, has not been validated, and so its specificity, sensitivity and reliability are unclear.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> assessed fluvoxamine with amitriptyline for the treatment of depression. However no placebo controlled trials have been performed to prove the efficacy of either drug alone, so a placebo arm would have been appropriate in this study. Without such a control arm whether the drugs had effect greater than the placebo effect is unknowable.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> was a crossover study without a washout period. The results might be compromised due to the carryover effect from the previous treatment arm. The subgroups median depression scores and their differences in each arm were listed in a table but statistical significance was not calculated. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK>, the statistical significance of the difference between the two treatment groups was unclear as well. Only <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> used the intention-to-treat to prevent from attrition bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> stated that nortriptyline significantly reduced depression (P&lt;0.001) when analysed on per protocol basis and combining the results of both arms of the cross-over trial. Nortriptyline also showed a larger improvement of median depression score over placebo in the first arm of the crossover trial (baseline median 26 for both groups, nortriptyline group 13 and placebo group 9 after treatment), but statistical significance was not calculated. The authors did not find any significant difference in posture, gait, general motility, finer movements, rigidity, akinesia or tremor.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK>'s trial, 50% of the amitriptyline group (15/27) and 60% of the fluvoxamine group (12/20) showed a 50% of decrease in Hamilton score after mean treatment period of 16 and 17 months respectively. The analysis of their results was necessarily limited as the study was only published as an abstract. A number of attempts to contact the authors failed.<BR/> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> reported only a small but significant reduction (P&lt;0.05) in the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Melancholia Scale scores in both citalopram and placebo groups between baseline and the acute phase. There was no significant difference between the placebo arm and the citalopram arm either from baseline to acute phase or to the continuation phase. This was also true for both per protocol and intention-to-treat analysis. No significant difference was observed in Parkinson's disease symptoms as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale from baseline to acute phase or to the end of the trial on either per protocol or intention-to-treat analysis. </P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS<BR/>In trial by <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK>, mean systolic blood pressure (when standing) was found to be significantly lowered with nortriptyline treatment. However, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not significantly alter in the recumbent position. Cardiac arrhythmia was not present in any of the patients and ECG results did not change during the treatment. Three patients dropped out of the trial. Two of them complained of dizziness and drop attacks at the beginning of nortriptyline treatment probably because of orthostatic hypotension due to the combined medications, and one after the crossover from the active to the placebo period, wishing to stop because of "lack of effect".</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> study, eight patients (40%) treated with fluvoxamine and 12 (45%) treated with amitriptyline dropped out. This was due to confusion and visual hallucinations in 7 fluvoxamine and 10 amitriptyline patients, somnolence in 1 amitriptyline patient, tremor in 1 fluvoxamine and mouth dryness in 1 amitriptyline patient.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> used the UKU scale to monitor side effects only in the acute phase of the trial. This showed that inner unrest (7/17), reduced duration of sleep (3/17) and headache (4/17) were more frequently observed in patients in the placebo group than in the citalopram group. In comparison diarrhoea (1/13), increased sweating (4/13), diminished sexual desire (2/13) and nausea and vomiting (3/13) were more prominent in the citalopram group.</P>
<P>EXCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>Of the total of 43 relevant clinical trials identified from the search strategy only 3 met the inclusion criteria. 40 trials were excluded because of lack of control group (22/40), use of a drug not approved for the treatment of depression (15/40), inclusion of non-depressed patients (15/40) and inclusion of patients with secondary Parkinsonism (4/40).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>PRINCIPLE FINDINGS<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials and one open-label, active comparator, randomised controlled trial were identified to examine oral antidepressant medications in treatment of depression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</LI>
<LI>All of the trials were small, and examined a total of 106 participants. Flaws in study design, results presentation and data analysis were found in all three trails.</LI>
<LI>Depressive symptoms treated with nortriptyline improved in the first half of a crossover trial with no deterioration of Parkinsonian signs.</LI>
<LI>No additional benefit of treatment with citalopram over placebo was seen in a parallel group trial. </LI>
<LI>The open-label trial of fluvoxamine compared with amitriptyline showed an approximately equal response in both groups.</LI>
<LI>Confusion and visual hallucination were occasionally reported in patients with fluvoxamine and amitriptyline. Otherwise, there were no other major side effects described but this may have been a reflection of the small size of the trials.</LI>
<LI>40 trials were excluded because of lack of control group, use of a drug not licensed for the treatment of depression, inclusion of non-depressed patients and inclusion of patients of secondary Parkinsonism.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY<BR/>All trials had small sample size and a total of 106 patients were studied. There was no indication that power calculations were used to determine the number of patients needed for an expected effect size which in essence renders the studies inappropriate. Some baseline characteristics of the participants were not clearly stated. This could have allowed selection bias to enter the study and therefore the study might not represent all patients with depression in Parkinson's disease. The methods of randomisation were unclear in both <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> trials and only <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> stated that allocation was concealed. These problems could have resulted in selection bias.</P>
<P>OUTCOMES MEASURES AND RESULTS<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> stated that nortriptyline showed a larger improvement of median depression score over placebo in the first arm of the crossover trial but statistical significance was not calculated. In <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK>'s trial, 50% of the amitriptyline group (15/27) and 60% of the fluvoxamine group (12/20) showed a 50% of decrease in Hamilton score after mean treatment period of 16 and 17 months respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> reported no significant difference between the placebo arm and the citalopram arm either from baseline to acute phase or to the continuation phase. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1980</LINK> used a self-made 31-item scoring system to identify patients with moderate depression and monitor them throughout the study. The authors excluded certain items (retardation of thought, motor retardation, insomnia before and after midnight, genital dysfunction and diurnal variation) from the scoring system as they considered these symptoms overlapped with those of Parkinson's disease. The use of a depression rating scale that, to our knowledge, has not been validated, detracts from the positive effect of nortriptyline. Besides, the study lasted for 16 weeks only with an eight weeks crossover period. This might be too short for nortriptyline to show any detectable antidepressant effect. As no indication of a washout period was made carryover effects might have been present. The way in which results from the two arms of the trial had been pooled (i.e. nortriptyline group from first half of first arm with nortriptyline group from second half of second group and likewise for the placebo groups) reflected doubts on the results due to possible contamination effects. Though a bigger improvement in depression score was found in nortriptyline group compared with placebo group in the first arm of study, the statistical significance was not calculated. </P>
<P>The comparative open-label trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rabey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rabey 1996</LINK> was published in abstract. The involvement of demented patients of unclear severity could create doubts in the accuracy of symptoms reporting. Though similar numbers of patients showed same Hamilton depression score reduction, no statistical significance was calculated. Therefore, no confident conclusion could be drawn. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wermuth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wermuth 1998</LINK> had a withdrawal rate of 19% in the acute phase which rose to 73% in the continuation phase. They used intention-to-treat analysis to try to protect against attrition bias. Intention-to-treat analysis was not adopted by authors in the other two trials which could have led to the introduction of bias.</P>
<P>None of the trials measured quality of life and health economics. Since these have clinical, social and health economics implications it is important for both doctors and patients to have this information in order to aid in making any treatment decisions. </P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS<BR/>Orthostatic hypotension was uncommon and was reported in two patients with nortriptyline treatment, which was probably due to a combination of medications. Anticholingeric side effects were rare too. Only one patient complained of mouth dryness after amitriptyline treatment. Central nervous side effects like confusion and visual hallucinations were occaisionally reported in patients taking fluvoxamine and amitriptyline. Somnolence was reported in one amitriptyline patient. No other major side effects such as drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia were found. A previous case-report found selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors could exacerbate Parkinsonian symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Jimenez_x002d_Jimenez-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jimenez-Jimenez 1994</LINK>) but no such complications were seen in citalopram and fluvoxamine treated patients. </P>
<P>EXCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>40 trials were excluded from this review. The most common reason of exclusion was lack of control group, followed by use of a drug not approved for the treatment of depression, and inclusion of non-depressed patients. We also excluded trials involving patients with secondary Parkinsonism because its etiology in depression could be different from idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>As yet there is no evidence for the efficacy of any antidepressant in the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease. No evidence was found to support the use of alternative therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). All three trials of oral antidepressants had flaws in study design, results presentation and data analysis. We were therefore unable to find sufficient data on the efficacy and safety of oral antidepressants therapies in Parkinson's disease with which to make recommendations for their use. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised double-blind crossover trial. Table of random figures used. Location: two neurological outpatient departments in Denmark. Duration total of 16 weeks, with 8 weeks crossover point. No washout period.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>22 patients with Parkinson's disease. All presented with moderate signs of depression (13 points or more on a unique 0-3-point 31-item rating scale). Two patients withdrew from the noritriptyline group and one from the placebo group. The two groups were matched in age, duration of Parkinson's disease and scores of psychiatric &amp; neurological signs. <BR/>Exclusion criteria: other somatic diseases especially of the cardiovascular system and severe dementia.<BR/>Group I: 12 patients (placebo-nortriptyline). Group II: 10 patients (nortriptyline-placebo). <BR/>19 of 22 completed the study, 7 female and 12 male, age range: 48-75 (median 59).</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Nortriptyline was given twice daily. Initial dose 50mg, gradually reached over a period of two weeks to avoid side effects. The dosage was adjusted between 25-150mg daily. Placebo tablets of identical appearance were provided in coded boxes. There were 4 different combinations: 3 tablets of placebo, 2 of placebo and one of 25mg nortriptyline, 1 of placebo and 2 of 25mg nortriptyline, and 3 of 25mg nortriptyline.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Per protocol data analysis. The individual scores for neurological signs were unchanged with both of nortriptyline and placebo. The median depression score was significantly reduced in the period of treatment on nortriptyline (pooled crossover results), P&lt;0.001. In the first arm of trial, the nortriptyline group showed a larger improvement than placebo group in the median depression score but statistical significance was not calculated. Mean standing systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced on nortriptyline treatment (pooled crossover results).</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Patients on a range of levodopa dosage, but this was kept constant for individuals throughout the trial. 7 were given anticholinergics. Items were excluded from statistical calculation from the scale arbitrarily. Authors stated the excluded items were presumed to be expression of components other than depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease.</P>

Exclusion criteria: dementia, schizophrenia, psychotic depression, severe medical disorders, alcohol or substance use disorders, current antidepressant treatment and pregnant women. The patients were comparable for depression using the Hamilton Depression Scale (mean scores: placebo 16.16, citalopram 16.61) and Melancholia Scale (mean scores: placebo 15.05, citalopram 15.11) and neurological scores using the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mean scores: placebo 33.21, citalopram 28.67). Benzodiazepines at entry were allowed to continue, necessary medication for concomitant somatic disorders including analgesics and antibiotic were allowed. Levodopa was not allowed to be changed more than 25% in the six months preceding inclusion, 25% during the first 26 weeks of the trial and a further 25% during the last 26 weeks. L-dopa dose was not changed between inclusion and week 10 unless absolutely necessary.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Dose of citalopram at baseline 20mg daily at &lt;65 years and 10mg daily &gt;65 years. At 6 weeks non-responders dose was doubled (40mg daily &gt;65 years, 20mg daily &lt;64 years)</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Acute phase: Hamilton depression scale and melancholia scale both showed statistically significant decrease in depression WITHIN both groups (P&lt;0.05), but no statistical significance BETWEEN groups either when using intention-to-treat or per protocol data analysis.<BR/>Continuation phase: No statistical significance between groups either on Hamilton depression scale or melancholia scale or Parkinson's disease scale (UPDRS) on intention-to-treat or per protocol data analysis.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Patients were evaluated using a clinical assessment and rating programme comprising the Clinicial Global Impression scale and UKU side effect scale (in addition to neurological and psychiatric scales mentioned in outcomes) at end of weeks 0 (baseline), 6, 10, 14, 26 and 52. Authors reported that during the trial it became apparent that many patients had 'recurrent brief depression' as apposed to major depression. This was confirmed by a retrospective study based on three questions from the ICD-10 criteria for Recurrent Brief Depressive Disorders.</P>
