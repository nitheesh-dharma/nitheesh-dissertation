<P>Ischaemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed countries, and the first leading cause of long-term disability in survivors. Piracetam is a drug which has been marketed by drug companies in several countries for many years as a 'nootropic' agent: a drug which has metabolic activity in the human brain. Experiments in animals suggest that piracetam could have beneficial effects in patients with acute stroke. The efficacy and safety of piracetam in patients with acute stroke have not yet been proven. There have been a number of randomised controlled trials of piracetam given to patients within 48 hours of the onset of their stroke. Data from three trials, involving 1002 patients, were available for this review, but almost all came from a single study. The data reviewed did not provide conclusive evidence about the effects of piracetam for acute stroke. One additional, large study has been conducted and interrupted by the manufacturer after some preliminary analyses were carried out, but the results have not been made available to the scientific community.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-06 16:29:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Ischaemic stroke is still the third leading cause of death in developed countries, and the first leading cause of long-term disability in survivors, but despite this there is still no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy or with a favourable risk/benefit ratio for the acute phase of the disease (aspirin has been shown to be effective, but just as an early secondary prevention treatment).</P>
<P>Various strategies are currently being considered, in relation to both circulatory impairment (e.g. antithrombotics, thrombolytics) and neuroprotection of the ischaemic brain (e.g. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) blocking agents, sodium channel blockers). Piracetam is a drug which has been marketed by drug companies in several countries for many years as a 'nootropic' agent (a drug which has metabolic activity in the human brain), and for the treatment of myoclonus. A Cochrane Review has been published on the efficacy of piracetam for ameliorating language in aphasic stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2001</LINK>); the drug has also been considered for acute stroke treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Noble-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 1996</LINK>). The exact mechanism of action of piracetam is not known and several different effects (possibly as the result of an action on a very basic cell function) have been described: a neuroprotective effect (restoration of neurotransmission, improvement of metabolism) which is evident in the presence of hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Giurgea-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giurgea 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaffler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaffler 1988</LINK>) and an antithrombotic effect (improvement of microcirculation, decrease of platelet aggregation) (<LINK REF="REF-Herrschaft-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrschaft 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moriau-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moriau 1993</LINK>). The aim of this review is to verify whether the available evidence from controlled trials is in favour of a beneficial effect of piracetam in acute ischaemic stroke. The potential effects of piracetam in chronic stroke patients is dealt with in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999, and previously updated in 2006 and 2009.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-25 15:28:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of piracetam, given within three days of stroke onset to patients with acute ischaemic stroke, in whom computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning has been performed to identify intracerebral haemorrhage. The main outcomes of interest were death from all causes and poor outcome (that is, death or dependence) at final follow-up.</P>
<P>We wished to test the following hypothesis: a policy of immediate piracetam therapy is associated with a reduced risk of being dead or dependent in activities of daily living at the end of the final follow-up (that is, a few months after stroke onset). We also wished to consider (where available) any evidence of the effect of piracetam on haemorrhagic stroke and to review the evidence, when available, on whether or not piracetam therapy increases the risk of fatal or disabling intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

<P>Two review authors (SR and MGC) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies identified from the database searches and excluded obviously irrelevant articles. We obtained the full text of the remaining articles and the same two authors independently selected studies meeting the inclusion criteria for the review. We resolved disagreement by discussion and consultation with other review authors. The same two review authors independently extracted the relevant data from each trial, including randomisation method, blinding, number of patients lost to follow up, and type of possible analysis (intention-to-treat or explanatory), and the other two review authors checked the results. We also considered the following details: the number of post-hoc exclusions, the number of patients included without a prior CT, and the number of patients randomised and analysed but not treated for whatever reason.

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-06-25 15:29:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>See '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>Only three of the 19 available studies fulfilled the entry criteria. In fact, we excluded the study by Creytens (<LINK REF="STD-Creytens-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Creytens 1980</LINK>) because there was no CT examination to allow stroke diagnosis and pathological subgroup diagnosis. All included trials used piracetam intravenously in the acute phase compared with placebo. The number of participants was 1002: ages ranged from 40 to 85 and both sexes were equally represented. In the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>) the sex ratio was almost one. CT scans were carried out for all patients participating in the two small studies, whereas, CT scans were missing in seven patients in the PASS trial, and showed a haemorrhage in 31 patients (15 piracetam and 16 placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>). These patients were included in our analysis of the single study, as it was an intention-to-treat analysis. Posterior circulation strokes were excluded as well as patients with coma (Glasgow Coma Scale less than 4) or a mass effect with a midline shift on the early scan.</P>
<P>Overall, early case fatality was 18%. The time of treatment from onset of stroke varied between 12 hours to 'preceding three days'. Although this last description was a bit unclear, we decided to include this study because it is reasonable to assume that only very few, if any, patients were treated after 48 hours. Only one study used a measure of functional disability (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>). However, this was an ad hoc modification of the Barthel score. Original data have been provided to calculate dependence, defining dependence as patients scoring less than 85 on the Barthel index.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2012-06-12 14:15:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included three trials, which met our inclusion criteria, in the analysis and summarised them in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. All were truly randomised, had adequate allocation concealment and were double blind. The reasons for excluding 16 trials from the analysis are summarised in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table. Information about the following aspects of trial quality that may relate to bias was not available from the examined trials:</P>
<OL>
<LI>any important imbalance in treatment groups;</LI>
<LI>the number of patients excluded from analysis.</LI>

<P>Adverse events were not described in the trials; it was merely stated that there was no difference between the two groups.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-06-25 15:29:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The total number of individuals included in the three trials was 1002. For the outcome of death at one month, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 3.09, df = 2, P &gt; 0.10; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 35%) even though 93% of the data came from one single trial (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>). The three trials showed a non-significant increase in the odds of early death (that is, at approximately one month) of 1.32 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.82) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); this result is almost completely based on data coming from the PASS study. However, the authors of this study controlled the possible imbalance of prognostic factors between the two groups with a logistic regression analysis. When differences in stroke severity were accounted for (214 patients in the treated group had an Orgogozo scale of less than 35, as compared to 195 in the placebo group) there was no correlation identified between the treatment group and mortality. Numbers of patients with haemorrhagic strokes or major extracranial haemorrhages were not available. Results on late death were only available for the PASS study, and were closely similar to those at one month (OR 1.32; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.80) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Results on functional disability were only reported in the PASS study, using an ad hoc modified Barthel index. The manufacturer provided analysable disability data (460 and 463 patients; four excluded because of missing data): there was a modest, non-significant reduction in the odds of being dependent with piracetam (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). When we considered poor prognosis (that is, death or dependence) there was no difference between treatment and control (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.32) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The planned sensitivity analyses were not possible because the required baseline data were not available or were not relevant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-06-25 15:29:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of this review do not show any statistically significant effect of piracetam on early or late death. There was, however, an unfavourable trend toward early death in the PASS study, which accounted for 93% of the data. This may well be due to an imbalance in stroke severity between the two groups, as stated by the authors (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>). However, very severe patients were not included in this study and therefore the imbalance in severity is based on a difference in a neurological scale which, in itself, is not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The trend towards an increased risk of early death among piracetam-allocated patients is a concern. Post hoc subgroup analysis of the PASS study (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>) suggests a benefit of very early piracetam use, a hypotheses which has been tested in PASS II (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PASS II 1998</LINK>). However, we cannot include these results in this systematic review because they have not been made available. We attempted to obtain data from the drug company which owns the interim results, but our request was refused.</P>
<P>We decided to exclude the Creytens study (<LINK REF="STD-Creytens-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Creytens 1980</LINK>) because there was no CT examination to allow stroke diagnosis and pathological subgroup diagnosis. However, if we include early death data from this study (assuming a worst-case scenario whereby missing patients are recorded as dead) the overall result does not change. If we consider data on dependence, evaluated in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-PASS-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PASS 1997</LINK>), the odds ratio is in the opposite direction but it comes close to unity when considering death plus dependence. Patients with vertebrobasilar stroke were not included in any study, and this is a further limitation of these results.</P>
<P>It seems very unlikely that any further trial comparing piracetam with control, which seeks to establish the effect of this drug in acute stroke reliably, will now be conducted.</P>

<P>Trials of piracetam do not provide definite evidence of a beneficial or harmful effect on death in acute ischaemic stroke. The available data do not support the routine use of piracetam in the management of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>If the data from PASS II were made available, it might be possible to reassess the need for further randomised controlled trials of this agent in acute stroke. However, for now, the available evidence does not suggest that further controlled trials of piracetam in acute stroke are justified.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The reviewer has given the impression that a related Cochrane protocol (Greener, Enderby and Whurr: Pharmacological treatment for aphasia following stroke) will only include patients with long-term post-stroke aphasia, and will include disability as an outcome measure. The proposed review will in fact cover patients with aphasia at any time after their stroke, and will only look at aphasia as an outcome measure.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Ms Greener is right since her review of piracetam for stroke will cover the treatment of aphasia at any time after stroke while our review deals with the effects of piracetam on functional outcome when given during the acute phase of stroke.</P>
