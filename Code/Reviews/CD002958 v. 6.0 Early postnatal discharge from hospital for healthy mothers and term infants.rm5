<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 10:18:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1970s, and earlier in some Western countries, there has been a steady decline in the length of time mothers spend in hospital after giving birth. From a standard hospital lying-in period of between eight to 14 days in the 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>), length of postnatal hospital stay for an uncomplicated vaginal birth in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States and Sweden is now around two to three days or less. In parts of the United States, hospital stays of 12 to 24 hours for uncomplicated vaginal births, and 48 to 72 hours for uncomplicated caesarean births had become standard by the mid 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Declerq-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declerq 1997</LINK>). Concern about possible adverse outcomes of early discharge led the United States Congress to pass legislation in 1996 mandating that private insurers cover postnatal stays of at least 48 hours after a vaginal birth and 96 hours after a caesarean section. However, four years later, the majority of newborn term infants were still being discharged 'early' (<LINK REF="REF-Lansky-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansky 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been considerable controversy surrounding the question of whether earlier discharge of mothers and babies is safe. The possibility that stays of shorter duration might be associated with a range of adverse outcomes for mothers and babies has been debated since the late 1950s when the first reported randomized trial of early postnatal discharge was conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). The list of potential negative consequences of earlier discharge of mothers and babies is long. Possible adverse outcomes include: delays in detecting and treating infant and maternal morbidity, greater occurrence of breastfeeding problems leading to earlier weaning, decreased maternal confidence due to lack of professional support, less maternal satisfaction with postnatal hospital care, higher prevalence of maternal depression, and increased infant and maternal readmissions (<LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1994</LINK>). Population-based studies assessing the relationship between length of postnatal hospital stay and breastfeeding initiation and duration in Australia and Sweden have found no association (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldenström 2004</LINK>), whereas a Californian study found that women who left hospital earlier than the standard length of stay of two nights for a vaginal birth, and four nights for a caesarean section, were at a slightly increased risk of ceasing breastfeeding earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Heck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heck 2003</LINK>). A series of papers appearing in the journal Pediatrics in 1995 raised concerns about early discharge leading to an increase in the number of infants developing severe hyperbilirubinemia (<LINK REF="REF-Catz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maisels-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisels 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seidman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidman 1995</LINK>). However, each of these reports was based on individual case series involving very small numbers of cases, with no adequate comparison group for assessing the contribution early discharge may have made. Several large retrospective cohort studies have investigated neonatal readmissions of infants discharged early (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>). Another large retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data for births in Washington State between 1989 and 1990 found that newborns discharged before 30 hours of age had a significantly higher rate of mortality in the first month of life, and in the first year of life, than those newborns who stayed in hospital longer (<LINK REF="REF-Malkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malkin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, not all commentators have viewed stays of shorter duration as necessarily having negative consequences for mothers and babies. Shorter length of stay has been promoted in settings such as birth centres as being consistent with a move away from an illness orientation in maternity care towards a more family-centred approach (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). From this perspective, earlier discharge of mothers and babies affords many potential advantages. These include: the opportunity for all family members to be together as they get to know the baby, contributing to improved bonding, greater involvement of the father and less sibling rivalry (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1994</LINK>); the possibility that mothers may obtain more rest and sleep in their own home environment where they are not exposed to constant interruptions and noise associated with hospital routines (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>); decreased exposure of the mother and the infant to nosocomial infections (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>); enhanced maternal confidence in caring for the baby in the home environment (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>); and potentially fewer breastfeeding problems due to less conflicting advice and less exposure of the infant to the artificial schedules imposed in the hospital environment (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). As more than one commentator has pointed out, the potential advantages of shorter postnatal hospital stays are in many respects the mirror image of the adverse outcomes identified by those with concerns for the safety of mothers and babies.</P>
<P>The concept of 'early discharge' for mothers and babies implies there is an accepted standard length of time for women to stay in hospital after giving birth. In practice, definitions of what constitutes 'early discharge' vary in different countries according to what has been the standard pattern of care in the past. In Australia, a five to seven day stay was the norm until the mid 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1997</LINK>), but in most other Western countries a shorter length of postnatal hospital stay had become standard well before this time (<LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>). As a result of these variations in practice, a length of stay of less than three days postpartum, that would have been considered standard in the late 1980s in countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, at the same time point in history would have been considered 'early discharge' in a country like Australia. This variation is reflected in the published literature on early discharge, with study participants discharged as early as 12 hours postpartum and as late as three to four days after the birth being considered in the early discharge category (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another factor which makes comparisons between studies conducted in different countries problematic is the extent to which earlier discharge is accompanied by co-interventions, for example, varying levels of antenatal preparation and post-discharge support. A recent Canadian randomized trial comparing planned early discharge (within 36 hours of the birth) with standard care (consisting of discharge within 48 to 72 hours) specified in the study protocol that women in the 'early discharge' group would receive a home visit or telephone call from an obstetric nurse within 48 hours of the birth, and on days three, five and 10 postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). The level of primary care support available to postnatal women once they leave hospital irrespective of the timing of discharge also varies considerably between countries. In the United Kingdom women are visited by a community midwife for at least the first 10 days postpartum as part of routine midwifery care (<LINK REF="REF-UKCC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKCC 1993</LINK>), and access to medical care from a general practitioner is universal and free at the point of service. Most women receive about seven midwife home visits in the first 10 to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-MacArthur-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacArthur 2002</LINK>). This high level of service provision is possibly the reason there has been much less concern about the impact of earlier discharge of mothers and babies in the United Kingdom than in countries such as the United States where access to primary care post discharge from hospital is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Declerq-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declerq 1997</LINK>). A recent population-based study of postnatal care provided to healthy newborns conducted in 19 US states found that 11% to 49% of newborn infants discharged 'early' did not receive a follow-up home visit within one week postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Lansky-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansky 2006</LINK>). To date we have not been able to locate studies documenting interventions relating to the timing of postnatal discharge of healthy mothers with term infants in countries outside Europe and North America.</P>
<P>Several systematic reviews of early postnatal discharge have been published (<LINK REF="REF-CETS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grullon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grullon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norr-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norr 1987</LINK>). The most rigorous and comprehensive of these reviews are those by Grullon and the Conseil d'Evaluation des Technologies de la Santé du Quebec (CETS). Both consider the effects on neonatal and maternal morbidity, maternal and infant readmissions, women's views of care and the issue of cost. Braveman provides a critical review of the early discharge literature with respect to infant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>). Several reviewers have deemed formal meta-analysis of the published randomized trials of early discharge inappropriate because of poor trial quality, and disparate exposures (length of stay, extent of midwifery home follow-up) and outcome measures (ways of assessing maternal and infant health problems, satisfaction with care, impact on the family and on fathers, cost, etc).</P>
<P>The only review of early postnatal discharge which includes a quantitative synthesis is the Canadian review undertaken by the Conseil d'Evaluation des Technologies de la Sante du Quebec. This review which incorporates both randomized and non-randomized studies concluded that a link between early discharge and neonatal and maternal morbidity could be neither confirmed nor ruled out (<LINK REF="REF-CETS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETS 1997</LINK>). Braveman came to a similar conclusion commenting that "early discharge of newborns and mothers affects virtually the entire medically low risk population at a vulnerable time of life but has not been subjected to the same standard of evidence for safety and efficacy required of drugs and devices" (<LINK REF="REF-Braveman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braveman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>While there are a number of other published reviews on this topic, the continuing reduction of length of postnatal stay in a number of countries and absence of clear evidence regarding safety, potential benefits for families, and costs associated with earlier postnatal discharge warrant the publication of a systematic review assessing current evidence from randomized trials.</P>

<P>The trials included in this review compare 'early postnatal discharge' with standard length of hospital stay as defined in the time and place where they were conducted. Ten trials were undertaken between 1959 and 2001 (and published between 1962 and 2005) in North America, the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Standard discharge policies in these settings varied greatly. Correspondingly, there is substantial heterogeneity in what constitutes 'early discharge' to the extent that a length of postnatal hospital stay defined as 'early discharge' in one study would have been a standard length of postnatal stay in other settings.</P>
<P>Ten trials of early postnatal discharge were identified. All are included in this review. The largest trial was published in 1962, and included 2257 women (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). The other nine trials were conducted between 1976 and 2001, and involved between 122 and 430 participants. In total 4489 women participated in trials included in this review. The study populations differed considerably between trials. Four trials recruited women after the birth. The other six trials recruited women in pregnancy. Most trials specified eligibility criteria designed to limit participation to women at lower risk of complications. One of the four trials that recruited women after they had given birth, recruited only women who had had an unplanned caesarean section. Follow-up of participants varied from three weeks to six months following childbirth.</P>
<P>In six trials randomization took place in pregnancy, usually between 30 and 38 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition of early discharge</HEADING>
<P>The definition of 'early discharge' differs across the ten trials reflecting standard practice in the settings in which they were conducted. In five of the ten trials standard practice for length of postnatal hospital stay following normal childbirth was for women to be discharged after 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). In these studies 'early discharge' was defined as somewhere between six and 48 hours following childbirth. Only three trials encouraged women in the intervention group to leave hospital earlier than 24 hours after the birth (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>). In the study conducted by Smith-Hanrahan and colleagues, standard care was for women to stay in hospital for at least 60 hours after giving birth, and early discharge was defined as less than 60 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>). In the other four studies, the standard length of postnatal hospital stay was four or more days following the birth, and 'early discharge' ranged from 12 to less than 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>In nine trials pre-randomization inclusion criteria were designed to select women at low medical risk (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). Eight of these trials recruited both women having their first or subsequent children. The trial conducted by Winterburn and colleagues recruited only women having their first child and planning to breastfeed (<LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>). Yanover and colleagues specified a number of social eligibility criteria including a requirement that prospective parents currently live together, completion of the final year of high school by mothers, and willingness of fathers to attend prenatal classes (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). The one trial that was designed to select women at higher medical risk was the study by Brooten and colleagues that recruited women who had an unplanned caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only five trials clearly documented steps taken to ensure allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). Insufficient information is available to determine the adequacy of concealment prior to randomization for the other five trials. Hellman and colleagues allocated women to control status on the basis of a series of previously designated random numbers, but it is not clear how this was administered and whether informed consent of participants was sought (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>The low participation rate in several trials limits the generalisability of the findings. Waldenström and colleagues report that out of 1604 women approached, 1440 declined to take part. The total number of women recruited and randomized was 164, or 10% of those approached (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). Gagnon and colleagues invited 1354 women to participate, 938 met inclusion criteria at the time of recruitment, and 360 agreed to take part, ie 27% of those initially approached (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). Boulvain and colleagues screened 3836 women: 2324 women met inclusion criteria and 460 women took part, ie 12% of those initially screened (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>). Carty and Bradley note that only 10% of 300 physicians who initially agreed to assist with recruitment actually referred women to the study (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). Smith-Hanrahan and colleagues report a high participation rate (90%) from eligible women who consented to meet with a nurse researcher, but do not specify how many women declined to meet with the research nurse when they were approached on the postnatal ward (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>). Other trials provide limited information about the number of women declining to participate.</P>
<P>It is not possible to blind participants or caregivers to allocation status for this intervention. It was unclear whether outcome assessment was blinded to allocation status in any of the included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Post-randomization exclusions</HEADING>
<P>Post-randomization 'exclusion' criteria were specified by three of the six studies that randomized women in pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). They included factors such as caesarean section, forceps, preterm birth, low birthweight and significant infant or maternal morbidity at the time of birth that might necessitate a longer length of stay. In the study conducted by Yanover and colleagues 10 couples did not attend prenatal classes and were deemed ineligible to continue in the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). The proportion of women excluded by post-randomization criteria in these studies ranged from 24% (46/189) in the study by Carty and Bradley to 44% (159/360) in the study conducted by Gagnon and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). Smith-Hanrahan and colleagues excluded from analysis 20 women randomized to the early discharge group who subsequently stayed longer; 18 of these women had infants requiring phototherapy for jaundice, one had a baby diagnosed with Down's syndrome, and one woman requested a longer stay (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>). Women deemed not eligible for 'early discharge' after the birth were removed from further analyses of the data in each of these studies, ie analysis was not by intention to treat (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Protocol violations and withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Not all of the included trials provide information regarding the extent to which women opted not to comply with randomization, choosing either to go home early when they had been randomized to standard care, or to stay longer when randomized to early discharge. Three trials reported substantial non-compliance, with differential cross-over between intervention and control groups. Winterburn and colleagues report that 74% of women randomized to early discharge (90/121) stayed in hospital for longer than planned, with a much smaller proportion of those randomized to a longer stay (16%, 20/127) leaving hospital early (<LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>). In the trial conducted by Smith-Hanrahan and colleagues 43% of women randomized to the control group (29/67) were subsequently sent home early because of bed shortages (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>). Boulvain and colleagues report that 50% of women in the early discharge group (114/229) stayed in hospital longer than planned, and 27.7% of women randomized to a longer stay left hospital earlier than planned (64/231) (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>). Carty and Bradley note that 10 women (5% of those randomized) did not comply with group allocation, but do not specify whether non-compliance was differential between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). Gagnon and colleagues report that 21 women withdrew (6% of women randomized), 18 of these from the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). Waldenström and colleagues report 13 withdrawals from the early discharge group (8% of women randomized) (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). Yanover reports that six women lost interest in the study and withdrew (5% of women randomized) (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Loss to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow-up from factors other than post-randomization exclusion or non-compliance with the intervention was relatively low in the trials providing this information. Six trials report no loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>) or loss to follow-up of less than 4% (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>). Yanover reports loss to follow-up of 12% (15/128) (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). Sainz Bueno reports loss to follow-up of 10.9% (37/430) (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). The other two trials give no data for the number of women unable to be followed up (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>Loss of participants from included trials occurred for a variety of reasons, including withdrawals, women failing to return questionnaires, protocol deviations and post-randomization exclusions. Relatively large numbers of women were excluded post randomization in five of the six trials that randomized women prior to the birth. Unfortunately, few trials undertook analysis retaining women who were deemed ineligible for early discharge as a result of events that occurred after randomisation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of post-randomization exclusions, withdrawals, and losses to follow up</HEADING>
<P>Of the eight trials that reported data on postrandomization exclusions, withdrawals and loss to follow up, five had greater than 20% attrition of participants (range 30.7% to 51.4%) (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Co-interventions</HEADING>
<P>There was substantial variation between trials in the extent and intensity of antenatal preparation and midwife home care following discharge offered to women in intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Two studies included antenatal home visits for women randomized to early discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>), and a third offered a prenatal 'preparation for discharge' class for women in both intervention and control arms of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Home visits by study nurses or nurse-midwives were made to women in the early discharge arms of all ten trials, although in the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>) study nurses were intended to collect information only and were requested not to provide actual nursing care or support. There was substantial variation in the nature and extent of nurse-midwife support specified in study protocols.

<P>This review has a number of specific objectives, each of which is considered in turn below.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase infant readmissions and contacts with health services after leaving hospital?</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences in infant readmissions were found in the seven trials that reported data on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). The pooled risk ratio (RR) for infant readmissions occurring within three to eight weeks postpartum was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 2.79). The conclusion was unchanged when the one trial that recruited only women who had an unplanned caesarean section was excluded from the analysis (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.45). It was not possible to conduct analyses restricted to readmissions occurring within seven days of the birth, or for readmissions within the first 28 days as no studies included sufficient detail to facilitate examining the data in this way. No trials included data on the duration of infant readmissions, or on the total duration of infant hospitalization (including the period immediately after the birth prior to discharge).</P>
<P>Brooten and colleagues found no significant difference between groups for infant 'acute care' visits in the first eight weeks postpartum among women recruited following an unplanned caesarean section (41%, 25/61 in the early discharge group versus 51%, 31/61 in standard care (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.19). Most acute care visits (71%) in the first four weeks were for 'bilirubin monitoring' or 'routine care' (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>). No other trials report data for visits to accident and emergency services. Only one trial collected information on contacts with health professionals for infant health problems in the first month (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). No significant difference was observed between early discharge and standard care (15.4%, 12/78 versus 17.5%, 17/97, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73). Carty and Bradley report on the number of physician referrals made by study nurses visiting women after discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). The proportion of infants with problems in the first ten days after the birth prompting referral to a physician in the early discharge group was 4.3% (4/93), compared with 5.2% (2/38) in standard care (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.28).</P>

The conclusion was unchanged when the one trial that recruited only women who had an unplanned caesarean section was excluded from the analysis (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.80). No trials report data on the duration of maternal readmissions or on the total duration of hospitalisation of mothers in the first six weeks after the birth.</P>
<P>Only one trial collected information on acute care visits for maternal health issues (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>). Fewer visits were made by mothers in the early discharge group in the trial which recruited women following an unplanned caesarean section: 9.8% of women in the early discharge group (6/61) made a total of 11 visits compared with 21% of women randomized to standard care (13/61) who made a total of 23 visits (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.14).</P>
<P>No trials collected information on contacts with health professionals for maternal health problems in the first six weeks after the birth. Carty and Bradley report on the number of physician referrals for maternal health issues made by study nurses visiting women in the first ten days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). The proportion of mothers with problems prompting referral to a physician in the two early discharge groups was 5.3% (5/93) compared with 7.9% (3/38) in standard care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.71). Boulvain and colleagues report visits to gynaecologists in the first month. Fifteen per cent of women in the early discharge group (33/228) made one or more visits compared with 22% (48/231) in the comparison group (RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.47 to 1.10).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase maternal health problems after the birth?</HEADING>
<P>The five trials that assessed women's emotional well-being in the months after the birth used different methods of ascertainment. Two trials used validated instruments with known sensitivity or specificity for identifying probable maternal depression in the postnatal period. Boulvain and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>) used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Sainz Bueno (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>) used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The pooled estimate for maternal depression one month after birth combining data from these two trials was RR 0.56 (95%CI 0.21 to 1.51). Carty and colleagues report a significant difference in mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory at one month postpartum favouring early discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). The mean score for women randomized to discharge within 24 hours of the birth was 4.5 (standard deviation (SD) 2.54) versus a mean score of 7.8 (SD 6.46) for women randomized to discharge four or more days after the birth (p &lt; 0.05). Higher scores on this scale indicate poorer emotional well-being. It was not possible to pool data from this trial with data from studies conducted by Sainz Bueno et al and Boulvain and colleagues as there was insufficient information about raw data provided in the paper. There is also concern about the use of the Beck Depression Inventory in the postpartum period where it performs less well than the EPDS because of its inclusion of somatic items (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1989</LINK>). Brooten and colleagues state that they found no differences between early discharge and standard care using the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist at eight weeks postpartum, but report no actual data for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>). Waldenström and colleagues assessed women's emotional well-being after the birth using a single item self-report measure that asked women to indicate if they had been depressed for two weeks or longer at any stage in the first six weeks after the birth (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). No difference was found between the early discharge and standard care groups. In the early discharge group 6% of women (3/50) reported depression lasting two weeks or longer compared with 9.2% of women (5/54) randomized to standard care.</P>
<P>Three trials reported data on tiredness and exhaustion in the first six weeks after the birth. Waldenström and colleagues compared mean values on a five-point scale that rated fatigue and alertness from 'very alert' to 'very tired' for the first 14 days postpartum. No statistically significant differences were found between groups, but women in both groups were most tired on the day following discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). Smith-Hanrahan and colleagues used a 10 centimetre visual analog scale with anchors ranging from zero (not tired, full of energy, peppy) to 10 (total exhaustion) with assessments at two to three days, one week and six weeks after the birth. No significant differences in mean scores were found between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>). Sainz Bueno and colleagues report the increase in puerperal fatigue at one month compared with one week postpartum and found no differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reports data on other maternal physical health problems in the first six weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>) showing more pathology in the control group (22.9%) compared with the intervention group (17.9%).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase maternal anxiety?</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial assessed how confident mothers felt about caring for their baby in the first month after the birth (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). Carty and Bradley used an eight-item scale to assess women's confidence about 'mothering' at one week postpartum and at one month postpartum. They report that at one week postpartum women randomized to very early discharge (12 to 24 hours) were significantly more confident about caring for their baby than women randomized to standard care (four days), with mean scores of 39.71 (SD 4.68) and 36.53 (SD 5.83) respectively (p &lt; 0.03). The clinical importance of this difference is unclear and was not addressed in the trial report. Women randomized to discharge between 25 to 48 hours after the birth also reported greater confidence about caring for their baby (mean score 38.73, SD 5.12) but this difference was not statistically significant. At one month postpartum there were no statistically significant differences between groups.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase breastfeeding problems, and/or decrease the duration of breastfeeding?</HEADING>
<P>The pooled estimate from eight trials that reported data on partial or exclusive breastfeeding at one month or two months postpartum indicated no significant difference between the early discharge group and the control group receiving standard care. Women in the early discharge group were no more or less likely not to be breastfeeding at follow-up in the first eight weeks postpartum (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06) (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>). This includes women who did not commence breastfeeding, and women who had ceased breastfeeding at the point of follow-up.</P>
<P>This result needs to be interpreted taking into account the cultural and other factors affecting breastfeeding rates in the different settings and contexts in which the trials were conducted. In studies reporting data on breastfeeding in the first one to two months postpartum, the proportion of women breastfeeding ranged from 23% in the trial conducted in New York in the 1950s to 87% in the Swiss and Spanish trials.</P>
<P>Five trials do not provide detailed information about how breastfeeding was assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Hanrahan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Hanrahan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). The other three trials each used different measures; one reports the proportion of women 'exclusively' breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>), another reports on women 'predominantly' breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>), and the third trial that recruited only women wanting to breastfeed groups together women who were exclusively or partially breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Winterburn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winterburn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials collected information on infant feeding at six months postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the early discharge and control groups in the proportion of women not breastfeeding at six months postpartum (pooled RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05).</P>
<P>Two trials reported data on infant feeding problems (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). The pooled estimate indicates no significant difference between the early discharge group and control group (RR=0.89, 95% CI 0.43 to1.86), but there was significant heterogeneity (&gt;50%) in the results for these two studies, with the recent study by Boulvain and colleagues reporting a statistically significant reduction in infant feeding problems among women in the early discharge group (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge influence women's satisfaction with postnatal care in hospital and following discharge?</HEADING>
<P>Eight out of the ten trials undertook some form of assessment of women's views of postnatal care. Five trials collected information regarding women's views of care in hospital after the birth (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). The two recent trials collected information on women's satisfaction with postnatal care in the first four to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). In the review protocol we specified that data on women's views of care would be abstracted from trials in the form of the proportion of women dissatisfied with care. Commonly, information on women's views of care is collected via questions using five or seven point scales (ratings of 'very satisfied' to 'very dissatisfied'). An a priori decision was taken to classify responses of less than 'very satisfied' as indicating a level of dissatisfaction or that some aspect of care could have been better. Comparisons of proportions were prespecified in the protocol rather than comparison of mean scores because of the difficulty of assessing the clinical significance of small statistically significant mean differences for this outcome.</P>
<P>There were four trials that reported data on women's views of postnatal care in the format specified in the protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). We have pooled the results for three of these trials. The study conducted by Hellman et al was excluded because of the likelihood that the allocation methods itself may have influenced women's views of care. Hellman et al randomly selected controls to receive standard care, and compared these women with a much larger cohort 'allocated' to 'early discharge' (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). It is not clear whether women's informed consent to the new form of care was sought, or what proportion of women were deemed ineligible. Hellman notes that a major reason for conducting the study was a shortage of cots (<LINK REF="STD-Hellman-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hellman 1962</LINK>). The pooled estimate from the three included studies gave a RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00). There is significant heterogeneity evident in the three trials included in this analysis with the results of two studies clearly favouring early discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldenström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). It is of note that in the study by Waldenstrom et al only 10% of those women approached consented to take part, and participants differed in several important respects from non-participants, including having a tendency to be more negative about care in hospital at trial entry (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). In the Spanish trial there was differential loss to follow-up between early discharge and standard care (41/213, 19.2% versus 92/217, 42.4%).</P>
<P>The three trials that report data for this outcome in the form of mean scores all found greater satisfaction with postnatal care among women randomized to early discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). Carty and Bradley measured satisfaction with postnatal care using a 22-item questionnaire specially developed for the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Carty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carty 1990</LINK>). Questions were formatted using a five-point Likert scale giving a total possible score of 110. The mean score for women randomized to leave hospital 12 to 24 hours after the birth was 96.97, SD 11.25 compared with a mean of 80.45, SD 20.96 among women in the group randomized to discharge on day four (p &lt; 0.0009). Women randomized to leaving hospital 25 to 48 hours after the birth gave intermediate ratings of care (mean 91.55, SD 16.58). Brooten and colleagues used the La Monica-Oberst Patient Satisfaction Scale to assess women's views of postnatal care in hospital following an unplanned caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>). The mean score among women in the early discharge group was 187, SD 18 versus 165, SD 25 in the group randomized to standard care. Gagnon and colleagues found greater satisfaction in the early discharge group based on a single question that asked about satisfaction with postnatal care in the first ten days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1997</LINK>). Pre-coded responses to this question were in the form of a five-point scale from 'very satisfied' to 'very dissatisfied'. The mean score in the early discharge group was 3.6, SD 0.7 compared with 3.0, SD 1.0 in the group randomized to standard care (mean difference 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9).</P>
<P>Only one trial asked women to provide an assessment of their length of stay (<LINK REF="STD-Yanover-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Yanover 1976</LINK>). Very few women in the trial conducted by Yanover and colleagues thought their length of stay too short (2/41 in the early discharge group and 1/41 in the group randomized to standard care (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.21). Slightly fewer women in the early discharge group thought their stay 'too long' (5/41 in the early discharge group versus 9/41 in the standard care group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52)).</P>
<P>No trials included measures specifically focusing on women's views of postnatal care after they left hospital.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">8. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase fathers' anxiety about caring for their baby, or decrease their involvement with the infant?</HEADING>
<P>The Swedish trial is the only study to report data on fathers' involvement in infant care. Waldenström and colleagues found that fathers' involvement was higher in the first few days after the birth in the early discharge group, both among first-time fathers and those having their second or a subsequent child (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenström 1987</LINK>). First-time fathers in the early discharge group spent an average of 183 minutes per day with their baby in the first two to four days, compared with 71 minutes for the control group (t = 4.5, P &lt; 0.001). Fathers with two or more children spent an average of 89 minutes with the new baby in the early discharge group, compared with 44 minutes in the control group (t = 2.9, P &lt; 0.01). These differences were no longer apparent at two and six weeks after the birth.</P>
<P>No trials included assessment of fathers' anxiety about caring for their infant after discharge.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Does a policy of early postnatal discharge increase the costs of pregnancy and postnatal care?</HEADING>
<P>No trials reported data on costs of pregnancy check-ups. The two more recent trials collected data on the cost of hospitalisation and community care post-discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>). In both trials the cost of hospitalisation was lower in the early discharge group. In the Spanish trial the mean cost of hospitalisation in the early discharge group was US$382.22 compared with US$647.67 in the standard care group (<LINK REF="STD-Sainz-Bueno-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sainz Bueno 2005</LINK>). In the study conducted by Boulvain et al, the mean cost of hospitalisation in the early discharge group was 5218 CHF (Swiss Francs) compared with 6772 CHF in the standard care group. In one trial the combined costs of community care and maternal and neonatal readmissions was higher in the early discharge group, and in the other costs were higher in the standard care group. Sainz Bueno and colleagues found that the combined cost of community care (including maternal and neonatal consultations and telephone calls) and maternal and neonatal readmissions was lower in the early discharge group (mean US$125.24 versus US$153.90), reflecting the higher number of maternal readmissions in the control group. The standard deviations for group means were not reported. Boulvain and colleagues report no significant mean differences in costs for maternal and neonatal readmissions or in-hosptial outpatient care between the early discharge and standard care groups, but significantly higher mean costs for community care (including midwifery, medical and allied health care) in the early discharge group (528 CHF, SD=267) compared with the standard care group (234 CHF, SD=273). Combining all these postnatal care costs, the mean costs were 932 CHF in the early discharge group compared with 481 CHF in the standard care group. Boulvain et al also measured non-medical costs attributable to health care in the first six weeks after birth (travel to health care providers, childcare support for siblings) and also the costs associated with loss of income if a partner required time off work. They found no differences between the groups in these non-medical and indirect costs. Finally, Boulvain et al report that the total mean costs were significantly lower in the early discharge group (7798 CHF, SD=6419) compared with the standard care group (9019 CHF, SD=4345) (<LINK REF="STD-Boulvain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boulvain 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>One other trial, that of Brooten et al involving women who had an unplanned caesarean section, provides some data on costs (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1994</LINK>). They found that hospitalisation charges (including labour ward charges) were significantly less in the early discharge group (intervention group mean of US$7648 versus control group mean of US$10,971). When charges were added for nurse-specialist visits (in hospital and at home), home caregiver charges, acute care visits (following discharge) and rehospitalisation charges, the difference between the intervention and control groups remained statistically significant. The intervention group mean was US$8,164 compared with a control group mean of US$11,490 (mean difference = $3,326, P &lt; 0.01). The standard deviations for group means were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Senstitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Exploratory sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the impact of a range of assumptions about differences in outcomes between intervention and control arms for participants lost to follow-up demonstrated robustness in the findings with regard to depression and breastfeeding. The findings with regard to maternal and infant re-admissions were much less robust to differing assumptions, as might be expected given the rarity of these outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sub-group analyses</HEADING>
<P>Given the small number of participants in most trials it was not possible to undertake planned sub-group analyses comparing different policies with respect to early discharge (differing lengths of stay), accompanying co-interventions (antenatal preparation or not, midwife home visits or not), primiparous versus multiparous women or vaginal versus operative births.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Assessing trial quality</HEADING>
<P>A number of factors compromise the quality of the 10 trials included in this review. Several trials report very low rates of recruitment of women approached to take part. The possibility of recruitment favouring women who either have no preference with regard to the length of time spent in hospital after the birth, or whose preference is for a short stay is therefore high. Post-randomization exclusions from participation in 'early discharge' (i.e. cross-over) in trials reporting this information account for a relatively large proportion of women randomized (24% to 44% of women). This is inevitable if randomization takes place in pregnancy, since many of the factors that may preclude a shorter length of postnatal hospital stay cannot be predicted in advance. A potential problem with post-randomization cross-over is that any effects associated with the intervention (early discharge) may be diluted by women who remain in hospital longer than planned. None of the trials that reported power calculations appeared to have taken this into account when determining sample size. In addition, seven trials reported overall loss to follow greater than 20% (range 30.7% to 51.4%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Assessing the nature of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The rationale for considering the 10 included trials as a group was that all studies were comparing policies of early discharge with standard care in the setting in which they were conducted. The trials were conducted at different times and places in the Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Standard care in these settings varied substantially, and the trials were therefore designed to evaluate very different policies of 'early discharge'. In all cases 'early discharge' was accompanied by some level of antenatal and/or post-discharge co-intervention. The extent to which opportunities for antenatal preparation and postnatal domiciliary midwife support were taken up by trial participants is poorly reported in the published accounts of the trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Maternal and infant health outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The fact that no differences are apparent in the pooled data for infant and maternal readmissions is reassuring, especially as higher rates of readmission might be expected for mothers and infants returning home sooner after the birth. The information collected regarding contacts with health services in the period immediately following discharge in the 10 trials is very variable. Making comparisons between studies is problematic because of the different levels of primary and specialist support available in different settings.</P>
<P>Although all of the included trials asked participants to complete some form of follow-up questionnaire, only six incorporated measures of maternal physical and psychological health. Concern that early discharge might contribute to higher prevalence of maternal depression is not substantiated by the findings, although only two of the trials used an instrument validated for assessing depression in the postnatal period. The impact of selecting women with a preference for shorter hospital stay cannot be discounted as a factor influencing these results and the finding of Carty and Bradley, that women in the early discharge group report greater confidence in the first week at home.</P>
<P>The pooled results of the eight studies which report data on breastfeeding for over 3800 women indicate that timing of discharge for healthy mothers of term infants does not influence the proportion of women breasfeeding at one to two months postpartum.</P>
<P>Although a number of trials incorporated measures of women's views of postnatal care, it is difficult to make comparisons between studies because of the different instruments and styles of reporting utilised in different trials. An important component of postnatal care is the support and reassurance that caregivers provide regarding care of the infant, settling techniques, infant feeding, maternal health and recovery, and the transition from hospital to home. Most trials included assessments of women's satisfaction with postnatal care in hospital, and one incorporated questions regarding length of stay. Surprisingly, none of the trials included separate measures of women's views about the availability or quality of postnatal care after discharge.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Economic outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Comparison of the costs associated with a policy of early postnatal discharge with standard care needs to take into account hospital costs, primary care support for women and infants following discharge from hospital (including midwife home visits, telephone follow-up, and other contacts with health professionals), and the costs to women and families of practical support required in the days immediately following the birth.</P>
<P>There were just three trials that provided any data on costs and these were difficult to compare due to different methods used and different costs measured. Costs of practical support post-discharge were not measured in any of the trials, although one trial did measure costs to families associated with attendance for health care (travel, childcare for siblings and time off work for partners). All three trials found that measured costs were lower in the early discharge group.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-17 02:42:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pooled trials have inadequate power to detect increases in rare outcomes, such as infant mortality and readmissions.</P>
<P>Policies of earlier postnatal discharge of healthy mothers and term infants do not appear to have adverse effects on breastfeeding or maternal depression when accompanied by a policy of offering women at least one nurse-midwife home visit post discharge.</P>
<P>Methodological limitations of included trials mean that some caution is required in drawing conclusions based on pooled estimates. There were no significant differences between the groups for any outcomes. Trends favouring the early discharge group were observed for all maternal and infant outcomes with the exception of maternal and infant readmissions, which favoured the standard care group.</P>
<P>In all ten trials included in this review early discharge was accompanied by some level of post-discharge nursing or midwifery support. In practice, policies promoting shorter length of stay may not always be implemented with accompanying primary care support in the days following discharge. It remains unclear how important home midwifery or nursing support is to the safety and acceptability of early discharge programs.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-17 02:42:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the limitations of the evidence to support the practice of early postnatal discharge, there continues to be a need for large well-designed trials of this intervention to inform current practice. Future studies should be large enough to detect important differences taking into account the likelihood of attrition resulting from post-randomization exclusions, protocol deviations (cross-over) and withdrawals. Process evaluation to assess the nature and uptake of any co-interventions is of critical importance. Use of standardized approaches to outcome assessment would greatly improve the capacity to interpret results and compare the findings of future studies.</P>
