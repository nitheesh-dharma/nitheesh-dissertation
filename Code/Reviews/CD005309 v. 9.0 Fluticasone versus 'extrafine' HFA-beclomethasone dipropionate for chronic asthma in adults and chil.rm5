I have made a few alterations to make clearer that it is being extrafine that alters dose comparison (not HFA as Clenil is HFA and not extrafine and regarded as dose equivalent to CFC-BDP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this is OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS the references have more extrafine than extra fine so I have gone for the former.

This calculator converts the risk in the placebo group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the treated group, and converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have taken DPI out of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: spellchecked and back to Toby for submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================&lt;br&gt;John White wrote 200105:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;A few thoughts/observations which I hope are helpful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Don't get too wrapped up in the &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; distribution of QVAR. just because an isotope apparently goes further into the lungs doesn't automatically make it better.&lt;br&gt;2. You need to be careful to clarify difference between QVAR and any other HFA BDP - they're almost certainly not the same.&lt;br&gt;3. Why HFA BDP vs CFC BDP? shouldn't it be HFA FP too? Not sure if these studies have been done but there are a number of FP CFC v HFA equivalence studies across the dose range. Are you happy to lump in pMDI and DPI? Need to be clear about +/- spacers if at all possible&lt;br&gt;4. Every study has a different definition of exacerbation. ? state however defined&lt;br&gt;5. Search strategy. Aside the curious change in tense it reads as if register only goes up to 1999 (for Adams99) I presume it goes right up to date - need to state.&lt;br&gt;6. You contact GSK and 3M but remember QVAR now under different owners and there are other owners of HFA BDP trials eg Chiesi I think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================================&lt;br&gt;2 Dec 2004&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the work that you have done on this. I do not mind being co-author but if so will need someone else to be editor? John White springs to mind in view of delivery device work for Sign that I have done with him.&lt;br&gt;Initial reactions are:&lt;br&gt;1. HFA BDP will need splitting into microfine QVAR (tested 1:1 with FP) and other BDP inhalers&lt;br&gt;2. Minimum duration (?12 weeks) should be specified.&lt;br&gt;3. ISR is not up to date now and current search section is past tense and needs to be updated&lt;br&gt;4. Microfine particles (QVAR) will need separate consideration - I have put this into subgroup comparisons but perhaps it should be mentioned in Interventions?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;Old title: Fluticasone versus HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate for chronic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Fluticasone versus HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate for chronic asthma (WITH JOHN WHITE)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Inhaled fluticasone versus HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate for chronic asthma in adults and children&lt;br&gt;************&lt;br&gt;SS section &amp;amp; refs. checked Liz 22/07/05&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone versus HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate for chronic asthma in adults and children (WITH CHRIS 220705)&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Fluticasone versus HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate for chronic asthma in adults and children (PEER REVIEW WITH CHRIS 150805)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 17:07:05 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="HFA-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:05:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Inhaler devices used to deliver steroids in asthma broadly fall into three categories. Those which use a propellant to dispense the steroid in to the airway via the mouth when the canister is pressed manually (pressurised metered dose inhalers - pMDIs), those which use a propellant to deliver a dose of the steroid triggered by the user breathing in (breath actuated MDIs), and those which deliver the drug as dry powder (DPI). The pMDIs have traditionally used a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant, but the phasing out of CFC-inhalers has had major implications for the manufacturing of inhaled drugs. A new non-CFC propellant (hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA)) has been introduced, and it is used to propel beclomethasone (BDP). Previously fluticasone (FP) was thought to be at least as effective as CFC-BDP when given at half the dose. The review of studies found that there was a limited amount of evidence to show that the newer extra-fine form of BDP was similar to FP at the same dose. More research should be done in children and in people with more severe asthma to help answer the question of what the relative effects of these two steroids are. Some people may not be particularly good at using certain inhaler types and the findings of the review may only really apply to people who are competent in using metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). Studies should consider introducing spacers where people find these easier to use.</P>

<P>The relative efficacy of fluticasone (FP) and beclomethasone (BDP) propelled with CFCs has been well established.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-13 11:23:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched using pre-specified terms. Searches were current as of January 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. We compared either CFC or HFA-propelled FP with HFA-propelled extrafine BDP. We made a distinction between HFA-BDP and HFA-BDP extrafine, which dispenses smaller particles of drug, leading to different, usually more peripheral distribution in the airways. Any inhaler device was considered, and there was no restriction on studies with or without spacers. We included studies which assessed HFA-BDP given via either pMDI, breath-actuated MDI, or DPI.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-13 11:23:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted and entered in to RevMan 5 using standard meta-analytical techniques with predefined criteria for exploring statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:28:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Nine studies (1265 participants) met the inclusion criteria of the review. Two studies were conducted in children. Study reporting quality was fair, but all studies were of short duration (three to twelve weeks). Lung function was not significantly different between extrafine BDP and FP when compared at the same dose in parallel studies, change in FEV1: 0.04 litres (95% CI -0.03 to 0.11 litres; three studies, 659 adults); change in FEV1 predicted: -2.18% (95% CI -4.62 to 0.26; three studies, 334 adults); change in am PEF: -0.69 litres (95% CI -11.21 to 9.83 litres; two studies, 364 adults). Individual studies reported non-significant findings in symptom scores and quality of life questionnaires. There was no significant difference between FP and extrafine HFA-BDP in the risk of study withdrawal, dysphonia or when data were reported as any adverse event.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:29:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>There was no significant difference between FP and extrafine HFA-BDP on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or peak flow at a dose ratio of 1:1. However, the number of studies and width of the confidence intervals in the analyses do not exclude a clinically meaningful difference between these two drugs. Difficulty in the successful manipulation of the devices studied may be a barrier to the widespread use of MDIs. Only two small paediatric studies were included in the review, so extrapolation of the findings of this review to children is limited. Further longer term studies in adults and children with moderate and severe asthma are required.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-04 17:07:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:25:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Several systematic reviews have established the efficacy of inhaled fluticasone (FP) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008a</LINK>), beclomethasone (BDP) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999b</LINK>) and budesonide (BUD) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999a</LINK>) in the treatment of chronic asthma. Many international guidelines emphasize the utility of front-line treatment with inhaled corticosteroids as an effective means of controlling persistent asthma by preventing exacerbations requiring oral steroid treatment, and improving airway calibre (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2002</LINK>). Some people may not find inhaler device manipulation easy, and in these patients spacers are often recommended although they may find this inconvenient to carry around (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until recently, propellants used in pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) devices were the greenhouse gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), and recent meta-analyses indicate that where CFC propelled FP and BDP or BUD are compared, FP is at least equipotent at half the dose of BDP or BUD (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>). Following concerns over the impact of these propellants on the environment, a phased ban due to the Montreal protocol has led to the development of a new CFC-free propellant (hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA)).</P>
<P>New preparations of BDP with HFA propellant may differ in efficacy from previous preparations, in particular one novel agent marketed as 'QVAR'&#8482; produces drug particles that are smaller, meaning that there may be altered deposition of the drug in the lung. Early studies in healthy volunteers and people with asthma demonstrated more widespread deposition of the smaller steroid particles in the lung with QVAR compared with CFC-BDP (<LINK REF="REF-Leach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1998</LINK>). One large clinical trial comparing QVAR with CFC-BDP has established that there was no significant difference between QVAR at 400 mcg/day and CFC-BDP given at 800 mcg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently QVAR is widely available in the UK, and national guidance recommends that in substituting patients from CFC propelled steroid therapies, QVAR can replace FP in well controlled and poorly controlled asthma at a dose ratio of 1:1 (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>). It is recommended at the same dose as CFC-BDP/BUD in poorly controlled asthma, and at half the dose only in well controlled asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>). This may not apply however to other HFA-BDP formulations.</P>
<P>Due to the proven association between inhaled steroids and oropharyngeal side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008a</LINK>), and given concern to minimise side-effects in general, there is a rationale for down-titrating the dose of steroids provided asthma control can be retained (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>). Such an approach is recommended in clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). This has led to renewed interest in the question of the relative effects of BDP and FP. Given that HFA-BDP may be cheaper than FP (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>), there may be good reason to recommend this preparation of BDP over FP if similar effects are observed at equivalent doses. However, such a recommendation assumes that HFA-FP and CFC-FP confer the same efficacy at the same dose. One 12-week crossover study comparing HFA-FP and CFC-FP concluded that at a dose of 200 mcg HFA-FP and CFC-FP conferred similar benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Ayres-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayres 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the relative effects of FP and BDP are well established (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>), there is a need to revisit this question in the light of the new propellants. </P>

<P>For continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (for outcomes reported in the same scale) or the standardised mean difference (for outcomes reported in different scales) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.</P>
<P>Where data are only available as means and 95% confidence intervals, we extracted the mean difference and calculate the standard error (SEM) based upon the confidence intervals to generate a generic inverse variance (GIV) estimate.</P>
<P>We analysed data from crossover trials with the generic inverse variance outcome. We extracted the difference between means of treatment and control groups, but used the published P value to calculate a SEM if this was from a paired T-test. We attempted to obtain unpublished data from trialists if this was not available.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the relative risk was calculated with 95% confidence interval. The event rates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. exacerbations, side-effects) may be higher and therefore more precise in studies of longer duration, where exposure to the risk of an event is greater. For such studies, the length of exposure to treatment was considered as the basis for possible subgroup analysis. For exacerbations, the recruitment of symptomatic participants at baseline may also increase event rates in both treatment groups. Additionally, the definition of 'asthma exacerbations' may vary between the studies, introducing further variability in baseline risks between the studies. We pooled studies on the basis of whether they stipulate the number of participants requiring a course of oral steroids, or requiring increase in inhaled steroids. Studies which recorded exacerbations as the number of hospitalisations, admission to hospital or unscheduled medical contact, were pooled with studies where exacerbations are defined differently.</P>
<P>Numbers needed to treat for benefit and harm, NNT(B) and NNT(H), were calculated from the pooled odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator Visual Rx (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). This calculator converts the risk in the placebo group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the treated group, and converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:29:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review has assembled data from nine clinical trials recruiting largely adult populations with moderate asthma. Two paediatric studies contributed a limited amount of data and more assessment of these drugs in children is required. The HFA-BDP used in all the studies was extrafine BDP, a preparation which may have better deposition in the small airway in the lung due to its small particle size, than other BDP preparations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schayck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schayck 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Schayck-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schayck 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall the relative effects of these drugs were similar on outcomes where data were available. Lung function assessment indicated that change in FEV1 was similar, but did not exclude the possibility of a meaningful benefit for FP (upper CI limit 0.11 L). The data on morning peak flow were more equivocal and this represents an area where additional trial data will be most usefully added. Despite being a co-primary outcome in this review, detailed outcome data on exacerbations were rarely reported. Data on other outcomes were sparse and it is anticipated that additional studies (as well as data from those studies already undertaken when these are available) will help to provide a more authoritative indication of the relative effects of FP and HFA-BDP. This may also reflect the aims of the studies which were primarily to demonstrate 'equivalence' on lung function outcomes, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Molimard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Molimard 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>Tolerability is an important aspect of steroid therapy. It is widely known that symptoms such as oral candidiasis, dysphonia and headaches can often occur in people who are on inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). The rate of adverse events between the two treatments was similar where these data were available, but the absence of studies over 3 months in duration may explain the apparently low instance of side-effects in the studies. There are concerns over growth retardation in children managed with inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>), and the lack of trials comparing the relative effects of these drugs in children means that current FP:HFA-BDP dose ratio calculations are drawn from clinical trials recruiting adults.</P>
<P>Establishing relative efficacy between two active treatments is potentially of immense clinical value, as the comparison represents a 'real world' choice between available interventions. Where adequate adherence encompasses manipulation of drug delivery devices, there is an additional need to consider how competent people are in using their device correctly. Poor inhaler device technique can adversely affect the delivery of steroid particles in the lung, irrespective of whether patients are adherent with dosing strategies, and whether their technique is observed in a clinic setting (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2005</LINK>). Evidence from a systematic review on the effects of MDIs and DPIs suggested equivalence between these two devices in delivering steroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklebank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklebank 2001</LINK>). However, the competence in inhaler technique of the populations represented in the review may have affected the extrapolation of the findings to everyday clinical experience (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melani 2004</LINK>). Data from a large observational study in adults with respiratory disease indicate that many people who use MDIs do so incorrectly, and may not therefore derive full benefit from the drugs dispensed (<LINK REF="REF-Melani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melani 2004</LINK>). Offering spacers to these patients may be a solution to this problem, but does not guarantee increased uptake as the inconvenient size and shape of some of these devices can outweigh potential benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melani 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>For reasons outlined above, the relevance of the findings of this review are restricted. <LINK REF="STD-Aubier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 2001</LINK> excluded individuals with poor inhaler technique, and <LINK REF="STD-Fairfax-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfax 2001</LINK> offered instruction in the use of pMDIs if this was necessary prior to run-in. Only Huchon 2003a recruited participants with poor inhaler technique. Particularly compliant patients may be expected to participate in a study such as that by <LINK REF="STD-Fairfax-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfax 2001</LINK>, where more than one inhaler device is used in a double-dummy setting, and those continuing with treatment may be able to manipulate both devices. <LINK REF="STD-Molimard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Molimard 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Aubier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 2001</LINK> undertook open label trials but may be prone to a different kind of bias, in that participants would have known which steroid they were receiving. These difficulties limit the generalisability of the results of individual studies. Preference data from Huchon 2003a suggested that the HFA-BDP device and associated spacer was more popular than the FP device and its equivalent spacer. Although the Volumatic Spacer was no longer being manufactured in the UK in 2005 it is due to become available again in 2006. Long-term data in patients who have poor inhaler technique at baseline are required before preference can be taken to be a surrogate for initial uptake and continued usage.</P>
<P>In spite of attempts to contact trialists, we have not been successful to date in obtaining additional data from the studies in the review. This does undermine some of the outcomes in the review, particularly that of exacerbations, where we were unable to obtain data. Equivalence should not necessarily be restricted to one outcome, especially where other clinical outcomes such as symptoms, exacerbations and quality of life are not commonly reported, and may provide a more subjective assessment of health. The design characteristics of the available studies, including the use of open label designs, leave some uncertainty over the strength of the available evidence. The absence of meaningful outcome data from paediatric studies also means that the findings of the review should not be generalised to children.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-16 13:41:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The available evidence indicates that there is currently no statistically significant difference between FP and extrafine HFA-BDP in terms of change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> over a period of 6-12 weeks in adults with moderate to severe asthma (doses of 1000 mcg/day of FP and 800 mcg/day of BDP). This should not be interpreted as equivalence, as we could not exclude meaningful benefit for FP over HFA-BDP. Furthermore there is an uncertainty over how reliable the studies are in view of their design. The absence of paediatric data precludes us from generalising the findings to children. The assembled studies did not adequately control for inhaler device technique, and this may have implications for the widespread use of the metered-dose inhalers, irrespective of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the steroid they dispense. This review has not been able to assemble data on additional clinical outcomes which are potentially relevant in answering the question of relative efficacy of these drugs, such as exacerbations and symptoms. Where reported, side effects were similar. The reported effects from the studies we have included require validation with further studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-09 16:08:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The following should be considered in future trials:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Studies of longer than three months duration are needed to compare the relative benefits and side-effect profiles of these drugs.</LI>
<LI>The studies assessed dose ranges of around 1000 mcg/day of FP. More studies assessing 1:1 dose ratios of FP and BDP in lower ranges are required.</LI>
<LI>Studies in children are required, and in particular studies in children under the age of 12 who are not recruited in studies where adolescents and adults are enrolled.</LI>
<LI>Adequate measurement and reporting of important markers of disease such as symptoms, exacerbations and adverse events (such as growth velocity in children) would also assist decisions on which of these steroids would be appropriate in the general asthma population.</LI>
<LI>Inhaler device technique needs to be taken into consideration in future trials; this may affect compliance, and the effects reported in the studies. Rather than exclude people who find MDIs difficult to use, study criteria should be flexible enough to permit the addition of spacers if necessary, provided that this does not represent a change in regular drug administration.</LI>
<LI>Patients with severe asthma, who could benefit from 'stepping down' to a lower dose of BDP should feature more frequently in studies.</LI>
