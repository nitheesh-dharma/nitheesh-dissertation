<P>This review updates the review "Prophylactic intravenous antifungal agents to prevent mortality and morbidity in very low birth weight infants" published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>For this update, the title was changed to "Prophylactic systemic antifungal agents to prevent mortality and morbidity in very low birth weight infants" since this better reflects the clinical context. Consequently, one small trial in which a systemic antifungal agent was administered enterally is now included (Violaris 1998).<BR/>
<BR/>The electronic search was updated in May 2007. Two new trials that fulfilled eligibility criteria were identified. One of these is the largest trial of this intervention yet reported (<LINK REF="STD-Manzoni-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Manzoni 2007a</LINK>). Inclusion of this trial more than doubled the total number of participants in the review. Inclusion of the data in the meta-analyses increased the precision of the estimates of effect size. The finding of a reduced incidence of invasive fungal infection in infants who received systemic antifungal prophylaxis was not altered. However, the previous finding of a statistically significantly lower mortality rate no longer holds.<BR/>
<BR/>Six observational studies of the intervention were found and we have described these in the excluded studies section.</P>

<P>Review question: In very low birth weight infants, does the use of prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity?</P>
<P>Background: Fungi such as candida (the organism that causes thrush) can cause severe infections in very low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 1.5 kg). These infections are often difficult to diagnose. It may be appropriate to attempt to prevent such infections by giving all very low birth weight infants antifungal drugs as a routine part of their care (systemic antifungal prophylaxis). This review assessed whether evidence exists that such a practice prevents severe fungal infection, death, and disability in very low birth weight infants.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: We identified 15 eligible trials enrolling a total of 1690 infants. These trials were generally of good quality.</P>
<P>Key findings: The overall analysis showed a reduction in the risk of severe fungal infection in infants who received systemic antifungal prophylaxis but did not show a difference in the risk of death. The trials did not assess the risk of long-term problems, including disabilities.</P>
<P>Conclusions: There is evidence from some good-quality trials that giving infants an antifungal drug regularly for the first four to six weeks after birth reduces the number of infants who develop severe infection. There is not yet any convincing evidence that death or disability rates are affected.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-07 21:20:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 15 eligible trials enrolling a total of 1690 infants. Ten trials (1371 infants) compared systemic antifungal prophylaxis versus placebo or no drug. These trials were generally of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis found a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of invasive fungal infection (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.59; risk difference (RD) &#8722;0.09, 95% CI &#8722;0.12 to &#8722;0.06). The average incidence of invasive fungal infection in the control groups of the trials (16%) was much higher than that generally reported from large cohort studies. Meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in the risk of death prior to hospital discharge (typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02; typical RD &#8722;0.04, 95% CI &#8722;0.07 to 0.00). Very limited data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were available. Three trials that compared systemic versus oral or topical non-absorbed antifungal prophylaxis did not detect any statistically significant effects on invasive fungal infection or mortality. Two trials that compared different dose regimens of prophylactic intravenous fluconazole did not detect any significant differences in infection rates or mortality.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-31 10:53:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy reduces the incidence of invasive fungal infection in very preterm or very low birth weight infants. This finding should be interpreted and applied cautiously since the incidence of invasive fungal infection was very high in the control groups of many of the included trials. Meta-analysis does not demonstrate a statistically significant effect on mortality. There are currently only limited data on the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences for infants exposed to this intervention. In addition, there is a need for further data on the effect of the intervention on the emergence of organisms with antifungal resistance.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-12 15:55:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive fungal infection, predominantly due to Candida species, is an increasingly common cause of mortality and morbidity in very preterm (less than 32 weeks) and very low birth weight (VLBW less than 1500 grams) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kossoff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kossoff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hornik-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornik 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wynn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wynn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeser-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeser 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shane 2013</LINK>). Invasive fungal infection accounts for about 10% of all cases of late-onset invasive infection (diagnosed more than 72 hours after birth) in newborn infants. The risk of infection is inversely related to gestational age and birth weight. The reported incidence in very preterm or VLBW infants is about 1% to 5%. In extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW less than 1000 grams) infants, incidences from 2% to 10% are reported and much higher incidences, up to 20%, have been reported for infants with birth weight less than 750 grams or gestational age at birth less than 26 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karlowicz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlowicz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makhoul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makhoul 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergnano-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergnano 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aliaga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aliaga 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional putative risk factors for invasive fungal infection in very preterm or VLBW infants include fungal colonisation at multiple sites, severe illness at birth, exposure to multiple courses of antibiotics, receipt of parenteral nutrition, the presence of a central venous catheter, preceding necrotising enterocolitis, and exposure to histamine receptor subtype 2 antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manzoni-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzoni 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barton-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeser-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeser 2014</LINK>). Between-centre differences in the incidence of invasive fungal infection may be due to all or some of these population characteristics and clinical practices.</P>
<P>In addition to fungaemia, infants may develop fungal pneumonia, meningitis, renal tract infection, ophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, liver abscesses and skin abscesses (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2006</LINK>). The diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in very preterm or VLBW infants is often delayed because the clinical presentation can be similar to bacterial infections and because of difficulties in consistently recovering the infecting organisms from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine (<LINK REF="REF-Camacho_x002d_Gonzalez-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camacho-Gonzalez 2013</LINK>). A high index of suspicion and the use of additional laboratory and clinical tests, including retinal examination, echocardiography, and renal ultrasonography, may be needed to confirm the suspected diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeser-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeser 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality attributed to invasive fungal infection is more than 25%, higher than mortality attributed to late-onset invasive bacterial infection in very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makhoul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makhoul 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ascher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher 2012</LINK>). Invasive fungal infection, particularly fungal meningitis, is also associated with long-term morbidity, including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wynn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wynn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barton-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-12 15:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the high mortality and morbidity associated with invasive fungal infection, and the difficulty in confirming a diagnosis, antifungal medications are frequently used as chemoprophylaxis against fungal colonisation and invasive fungal infection in very preterm or VLBW infants. Two broad chemoprophylactic strategies are employed in current clinical practice:</P>
<UL>
<LI>prophylaxis using oral or<I> topical non-absorbed </I>agents such as nystatin or miconazole. This intervention is assessed in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>prophylaxis using <I>systemically-absorbed </I>antifungal drugs that achieve fungicidal concentrations in tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. Over the past 15 years, the prophylactic use of systemic antifungal agents, most commonly fluconazole or amphotericin B, has been adopted as routine practice in some neonatal centres (<LINK REF="REF-Burwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burwell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaguelidou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaguelidou 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeser-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeser 2014</LINK>,). This intervention is the subject of this Cochrane review.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fluconazole</HEADING>
<P>Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal which can be administered intravenously but is also well absorbed enterally. Fluconazole achieves good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and is excreted unchanged in the urine. Fluconazole is used commonly in neonatal practice and appears to be a safe treatment for newborn infants. The most frequently reported side effect is transient elevation of plasma levels of creatinine or hepatic enzymes described in about 5% of infants treated with fluconazole (<LINK REF="REF-Huttova-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huttova 1998</LINK>). There have also been adverse events including Stevens&#8211;Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic shock, and lengthening of the electrocardiogram QT interval reported in infants and other populations of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gussenhoven-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gussenhoven 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aydin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aydin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koklu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koklu 2014</LINK>). Additionally, there is a potential risk of adverse effects as a result of drug interactions with medications that are prescribed for newborn infants, including cisapride, theophylline and thiazide diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-Neely-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Amphotericin B</HEADING>
<P>Amphotericin B, a polyene antifungal agent that reacts with sterols in cell membranes to cause cell lysis, is poorly absorbed via the enteral route and is given as an intravenous preparation. Drug toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity, is a potential problem as amphotericin B also damages mammalian cell membranes. These adverse effects limit the total dose that may be given. Newer lipid complex formulations of amphotericin B deliver the active drug directly to the site of action on the fungal cell membrane. Because the lipid complex is more stable in mammalian cells, toxicity is reduced. Amphotericin B is highly protein-bound and does not achieve good penetration into extracellular fluid spaces, including cerebrospinal fluid.</P>

<P>Given the difficulty in establishing an early diagnosis and the high level of associated morbidity and mortality, there is a need to assess the effect of strategies to prevent invasive fungal infection in very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Brecht-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brecht 2009</LINK>). This review aimed to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine that systemic antifungal prophylaxis prevents invasive fungal infection and reduces mortality and morbidity in very preterm or VLBW infants. A further major consideration is the potential for antimicrobial prophylaxis to drive the emergence of drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-02 16:05:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available trial data indicate that prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy reduces the incidence of invasive fungal infection in VLBW infants. The pooled estimate suggests that treating 11 VLBW infants with prophylactic antifungal therapy would prevent one extra case of invasive fungal infection. Meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality and there were few data reported on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
<P>We found limited trial data on outcomes for VLBW infants who received systemic versus oral or topical non-absorbed antifungal prophylaxis. The three trials that examined this question did not find any statistically significant differences in the primary outcomes, but larger trials would be needed to exclude more modest yet important effect sizes. Similarly, the currently available trial data are insufficient to determine which dose regimens of antifungal prophylaxis are superior.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">High incidence of invasive fungal infection in controls</HEADING>
<P>The main factor limiting generalisabilty of the findings of this review is the high incidence of invasive fungal infection in the placebo groups of some of the included trials. The average incidence of invasive fungal infection was 16% (range 4% to 43%) compared to incidences of 1% to 5% generally reported from other large cohort studies of VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kossoff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kossoff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karlowicz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlowicz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergnano-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergnano 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aliaga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aliaga 2014</LINK>). Consequently the effect size estimates from the meta-analyses should be applied cautiously. In neonatal care centres where the incidence of invasive fungal infection is lower, a much larger number of infants than the number derived from the meta-analysis would need to be exposed to prophylaxis to prevent a single extra case of invasive fungal infection. For example, 1% of VLBW infants and 2% of ELBW infants in a UK prospective national surveillance study developed invasive fungal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2006</LINK>). In neonatal care centres where the incidence of invasive fungal infection matches this UK national estimate, 175 VLBW (or 88 ELBW) infants would need to be exposed to systemic antifungal prophylaxis in order to prevent a single extra case of invasive fungal infection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnostic sensitivity of microbiological culture affected by systemic antifungal prophylaxis</HEADING>
<P>Another issue that may limit the validity of these trial data is that the diagnostic sensitivity of microbiological culture for invasive fungal infection may be lower in infants receiving systemic antifungal treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Schelonka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schelonka 2003</LINK>). This may have caused selective under-diagnosis in the treatment group and over-estimation of the effect size. Mortality was included as a primary outcome for this review since ascertaining this outcome is less likely to be affected by bias. Furthermore, as it is often difficult to precisely define the cause of death in VLBW infants, and since invasive fungal infection is not always diagnosed, all-cause mortality rather than death attributed to fungal infection was the pre-specified outcome. The mortality rates in the placebo cohorts were similar to rates in large cohort studies of VLBW infants cared for in similar settings (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 2002</LINK>). The review did not find a statistically significant effect of prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy on all-cause mortality, with the 95% CI around this estimate of effect consistent with a 19% risk reduction to a 7% risk increase. When data from further trials are available, these may be included in this meta-analysis to provide a more precise estimate of the effect on mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lack of data on antifungal resistance</HEADING>
<P>There is a possibility that widespread use of systemic antifungal prophylaxis may lead to the emergence of antifungal resistance. A meta-analysis of trials of fluconazole prophylaxis in immunosuppressed adults found evidence of an increased risk for colonisation, but not invasive infection, with fungi partially or completely resistant to fluconazole (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 2007</LINK>). Although the data available from the trials identified in this review are reassuring in terms of the emergence of fluconazole resistance, the follow-up periods (up to 30 months) of the trials are probably insufficient to detect clinically significant changes in the resistance profile of fungal isolates. Antifungal resistance may take many years following the introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis to become established in neonatal intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-Sarvikivi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarvikivi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial undertaken in an Indian neonatal care centre where fluconazole had been used routinely for treating infants with fungal infection during the preceding six years, the most common fungal isolates causing invasive infection were non-<I>albicans</I> <I>Candida</I> species with relatively reduced azole susceptibility (<LINK REF="STD-Parikh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Parikh 2007</LINK>). This may partly explain why this trial did not detect a statistically significant effect of fluconazole prophylaxis on the incidence of invasive fungal infection. Continued mycological surveillance in those units where systemic antifungal prophylaxis is used is essential.</P>
<P>Regarding the potential adverse effects of prophylactic systemic antifungal therapy, there were no clinically significant drug-related adverse events reported in these trials, nor was any infant withdrawn from any study because of unacceptable adverse reactions. To date, fluconazole has appeared to be a safe treatment for newborn infants with invasive fungal infection. Only a mild and transient elevation of plasma levels of hepatic enzymes has been described as a common side effect (<LINK REF="REF-Huttova-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huttova 1998</LINK>). However, there are rare but important side effects such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#8211;Johnson syndrome reported in other populations of patients. If fluconazole exposure becomes more widespread through use as prophylaxis then these side effects may be observed in newborn infants. Additionally, widespread use of prophylactic fluconazole may increase the risk of potential drug interactions with medications that are prescribed for VLBW infants including theophylline and thiazide diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-Neely-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely 2001</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-12 17:10:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials, although small, were generally of good methodological quality with satisfactory allocation concealment and blinding using placebo in most cases. Assessment of in-hospital outcomes was complete in all of the trials (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Only very limited data on long-term outcomes and on the emergence of antifungal resistance are available.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-10-12 17:21:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The existence of substantial statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of the effect of antifungal prophylaxis on the incidence of invasive fungal infection raises concern that the estimate is not robust. The source of heterogeneity does not appear to be due to differences in either the participants or the intervention, or related to trial design or quality. One exception is the trial undertaken in India in which the most common fungal isolates causing invasive infection were non-<I>albicans Candida</I> species with relatively reduced azole susceptibility (<LINK REF="STD-Parikh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Parikh 2007</LINK>). Removal of this trial from the meta-analysis removed the statistical heterogeneity of the RR estimate and did not change the direction or size of the estimate.</P>
<P>Concern exists that widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis may drive the emergence of antifungal-resistant species in the neonatal care centre. Limiting prophylaxis to infants at highest risk may help delay the emergence of antifungal resistance. Since invasive fungal infection is about twice as common in ELBW than VLBW infants, targeting prophylaxis to this population reduces the number of infants who need to be exposed to prophylaxis. Insufficient subgroup data were available to undertake the planned subgroup analysis of ELBW infants. If these data become available, they will be included in a future update of the review.</P>
<P>Similarly, a planned subgroup analysis of outcomes for infants who were colonised with fungi at trial entry was not possible. Colonisation, especially heavy gastrointestinal colonisation, has been suggested by some as a risk factor for invasive infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pappu_x002d_Katikaneni-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pappu-Katikaneni 1990</LINK>) but not other (<LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2000</LINK>) observational studies. The subgroup data for only those infants colonised at trial entry were not available in the published reports of the largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kicklighter-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kicklighter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manzoni-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Manzoni 2007a</LINK>). As only about 10% of all of the participating infants were colonised at trial entry, it is unlikely that the analysis of these small numbers would provide clinically useful findings.</P>
<P>It is plausible that limiting the exposure of infants to systemic antifungal prophylaxis by using less intensive dose regimens may help in limiting the emergence of antifungal resistance. Two trials compared 'standard' dosing regimens to less intensive, lower dose regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manzoni-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Manzoni 2007b</LINK>). Neither found statistically significant differences on mortality before hospital discharge or the incidence of invasive fungal infection. However, the 95% confidence intervals were wide and further trials are needed to identify the most appropriate dosing regimen for this intervention.</P>

<P>Systemic antifungal prophylaxis reduces the incidence of invasive fungal infection in VLBW and ELBW infants. The available trial data do not indicate a statistically significant effect on mortality and there are only limited data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Lower dose regimens appear to be as effective at preventing invasive fungal infection as more frequently administered prophylaxis doses, but the 95% CI for these estimates are wide.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-12 17:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of systemic antifungal prophylaxis could provide more precise estimates of the effect on mortality and neuro-disability. Systemic antifungal prophylaxis may be compared with placebo or with topical or oral prophylaxis. Any trial should aim to assess long-term outcomes, particularly disability-free survival, as well as the effect on invasive fungal infection.</P>
<P>Because the burden of invasive fungal infection is confined mainly to the smallest and least mature infants, and because neonatologists who currently use systemic antifungal prophylaxis target infants thought to be at greatest risk, which are mainly ELBW or extremely preterm infants (or infants less than 26 weeks gestation or with birth weight less than 750 grams) with additional risk factors, a trial restricted to this population of infants or perhaps even smaller or lower gestation infants may be appropriate and acceptable (<LINK REF="REF-Burwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burwell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parikh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Parikh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clerihew-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clerihew 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaguelidou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaguelidou 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additionally, although randomised controlled trials may attempt to measure the effect of prophylaxis on antifungal resistance, there is also a need for on-going local and national surveillance to detect the emergence of resistant organisms, particularly if prophylactic use of fluconazole becomes more widespread.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 2001</LINK> reported that 13 of the 50 infants in the placebo group developed invasive fungal infection. Ten episodes were detected during the six-weeks period when the intervention was administered, and three episodes occurred following discontinuation of the intervention. There were no episodes of invasive fungal infection in the fluconazole group during the six-weeks intervention period. One case occurred following discontinuation of the intervention.<BR/>In the report of the outcomes in abstract form (published in Pediatric Research), the investigators state that invasive fungal infection occurred in nine, rather than 10, infants in the placebo group during the six-weeks treatment period, and in two, rather than three, infants in the control group. These differences were related to less information being available at the time that the first (abstract) report was prepared (personal communication Dr Kaufman).</P>

<P>It is unclear as to whether the two infants with bacterial sepsis were withdrawn from analysis from the initial N = 35 (see above) or the N = 33 as the report quotes "2/33...in fluconazole group died because of bacterial sepsis...excluded from the study".
