<P>A pharyngeal pouch is an out-pouching or pocket that develops from the posterior wall of the pharynx just above the entrance to the oesophagus (gullet). Pouches may give rise to difficulty in swallowing, sensation of a lump in the throat or of food sticking in the throat and may lead to troublesome regurgitation of food. Food may enter the pouch rather than passing down the oesophagus and this and regurgitation may result in weight loss, hoarseness of voice and/or recurrent chest infections. The management of patients with a pharyngeal pouch may be either conservative or surgical. Surgical management can be further divided into two broad categories: endoscopic and open procedures. In the first half of the 20th century an open surgical approach to the pouch was most frequently used and remains common in some parts of the world. In recent decades endoscopic procedures (where the approach is made through the mouth) have become popular. The superiority of one approach over another has yet to be clearly demonstrated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-29 10:08:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2005 and previously updated in 2009.</P>
<P>A pharyngeal pouch is an out-pouching or pocket (diverticulum) that develops from the posterior wall of the pharynx just above the entrance to the oesophagus (gullet). The first anatomical description of the diverticulum was presented by Ludlow in 1769 (<LINK REF="REF-Ludlow-1769" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludlow 1769</LINK>) but it was not until 1877 that the basic pathophysiology of the condition was described by Zenker and von Ziemsen (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1877" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1877</LINK>). Respect for this landmark descriptive work resulted in the development of the eponymous term 'Zenker's diverticulum'.</P>
<P>There is little consensus among clinicians as to the exact pathogenesis of the pharyngeal pouch. The modern understanding is that a pouch may develop as the result of a lack of co-ordination in timing and muscle tone within the sphincter muscle at the top of the oesophagus (cricopharyngeus muscle) (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1992</LINK>). During the act of swallowing, the muscles of the pharynx contract and pressure in the pharynx increases. If the cricopharyngeus muscle does not open at the appropriate time, pressure builds up immediately above it and the pharyngeal mucosa may herniate through a potential weakness in the posterior wall of the pharynx at 'Killian's dehiscence', between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus muscles. This results in the development of the pouch (<LINK REF="REF-Killian-1907" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killian 1907</LINK>).</P>
<P>A patient with a symptomatic pharyngeal pouch presents most frequently in the sixth and seventh decade of life. It is extremely unusual in the young (<LINK REF="REF-Gregoire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregoire 1992</LINK>). Symptoms of pharyngeal pouch vary and small pouches may cause no symptoms at all. However, pouches may give rise to difficulty in swallowing, sensation of a lump in the throat or of food sticking in the throat and may eventually lead to troublesome regurgitation of food. Food may enter the pouch rather than passing down the oesophagus and this, in addition to regurgitation, may result in weight loss, hoarseness of voice and/or recurrent chest infections (as a result of aspiration). The diagnosis is usually confirmed radiologically with a barium swallow examination. It is also important to note that there is a real but low risk of carcinoma developing in a pharyngeal pouch, the quoted incidence being of the order of 0.4% to 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Bowdler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowdler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>). Hence long-term follow-up should be considered.</P>
<P>Symptomatic pharyngeal pouches are generally treated by surgery. There are two main types of procedure: open and endoscopic. In an open procedure the pouch is approached through a neck incision. The pouch can be excised (diverticulectomy) (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 1976</LINK>), inverted (inversion or invagination) (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 1993</LINK>) or suspended on the tissues posteriorly so that it will no longer accumulate debris (diverticulopexy) (<LINK REF="REF-Schmit-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmit 1992</LINK>). The spasm induced by the cricopharyngeus muscle can be relieved by a cricopharyngeal myotomy. This procedure may be combined with one of the above procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Gregoire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregoire 1992</LINK>) or may be performed alone (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an endoscopic procedure the approach to the pouch is made through the mouth (transorally). This technique was first described by Mosher in 1917 (<LINK REF="REF-Mosher-1917" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosher 1917</LINK>) and re-popularised by Dohlman in the 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Dohlman-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dohlman 1960</LINK>). The principle objective of the procedure is the division of the separating wall between the pouch and the oesophagus to convert it into one cavity. As the separating wall consists of the cricopharyngeal muscle, a cricopharyngeal myotomy is always carried out during endoscopic division. Various techniques are used to transect the common wall. They include endoscopic stapling (<LINK REF="REF-Collard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collard 1993</LINK>), electrocautery (<LINK REF="REF-van-Overbeek-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Overbeek 1984</LINK>), CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser (<LINK REF="STD-van-Overbeek-1994" TYPE="STUDY">van Overbeek 1994</LINK>), KTP/532 laser (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhn 1992</LINK>) or a needle-knife papillotome (<LINK REF="REF-Ishioka-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishioka 1995</LINK>). Endoscopic procedures have become increasingly popular in the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is considerable worldwide variation in the method of management of pharyngeal pouch. The longer established open procedures remain the treatment of choice in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Busaba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busaba 2001</LINK>) while a recent audit showed that endoscopic stapling has become the most frequent surgical intervention for pharyngeal pouch in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Siddiq-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiq 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the past, open procedures were fraught with complications and associated with high mortality. However, improved surgical techniques and aseptic precautions have reduced the complication rates of diverticulectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Veenker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veenker 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The terms 'pouch excision' and 'open procedure' are often used synonymously. However both diverticulopexy and inversion are open procedures in that the sac is approached through the neck. There is evidence from non-randomised comparative studies that these procedures may be at least as effective as excision of the pouch and they have the perceived benefit that the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus) is not entered during the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Laccourreye-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laccourreye 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Proponents of the various types of endoscopic surgery have reported that the procedures are minimally invasive and associated with shorter operative times, shorter postoperative recovery, quicker resumption of oral intake and, overall, lower complication rates (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK>). However, not all patients can be treated endoscopically. The contraindications for the endoscopic approach may be related to size of the pouch (too small/too large) or the difficulty of surgical access due to anatomical constraints (<LINK REF="REF-Sen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Real doubt remains regarding the optimal method for surgical management of a pharyngeal pouch and clarification is needed on the factors that may influence the choice between an open or endoscopic procedure.</P>

<P>For the original review (2005), we identified and retrieved eight studies which might have fitted our inclusion criteria. Although all eight studies compared one procedure for the management of pharyngeal pouch with another, none were randomised controlled trials. Two of the non-randomised controlled trials compared stapling with diverticulectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaninotto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zaninotto 2003</LINK>) and one compared stapling with all open procedures (<LINK REF="STD-van-Eeden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Eeden 1999</LINK>). CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser was compared to electrocoagulation in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Flikweert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Flikweert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Overbeek-1994" TYPE="STUDY">van Overbeek 1994</LINK>). Two controlled trials compared CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser with open diverticulectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Lippert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lippert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zbaren-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zbaren 1999</LINK>). One study compared diverticulopexy with excision pouch (<LINK REF="STD-Fraczek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fraczek 1998</LINK>) while another compared inversion to excision (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Update searches in 2008 retrieved 70 references but none were studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>The update searches in 2011 initially retrieved 71 references. This number dropped to 52 after removal of duplicates and to four after broad subject and methods sifting. Three references (two studies) did not meet the review inclusion criteria (not randomised controlled trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Rizzetto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzetto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhaegen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Verhaegen 2011</LINK>). One conference abstract appears to report a randomised controlled trial of flexible endoscopic therapy of Zenker's diverticulum. We have attempted to contact the investigators for further information about the study, however we have not as yet had any response (<LINK REF="STD-Charton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Charton 2009</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). We will continue to attempt to obtain more details of this study.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-29 10:15:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of open versus endoscopic approaches in pharyngeal pouch surgery is disconcerting. Furthermore, there are no randomised controlled trials comparing either different open procedures or different endoscopic procedures with each other. A variety of endoscopic techniques are being used around the world yet there is no good evidence as to which method(s) are superior. Properly designed, well-conducted and reported trials comparing different types of approach are now overdue and this review highlights their necessity.</P>
<P>It could be argued that it is difficult to conduct randomised trials comparing open procedures with endoscopic procedures, due to the considerable geographic variation in the management of the condition. Surgeons from different parts of the world have adopted different types of endoscopic technique and a surgeon with expertise in one may not have any experience with another, posing problems for the conduct of randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Endoscopic procedures have become more popular in recent years. The cost-effectiveness and safety of these procedures may offer new advantages over open procedures. Most case series reports of endoscopic procedures show similar rates of success, decreased perioperative time, decreased convalescence, decreased mortality and fewer complications compared to open procedures. However, endoscopic procedures have not achieved universal acceptance. The surgeon's learning curve for these procedures is long. Not all patients can be treated by endoscopic techniques due to surgical access problems or problems related to the pouch. Repeat procedures may be required. Most endoscopic procedures leave patients with a residual pocket and the small risk of developing carcinoma within a pouch that has not been excised remains a contentious issue and has been used as an argument for long-term follow-up or for treating the condition by external excision.</P>
<P>Future trials may indicate the role of a 'tailored approach' in the management of pharyngeal pouch depending on surgical feasibility.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-29 10:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from high-quality randomised controlled trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of endoscopic compared to open procedures for a pharyngeal pouch. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to establish which endoscopic procedure or which open procedure is superior to another.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Clinicians in different parts of the world hold very strong yet different views on the optimal management of a pharyngeal pouch. Open procedures are favoured in some countries. In countries where the endoscopic approach is preferred, a surgeon with expertise in one endoscopic procedure may not be experienced in another. The feasibility of conducting randomised controlled trials evaluating different endoscopic procedures may be questioned. However, when trials are designed, it is essential to achieve standardised outcome measures so that sensible comparisons can be made between trials. Cost-effectiveness and quality of life comparisons should also be included in further research in this field. </P>
