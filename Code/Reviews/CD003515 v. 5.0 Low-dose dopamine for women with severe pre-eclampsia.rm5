<P>No data on the use of low-dose dopamine in women with severe pre-eclampsia who have very low urine output.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a condition in pregnancy involving high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Most women with mild pre-eclampsia give birth without problems. However, severe pre-eclampsia can cause major problems with the functioning of the liver, kidneys and blood clotting. Some women also have very low urine output, which causes further complications. Drugs which help to increase urine output may possibly help with this problem. Low-dose dopamine has been suggested as one such drug, but the review found no trials of low-dose dopamine for women in pregnancy who have severe pre-eclampsia complicated by low urine output. It is suggested that this drug should first be tested in non-pregnant women with very low urine output before it is considered for trials with pregnant women, because of the potential for severe adverse effects if the dose is exceeded.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-03 10:18:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy remain the most important causes of maternal mortality in developed and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HMSO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMSO 1994</LINK>). It has been estimated that as many as 50,000 mothers may die of hypertension in pregnancy annually. Most current classification systems of hypertensive disease in pregnancy are based on the presence of hypertension and proteinuria. In essence, hypertensive pregnant women are classified into three groups, depending on their underlying condition. They may have chronic (usually essential) hypertension, which is often known to have existed prior to pregnancy. Gestational hypertension develops during pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is defined as the development of significant proteinuria in a woman with underlying hypertension during pregnancy. It usually occurs during the second half of pregnancy and complicates 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). The development of pre-eclampsia is associated with poorer maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that affects essentially every organ and system in the body. Hypertension and proteinuria represent only two facets of a complex pathophysiological process characterised by widespread vascular endothelial damage and dysfunction in many systems. In a recent report from a developing country, 131 maternal deaths due to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were analysed (<LINK REF="REF-Pattinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattinson 1998</LINK>). Seventy-five deaths (57%) were associated with eclampsia. The major final cause of death was intracranial haemorrhage, while other causes included liver rupture and associated postpartum haemorrhage. Pulmonary oedema, kidney failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation were noted as contributory causes. Mothers can also survive these problems but remain disabled subsequently. Their long-term outcome will depend largely on whether intracranial haemorrhage or renal failure developed (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>While acute renal failure can be a potentially fatal condition, decreased urine output (oliguria) in women with pre-eclampsia is not necessarily indicative of renal failure and the cause should be determined before any treatment is considered. Oliguria may be a normal response to poor fluid intake, the stress of surgery or lowered blood pressure after antihypertensive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1994</LINK>). It will most commonly be the result of decreased intravascular volume, but in a small number of women, excessive contraction of the renal blood vessels associated with pre-eclampsia may be the cause of oliguria. Acute renal failure requiring dialysis is an extremely rare complication in the industrialised world (incidence 0.01%), but in the developing world as many as 25% of referrals for dialysis are pregnancy related. While not all of these women would have had hypertension or pre-eclampsia, the latter remains the major cause of renal dysfunction in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lindheimer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindheimer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended first-line therapy is a single-fluid challenge (<LINK REF="REF-Dildy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dildy 1994</LINK>), although this approach has not been validated in randomised trials. Either 500 ml crystalloid (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1986</LINK>) or 300 ml colloid solution (<LINK REF="REF-Belfort-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfort 1989</LINK>) has been recommended. However, repeated dosages in the face of persistent oliguria may lead to pulmonary oedema, a serious lung complication with an increased maternal mortality. On the other hand, withholding fluid may cause acute renal problems (tubular necrosis) or even long-term renal damage. </P>
<P>Prolonged oliguria associated with vasospasm may lead to permanent renal damage. Dopamine is widely used in a variety of clinical settings for the prevention and treatment of acute renal failure in non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cuthbertson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuthbertson 1997</LINK>). Its use is based on physiological evidence suggesting that selective renal vasodilation occurs with low-dose infusions. The efficacy of dopamine to prevent complications such as death or prevention of subsequent dialysis has recently been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Chertow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chertow 1996</LINK>). Much emphasis has also been placed on potential side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1994</LINK>). These include arrhythmias and impaired oxygen supply to the heart, gut and peripheral organs. Other possible unfavourable effects include increased urine output in a patient with decreased intravascular blood flow, pulmonary hypertension and other lung problems and decreased motility of the gut. Dopamine can also cause immune dysfunction and reduced secretion of various hormones such as growth hormone, prolactin and dehydroepiandrosterone. The incidence of these possible adverse effects is unknown and will only become available after adequately-sized prospective randomised controlled trials have been done. Until recently, no large randomised controlled trials were available. However, in a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial with 328 non-pregnant participants, the authors concluded that the administration of low-dose dopamine by continuous intravenous infusion to critically ill patients at risk of renal failure did not confer clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2000</LINK>). Arrhythmias were common in this trial in both the dopamine and placebo groups (53/161 versus 54/163).</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to determine whether, in the rare instance of a woman with severe pre-eclampsia who is unresponsive to conventional methods, low-dose dopamine may provide an adjunctive therapy to restore urine output, especially after delivery. However, increased urinary output would only be worthwhile if it was associated with clinically important improvements in the outcome of the woman or her baby, such as improved maternal and perinatal survival, or a decrease in the need for dialysis. </P>

<P>For the children: stillbirth, neonatal death, gestational age at birth, complications related to prematurity (such as use of mechanical ventilation), necrotising enterocolitis and bleeding episodes (such as periventricular haemorrhage), admission to neonatal intensive care unit, length of stay in hospital, as well as long-term outcomes such as neurodevelopmental outcome at follow up. Due to the severity of the maternal disease in women where dopamine treatment is considered, expectant management is unlikely and outcomes such as gestational age at delivery and complications of prematurity reflect the time of onset of disease rather than effects of therapy.<BR/> </P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There are limited data available on the use of low-dose dopamine in women with severe pre-eclampsia. Low-dose dopamine influences renal haemodynamics by vasodilatation through stimulation of dopamine receptors, while higher dosages cause systemic vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 2001</LINK>). There is unfortunately an unpredictable overlap of dose responses, creating the potential for serious adverse effects. The only randomised controlled trial in pregnancy showed a significant improvement in urine output in 20 postpartum pre-eclamptic women with oliguria, compared to 20 women who received placebo. However, the study duration was only six hours and no other data were given on renal function or any long-term effects. The significance of this finding is questionable, as urine output may not be a good substitute marker of renal function. In another study, the use of low-dose dopamine was compared with furosemide in 80 postpartum patients (<LINK REF="STD-Keiseb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keiseb 2002</LINK>). Twenty of the women who had been randomised improved their urine output within four hours and did not require medication. The two regimens were equally effective in improving urine output, while there was no statistically significant difference in women who eventually required haemodialysis. The authors did not include a placebo group in their study. Appropriate data in the non-obstetric literature are also lacking. The use of low-dose dopamine in women with severe pre-eclampsia and acute renal failure, or who are considered to be at risk of acute renal failure, should therefore be restricted to prospective randomised controlled trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are currently few data supporting the use of low-dose dopamine in women with severe pre-eclampsia. Its use should be discouraged due to potentially severe adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>While there may be a place for prospective randomised controlled trials to assess the role of low-dose dopamine in women with oliguria due to renal failure in severe pre-eclampsia, the appropriateness of such a trial should be seriously considered given the lack of evidence of benefit in non-obstetric patients and the potentially serious side-effects. If further trials are conducted, it is important that all clinically appropriate outcomes are reported. </P>
