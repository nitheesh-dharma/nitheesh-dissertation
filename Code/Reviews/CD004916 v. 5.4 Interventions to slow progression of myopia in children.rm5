<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-08 20:22:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nearsightedness (myopia) causes blurry vision when looking at distant objects. Approximately 33% of the population in the United States is nearsighted, and some Asian countries report that up to 80% of children are nearsighted. Several studies have examined a variety of methods (including eye drops, incomplete correction (known as 'undercorrection') of nearsightedness, multifocal lenses and contact lenses) to slow the worsening of nearsightedness.</P>
<P>In this review we included 23 clinical investigations of myopia treatments in children. Two studies investigated undercorrection of myopia; twelve studies investigated multifocal spectacles (progressive addition lenses (PALs) or bifocal spectacles); one study investigated bifocal soft contact lenses (BSCLs); one study investigated novel lenses designed to reduce peripheral hyperopic defocus (peripheral vision farsightedness) (i.e. lenses that help to focus peripheral vision as well as central vision); two studies investigated rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs); and six studies investigated pharmaceutical eye drops (five of these studies were of anti-muscarinic medications). There was one study that evaluated both multifocal lenses and pharmaceutical eye drops. In all studies the interventions of interest were compared with each other, single vision lenses (SVLs) (spectacles), single vision soft contact lenses (SVSCLs) or placebo. The follow-up period was at least one year for all studies.</P>
<P>The largest positive effects for slowing myopia progression were exhibited by anti-muscarinic medications (eye drops), but they either cause light sensitivity or blurred near vision, and are not yet available for use. Multifocal spectacles including PALs and bifocal spectacles were found to yield a small slowing of myopia progression. Undercorrection of myopia was found to increase myopia progression slightly, while RGPCLs were found to have no evidence of effect on myopic eye growth.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-02 01:37:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nearsightedness (myopia) causes blurry vision when looking at distant objects. Highly nearsighted people are at greater risk of several vision-threatening problems such as retinal detachments, choroidal atrophy, cataracts and glaucoma. Interventions that have been explored to slow the progression of myopia include bifocal spectacles, cycloplegic drops, intraocular pressure-lowering drugs, muscarinic receptor antagonists and contact lenses. The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the effectiveness of strategies to control progression of myopia in children.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-11-05 04:38:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of several types of interventions, including eye drops, undercorrection of nearsightedness, multifocal spectacles and contact lenses, on the progression of nearsightedness in myopic children younger than 18 years. We compared the interventions of interest with each other, to single vision lenses (SVLs) (spectacles), placebo or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-10-31 16:09:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1950 to October 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to October 2011), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov).">http://clinicaltrials.gov)</A>. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 11 October 2011. We also searched the reference lists and Science Citation Index for additional, potentially relevant studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-11-05 11:38:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were treated with spectacles, contact lenses or pharmaceutical agents for the purpose of controlling progression of myopia. We excluded trials where participants were older than 18 years at baseline or participants had less than -0.25 diopters (D) spherical equivalent myopia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 06:28:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each included study. When possible, we analyzed data with the inverse variance method using a fixed-effect or random-effects model, depending on the number of studies and amount of heterogeneity detected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 20:15:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 23 studies (4696 total participants) in this review, with 17 of these studies included in quantitative analysis. Since we only included RCTs in the review, the studies were generally at low risk of bias for selection bias. Undercorrection of myopia was found to increase myopia progression slightly in two studies; children who were undercorrected progressed on average 0.15 D (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29 to 0.00) more than the fully corrected SVLs wearers at one year. Rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs) were found to have no evidence of effect on myopic eye growth in two studies (no meta-analysis due to heterogeneity between studies). Progressive addition lenses (PALs), reported in four studies, and bifocal spectacles, reported in four studies, were found to yield a small slowing of myopia progression. For seven studies with quantitative data at one year, children wearing multifocal lenses, either PALs or bifocals, progressed on average 0.16 D (95% CI 0.07 to 0.25) less than children wearing SVLs. The largest positive effects for slowing myopia progression were exhibited by anti-muscarinic medications. At one year, children receiving pirenzepine gel (two studies), cyclopentolate eye drops (one study), or atropine eye drops (two studies) showed significantly less myopic progression compared with children receiving placebo (mean differences (MD) 0.31 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.44), 0.34 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.60), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.90), respectively).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:57:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most likely effective treatment to slow myopia progression thus far is anti-muscarinic topical medication. However, side effects of these medications include light sensitivity and near blur. Also, they are not yet commercially available, so their use is limited and not practical. Further information is required for other methods of myopia control, such as the use of corneal reshaping contact lenses or bifocal soft contact lenses (BSCLs) with a distance center are promising, but currently no published randomized clinical trials exist.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-07 15:15:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a condition where near objects are seen clearly but distant objects appear blurred. In myopia, distant objects are focused in front of the retina instead of on it, as occurs in non-myopic individuals. Myopia occurs because the cornea or lens is too powerful or because the eyeball is longer than normal.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Myopia is an important cause of reduced vision in populations throughout the world and is one of the five immediate priorities for the 'Vision 2020' initiative by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-Pararajasegaram-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pararajasegaram 1998</LINK>). Approximately 2% of the United States population is myopic at school entry (<LINK REF="REF-Blum-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 1959</LINK>) and about 15% of the people entering high schools are myopic (<LINK REF="REF-Sperduto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sperduto 1983</LINK>). Racial and ethnic differences in magnitude and prevalence of myopia have been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maul 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhan 2000</LINK>), both being greater in Asia than other parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Juvenile-onset myopia typically develops at approximately six to eight years of age and progresses at a rate of approximately 0.50 D (diopters) per year through 15 to 16 years (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goss-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goss 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrigin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Perrigin 1990</LINK>). The progression of myopia is typically faster at younger ages (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goss-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goss 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goss 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saw 2000</LINK>), but myopia onset, progression, and stabilization vary widely among individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saw 2000</LINK>). Similar proportions of boys and girls are affected by myopia and the degree of myopia is similar between the two genders (<LINK REF="REF-Zadnik-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zadnik 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Etiology and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Several factors have been suggested to have a role in the development of myopia. Many models estimate greater genetic effects than environmental effects for myopia (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 2001</LINK>). Children with two myopic parents have greater axial lengths which indicates a higher risk of myopia than children with one or no myopic parents (<LINK REF="REF-Zadnik-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zadnik 1994</LINK>). Environmental influences relate to prolonged reading or near work, which has been associated with increased myopia prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Saw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saw 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1969</LINK>). Myopic individuals exhibit a greater accommodative lag (poor focusing accuracy while looking at near objects) than emmetropes (those who do not require spectacles to see either distant or near objects clearly). This high lag of accommodation leads to blur, which may stimulate myopic eye growth (<LINK REF="REF-Gwiazda-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwiazda 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gwiazda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwiazda 1995</LINK>). Fewer hours spent outdoors also has been associated with myopia (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The primary symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision. Children often present to an eye care practitioner after failing a vision screening at school or after a parent or teacher notices the child squinting or having difficulty seeing distant objects.</P>
<P>An eye care practitioner using autorefraction or retinoscopy may confirm the diagnosis of myopia objectively, or it can be confirmed by performing a subjective refraction, which requires responses from the child. In order to diagnose myopia in children, cycloplegic drops can be placed in the child's eyes, hindering his or her ability to focus the eyes so that an accurate prescription can be determined.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-04 09:20:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Spectacles are often the initial treatment for children with myopia because they provide clear vision with few potential side effects. Spectacles for myopia correction use concave lenses that focus light more posteriorly, resulting in a clear image focused on the retina.</P>
<P>Contact lenses are typically a secondary treatment option for children because they require greater dexterity and responsibility to care for them than spectacles. They also bear greater risks than spectacles that range from innocuous redness of the eyes to severe pain and vision loss due to corneal ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Fonn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonn 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacRae-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacRae 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schein 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laser refractive surgery, such as Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) or Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK), causes a permanent flattening of the central corneal curvature by removing stromal tissue with a laser (<LINK REF="REF-Duffey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffey 2003</LINK>). Although it is frequently performed in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Shortt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortt 2006</LINK>), children's eyes are still developing and the myopia continues to change during adolescence, so surgery is not routinely performed in children.</P>
<P>Other forms of myopia correction, such as a lens placed inside the eye and clear rings placed in the cornea, also are not used routinely in children due to children's potential for myopia progression (<LINK REF="REF-Barsam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsam 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-11-07 15:17:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In terms of slowing myopia progression, multifocal spectacles and undercorrection of myopic refractive error are thought to reduce accommodative error, which may act as a stimulus for increased eye growth. Myopic patients exhibit greater accommodative lag than non-myopic patients (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutti 2006</LINK>). Accommodative lag results in light focused behind the retina during near work, which may act as a signal to increase eye growth and result in myopia. If the accommodative error can be reduced with bifocals or undercorrection, then the stimulus for eye growth will be reduced and may slow myopia progression.</P>
<P>Cycloplegic agents were thought to reduce myopic progression by eliminating accommodation, but it has since been shown to be a local retinal effect that slows myopia progression (<LINK REF="REF-Troilo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troilo 1987</LINK>). Anti-muscarinic receptor binding may lead to a biochemical change that slows eye growth, but the exact mechanism is unknown.</P>

<P>Myopia has been reported to reach epidemic proportions in parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2004</LINK>). Strategies to control progression of myopia gain importance in the context of the 'Vision 2020' initiative by the WHO to eliminate preventable causes of blindness, including risks associated with high myopia, by the year 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Pararajasegaram-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pararajasegaram 1998</LINK>). Interventions that have been explored for this purpose include bifocal spectacles, cycloplegic drops, intraocular pressure-lowering drugs, muscarinic receptor antagonists and contact lenses.

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the sources of systematic bias in trials according to the methods described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved disagreements between authors through discussion.</P>
<P>We considered the following parameters:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias (random sequence generation, quality of allocation concealment);</LI>
<LI>performance bias and detection bias (masking of participants, outcome assessors and data analyzers);</LI>
<LI>attrition bias (completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis);</LI>
<LI>reporting bias; and</LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias (such as funding source).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For attrition bias, we considered whether or not reasons for losses to follow-up were comparable between treatment arms and whether or not all participants were analyzed as randomized. If studies reported that an ITT analysis was performed we assessed whether both a) participants in which no outcome was collected, and b) participants who received only some or none of their allotted treatment were included. We interpreted a true ITT analysis to have been undertaken only when both of these criteria were fulfilled.</P>
<P>We classified the risk of bias for each parameter as "low risk of bias", "unclear risk of bias", or "high risk of bias". For example, studies using allocation concealment by centralized randomization and sequential opaque envelopes, (which provided reasonable confidence that the participating eye care providers and patients were not aware of the randomization sequence), were considered to be at low risk of bias. We contacted the authors of trials when additional information was needed to assess risk of bias.

Of those, we included 75 records (23 studies) and excluded 60 records (43 studies); one record was for an ongoing study and two records are awaiting classification. We handsearched the reference lists of included studies and used the Science Citation Index (1 November 2011) to identify additional studies. From the manual search, we identified 38 additional records not identified by the electronic search. Of these 38 records, there were 14 additional records to studies already included, two additional records to studies already excluded, 20 records that were excluded (from 18 studies), one record for a study already awaiting assessment, and one record for an ongoing study.

<P>We included 23 RCTs in this review. The studies evaluated varying interventions, including spectacles, contact lenses and pharmaceutical agents (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The age range of children participating in the included studies was six to 18 years and no child had myopia less than -0.25 D. The primary outcome of all included studies was the progression of myopia, measured as the change in refractive error (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).

In the second study, 106 Malay and Chinese children were evenly randomized to receive spectacles undercorrected by approximately +0.75 D or fully-corrected spectacles (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2002</LINK>). The study periods were 18 months and two years, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Multi-focal versus single vision lenses (spectacles)</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies included in the review compared multi-focal spectacles with single vision lenses (SVLs) (spectacles) for slowing progression of myopia in children. Five of these studies directly compared bifocal spectacles to SVLs for slowing progression of myopia in children. One study, conducted in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, USA, randomized 32 children to receive either bifocals with +1.25 D addition or SVLs (<LINK REF="STD-Fulk-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 1996</LINK>). The children were six to 13 years old and were followed for 18 months. Following this pilot study, the study authors initiated a larger study with slight modifications to the study design (<LINK REF="STD-Fulk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 2002</LINK>). For their second study, the study authors added another study center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, enrolled 82 children aged six to 12 years, changed the addition for the bifocal lenses to +1.50 D, and extended the follow-up period to 30 months.</P>
<P>The third study comparing bifocals to SVLs was the Houston Myopia Control Study (<LINK REF="STD-Houston-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Houston Study</LINK>). The 207 children enrolled in the study (ages six to 15 years) were randomized to one of three treatment groups and followed for three years. The treatment groups included two intervention groups that received bifocals with either +1.00 D or +2.00 D addition, and a standard treatment group that received SVLs.</P>
<P>A study from central Finland enrolled myopic schoolchildren referred by local doctors and nurses after routine vision check-ups (<LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>). In all, 240 children with a mean age of 10.9 years were randomized to one of three treatment groups and followed for three years. The first intervention group, the distant-use group, received minus lenses with full correction and were advised to use them for distance vision only and to read at the greatest distance possible. The second intervention group, the bifocal group, received clear plastic bifocal lenses with +1.75 D addition for continuous use. The third group was the reference group and received minus lenses with full correction for continuous use.</P>
<P>The fifth study investigated the effect of bifocal lenses (+1.50 D) with or without a 3-prism diopters base-in prism in the near segment with single vision distance lenses for slowing the progression of myopia in Chinese Canadian children (aged eight to 13 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>). One hundred and fifty children were enrolled in the two-year study.</P>
<P>Four included studies directly compared the use of progressive addition lenses (PALs) to SVLs. The Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET) was a three year, multi-center trial conducted in four major US cities (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK>). In all, 469 children aged six to 11 years were randomized to receive either multifocal lenses (no-line bifocals) with gradual and progressive changes of power or SVLs with the same focal power throughout the lens area. Studies of 298 children from seven to 10.5 years of age and 178 children from seven to 13 years of age were completed in Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>) and China (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>), respectively. The children in both studies, randomized to receive PALs or SVLs, were followed up for two years. A Japanese cross-over trial followed up children aged six to 12 years for 18 months after randomization to PALS or SVLs (<LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>). After 18 months, each child was switched to receive the alternate type of lens and followed up for another 18 months.</P>
<P>The Myopia Intervention Trial (MIT) included 227 Taiwanese children and investigated SVLs, PALs, and PALs in combination with atropine drops for controlling the progression of myopia (<LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK>). The children, between six to 13 years of age, were randomized to one of three treatment groups and followed up for 18 months: 1) SVLs and eyedrop placebo; 2) PALs and eyedrop placebo; and 3) PALs and 0.5% atropine instilled once a day at bedtime.</P>
<P>A three-arm trial including interventions of bifocals, timolol maleate and SVLs was completed in Odense, Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>). For two years, 159 schoolchildren with a mean age of 10.9 years were followed up after being randomized to one of three treatment groups. The bifocal group received bifocal lenses with +2.0 D addition for constant wear. The timolol group received one drop of 0.25% timolol maleate (an IOP reducing beta-blocker) in each eye twice daily in addition to SVLs for constant wear. The control group received only SVLs for constant wear.</P>
<P>In a study of 26 twin pairs, the combined use of bifocal lenses and tropicamide ophthalmic solution for controlling myopia progression was compared to the use of SVLs over a three and a half year period (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1981</LINK>). This Washington D.C. area study included monozygotic twin pairs between the ages of seven and 14 with similar myopia. For each twin pair, one twin was randomized to receive combined treatment of bifocal spectacles with +1.25 D addition and two drops of 1% tropicamide ophthalmic solution (a short-acting cycloplegic) instilled into each eye nightly; the other twin received standard spectacle correction.</P>
<P>A study of 78 children from eight to 18 years of age compared bifocal soft contact lenses (BSCLs) to SVSCLs for controlling myopia progression (<LINK REF="STD-Aller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aller 2006</LINK>).

The novel lenses corrected for central vision as SVLs do, as well as peripheral vision using novel lens designs that had (1) a symmetrical, clear central aperture (20 mm) with increasing peripheral power to +1 D; (2) a symmetrical, clear central aperture (14 mm) with increasing peripheral power to +2 D; or (3) an asymmetrical, clear central aperture with increasing peripheral power to +1.9 D. The study was planned for two years of follow-up, but was terminated at year one due to observing lower than expected progression in myopia among all study participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rigid gas permeable contact lenses versus single vision lenses</HEADING>
<P>Two studies included in the review compared rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs) to either SVSCLs or spectacles (SVLs). The Contact Lens and Myopia Progression (CLAMP) study was a three year trial to compare RGPCLs to SVSCLs for controlling myopia in school-aged children (<LINK REF="STD-CLAMP-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CLAMP Study</LINK>). All the participants had to complete a run-in period successfully prior to enrolment to exclude those that could not adapt to rigid contact lenses. After the run-in period, 116 children aged eight to 12 were randomized to RGPCL or SVSCL treatment groups. A study of 564 children in Singapore, aged six to 12 years, compared the use of RGPCLs to SVL spectacles for controlling myopia over a two-year period (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>). After a three-month adaptation period, 383 participants remained in the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmaceutical agents versus control</HEADING>
<P>The use of topical ophthalmic solutions for the control of myopia progression was investigated in six studies. The Myopia Intervention Trial mentioned previously evaluated SVLs, PALs, and PALs in combination with atropine drops for controlling the progression of myopia (<LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK>). The Atropine in the Treatment of Myopia (ATOM) Study enrolled 400 Singaporean children aged six to 12 years (<LINK REF="STD-ATOM-study" TYPE="STUDY">ATOM study</LINK>). Once each child was randomized to a treatment group, one eye of each child was randomized to receive treatment and the other eye served as a natural control. The atropine group applied one drop of 1% atropine sulfate nightly to the appropriate eye and the placebo group applied one drop of vehicle nightly to the appropriate eye. Follow-up for this study was two years.</P>
<P>Another study, completed in Taiwan, investigated the effectiveness of lower concentrations of atropine for controlling the progression of myopia in children aged six to 13 years (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 1999</LINK>). Two hundred children were randomized to one of three atropine groups or to a control group: 1) daily drop of 0.5% atropine and advised to wear bifocal spectacles; 2) daily drop of 0.25% atropine and advised to wear slightly undercorrected SVLs; 3) daily drop of 0.1% atropine and advised to wear fully corrective SVLs; and 4) daily drop of 0.5% tropicamide. A three-arm trial of 247 children from Taiwan compared the use of topical eye drops for one year in controlling myopia progression (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>). The children aged six to 14 were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 1) 1% atropine drops every other night and bifocal spectacles prescribed after 2 weeks of treatment; 2) 1% cyclopentolate drops every night and SVLs prescribed if necessary; and 3) normal saline eye drops every night and SVLs prescribed if necessary.</P>
<P>Two studies compared the use of pirenzepine gel (an anti-muscarinic) to placebo gel for the control of myopia progression. The first study was a multi-center US study that enrolled 174 children eight to 12 years old, and followed them up for one year (<LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK>). Children were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to apply either 2% pirenzepine ophthalmic gel or placebo gel twice a day. An additional year of follow-up was continued for children who completed the first year.</P>
<P>The final study was a three-arm, multi-center trial from Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>). For one year, 353 children aged six to 13 years were randomly treated with either 1) 2% pirenzepine gel applied twice daily (gel/gel); 2) placebo once daily and 2% pirenzepine gel once daily (placebo/gel); or 3) placebo gel twice daily (placebo/placebo).</P>

Of these studies, we graded 19 to also have adequate allocation concealment. Methods considered to be at low risks of bias for this domain included using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, calling a centralized coordinating center, or allocating the participants to treatment groups after being enrolled in the study. One study which used random number tables did not report whether or not allocation was concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged one study as having inadequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>). Group assignments for this study were determined by selecting pieces of paper with patient numbers written on them from a container. The first 50 numbers pulled out were assigned to the control group, the second 50 to the bifocal group and the remaining 50 to the bifocal plus prism group. Since participants did not have equal chances of being assigned to all treatment groups once the first 50 numbers were drawn, we considered this method of sequence generation to be inadequate. Since treatment assignments were consecutive, there was inadequate allocation concealment as well.</P>
<P>The remaining two studies we considered to have unclear risks of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment were <LINK REF="STD-Aller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aller 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>. These studies stated that patients were randomized, but did not report further details on how randomization was implemented or whether concealment of allocation was done.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Masking (performance bias and detection bias)  </HEADING>
<P>We assessed the use of masking (blinding), for three types of roles: outcome assessors, study participants and data analysts. Furthermore, we considered separately the masking of outcome assessors for primary (change in refractive error) and secondary (changes in axial length and corneal radius of curvature) outcomes. Adequate methods of masking outcome assessors involved having the patients examined by an investigator unaware of treatment assignments. This method was implemented for spectacle or contact lens studies by having the patients remove contact lenses and spectacles prior to being examined or distributing SVLs for all patients to wear during office visits. Use of coded, identical packaging was considered adequate masking for pharmaceutical studies. Overall, masking of primary outcome assessors was done for 17 (74%) of the 23 included studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Of these 17 studies that masked primary outcome assessors, 14 of the studies were masked similarly for the secondary outcome assessors and three of the studies did not measure secondary outcomes related to this review.</P>
<P>We judged five included studies as not masking primary outcome assessors adequately. In a three-armed study comparing bifocal lenses or timolol with SVLs there was only one study investigator, who therefore could not be masked to treatment assignments (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>). Refractive errors for this study were measured by cycloplegic autorefraction. In another three-armed trial comparing bifocals or distance-use spectacles with continuous-use spectacles, it was reported that the examining ophthalmologist did not look at the group assignment before the examination, but often, for different reasons, the group assignments were revealed (<LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>). However, the three-year follow-up examinations were conducted by two different ophthalmologists, one of whom did not know the group assignments. Refractive errors for this study were measured by subjective cycloplegic refraction. The Houston Myopia Control Study included a team of masked observers (evaluation team) and a team of unmasked observers (patient care team) to measure outcomes in a trial of bifocal versus SVLs (<LINK REF="STD-Houston-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Houston Study</LINK>). Since the results presented in the final analysis of the primary outcome were from the non-masked group, we judged the study as having inadequate masking of primary outcome assessors. Refractive errors for this study's results were measured by subjective noncycloplegic refraction. There were two included studies that did not attempt to mask primary outcome assessors, one measured refractive errors by cycloplegic autorefraction (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>) and the other measured refractive error by subjective cycloplegic refraction (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>). With the exception of the Houston study, secondary outcome assessors were the same as the primary outcome assessors. Data for secondary outcomes in the Houston study were collected by the masked evaluation team and, therefore we considered them to have a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>One study did not report masking of outcome assessors and we judged it to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>). This used cycloplegic refraction, but did not specify whether it was autorefraction or subjective refraction.</P>
<P>Due to the interventions under investigation, masking of participants was not feasible for many of the studies included in this review. Participants from 18 (78%) of the 23 included studies could not be masked because of significant physical (e.g. contact lenses versus spectacles), functional (e.g. multifocal lenses versus SVLs), or performance (e.g. undercorrected versus fully-corrected spectacles) differences between the study interventions. The three studies evaluating pharmaceutical agents exclusively did mask participants adequately by distributing identically packaged, coded bottles (<LINK REF="STD-ATOM-study" TYPE="STUDY">ATOM study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>). One study reported masking participants, but we judged it as having an unclear risk of bias because it was not clear whether the two types of contact lenses under study, BSCLs versus SVSCLs, performed differently when used by the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Aller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aller 2006</LINK>). A second study also reported masking participants, but we judged it as having an unclear risk of bias because it was not clear whether the novel lens designs were noticeably different to participants when compared with the control SVLs (<LINK REF="STD-Sankaridurg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sankaridurg 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final assessments for masking applied to the study data analysts. How data were handled and whether or not data analysts were masked to treatment groups was not reported in 10 (43%) of the 23 included studies. Two studies explicitly stated that masked investigators analyzed the data independently (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>). Additionally, study authors contacted for clarification replied that data analysts were masked for <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shih-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 1999</LINK>. Although three studies stated that data were analyzed independently after the conclusion of the trial, we considered masking of data analysts to be unclear since the treatment assignments may have been accessible in the data (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>). One study could not be masked because there was only one investigator involved (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>). Study authors of four studies informed us that data analysts were not masked (via email communications) (<LINK REF="STD-CLAMP-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CLAMP Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>). We assessed studies in which data analysts were not masked or masking of data analysts was not reported, to have an unclear risk of bias for this parameter.</P>

<P>Attrition rates reported by the included studies varied from 0% to 61%. There were three studies that followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis as defined by this review: 1) participants were analyzed in the intervention groups to which they were randomized, regardless of the intervention they actually received; and 2) all randomized participants were included in the analysis, even participants in which no outcome was collected. One study had follow-up data for all participants at the final follow-up visit (<LINK REF="STD-CLAMP-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CLAMP Study</LINK>) and two used statistical methods to account for all randomized patients by imputing values for missing data (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 2002</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK> used the last-observation-carried-forward method to impute data for the seven (1.5%) children who did not complete the study. The <LINK REF="STD-Fulk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 2002</LINK> study imputed missing data for seven (8.5%) children that did not complete the study by assuming that they had "myopia progression equal to that of mean progression observed in the SVL group for the time period for which their data were missing."</P>
<P>There were seven studies that analyzed participants in the intervention groups to which they were randomized, but did not include all randomized participants in the analysis due to attrition. In none of the studies were patients excluded from the analysis due to noncompliance, switching intervention groups or failure to adhere to treatment protocols. In four of these studies, outcome data were missing in both intervention groups, but drop-outs were balanced across groups and participants who dropped out were similar to those who remained (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulk-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>). The attrition rate for each of these studies was between 6.5% and 15%. For these considerations we judged these four studies as having a low risk of bias due to minimal amounts of incomplete outcome data. The other three studies had an unclear risk of attrition bias due to unbalanced drop-out rates between treatment groups or because there were statistically significant differences between participants who dropped out compared with those who remained in the study (<LINK REF="STD-ATOM-study" TYPE="STUDY">ATOM study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed one additional study to be at low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>). In this study, one child who was randomized was excluded from the study because he was subsequently found to be ineligible (his sister had been included previously in a different group). Two other children moved from the area (less than 1% of the study population) and were excluded from the analyses due to missing data. The remaining participants were analyzed by their original treatment assignments. One study published only as an abstract reported the number of patients included in the analyses, but it was not clear whether this number represented the total number who were initially enrolled in the study and randomized to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Aller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aller 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged the remaining 11 studies to have a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. The percentage of missing data ranged from 4% to 61%. In all of these studies, a proportion of participants were excluded after randomization for not adhering to treatment protocol, having adverse events or withdrawing consent. In a study evaluating undercorrection with full-correction spectacles, participants were excluded for not wearing spectacles continuously (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 2006</LINK>). A study comparing bifocal lenses with SVLs excluded patients from the analysis who were randomized to receive SVLs, but dropped out because their parents wanted them to receive bifocals (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>). In another study evaluating bifocals and SVLs, noncompliant patients were dismissed from the study as were patients who were fitted with contact lenses without informing study personnel (<LINK REF="STD-Houston-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Houston Study</LINK>). One study excluded two participants for withdrawing due to having an adverse event or withdrawing consent, as well as seven participants who were lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Sankaridurg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sankaridurg 2010</LINK>). The other seven studies evaluated a pharmaceutical agent in at least one treatment arm (seven of the eight pharmaceutical studies included in this review). In five of these studies, participants were excluded for not using the eye drops or gel, or for not using them consistently (<LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shih-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>). Another study evaluating timolol plus SVLs versus bifocals or SVLs, excluded patients for switching to contact lenses or because they could not adapt to the bifocal lenses (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>). In the last study, a co-twin study in which one twin received bifocal spectacles and 1% tropicamide ophthalmic solution and the other twin received SVLs, one twin pair was excluded from the study for noncompliance (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to excluding participants for non-adherence, two studies reported an imbalance in drop-out rates (<LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-PIR_x002d_205-Study" TYPE="STUDY">PIR-205 Study</LINK> reported that there were significantly more drop-outs in the pirenzepine arm compared with the placebo arm, although three additional analytical methods used to impute missing values for those who discontinued the study found similar or more beneficial treatment effects for pirenzepine compared with analysis censoring the drop-outs. The <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK> study also reported more drop-outs in the pirenzepine treated groups than the placebo only group. Although the difference was not statistically different, all the patients who dropped out because of adverse events received pirenzipine.</P>
<P>Two studies excluded participants for inefficacy of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>). In the MIT study, two children were excluded from the study for having myopic progression greater than 2.00 D per year. One child was from the SVL group and one child was from the PAL group (none were from the atropine plus PAL group). One child was dropped from the placebo group of the <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK> study for inadequate efficacy.</P>
<P>Finally, the study with the highest percentage of missing data enrolled 247 children, but data were missing for 151 (61%) children (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>). Reasons for missing data were not reported. The study authors stated that "patients who used the eye drops continuously for one year received another complete ophthalmologic examination" and "96 such patients were collected for evaluation, 32 in each group". It was not clear whether the 96 patients analyzed included all the children who were examined at one year or a subset of those examined.</P>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2011-11-08 09:54:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All the studies included in this review reported outcomes related to the progression of myopia with at least one year of follow-up. Study specific outcomes used to measure progression of myopia included mean changes in refractive error, mean rate changes in refractive errors and mean differences (MDs) in refractive errors. We assessed seventeen (74%) studies to have a low risk of bias for selective reporting: eight studies reported results for study outcomes defined a priori (i.e. in a design and methods publication, baseline report or clinical trial registry); and nine studies reported results for the outcomes described in the methods section of each paper (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study had an unclear risk of bias due to inadequate reporting for one of the two outcomes measured (<LINK REF="STD-Fulk-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 1996</LINK>). For this study, the refractive error outcome was reported by treatment assignment, however, the axial length outcome was presented only as it correlated to myopia progression and results by treatment groups were not given.</P>
<P>We considered five studies to have a high risk of reporting bias. For one study only published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Aller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aller 2006</LINK>), the study author's website stated: "Full disclosure of the results is awaiting approval by the sponsor, but some results have already been published in abstract form" (<LINK REF="REF-Aller-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aller 2010</LINK>). The results published in the abstract did not include all the study outcomes listed in the clinicaltrials.gov registry. Another study stated in its methods section that results would be discussed only if exceptional (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>). There was one study in which not all outcomes described in the methods section were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK>) and one study in which all outcomes identified in the study methods were reported, but the number of participants included in the analyses were not consistent between outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>). In the final study, results were not reported for evaluation team (masked observers) measurements or for other secondary outcomes outlined in the design paper (<LINK REF="STD-Houston-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Houston Study</LINK>). The methods paper stated that an evaluation team report would be based on 1) cycloplegic retinoscopy, 2) non-cycloplegic autorefraction and 3) cycloplegic autorefraction performed by masked examiners. However, findings from masked examinations were not reported in the outcomes paper, and instead results were reported from the patient team (unmasked observers). Also secondary outcomes, such as change in axial length, were not reported.</P>

<P>One study was a cross-over trial and we assessed this as having an unclear risk of bias since carry-over effects were not investigated and some participants who completed the first period dropped out during the second period (<LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>). Thus, we only used data from the first period to estimate treatment effects.</P>
<P>One study reported having imbalances between treatment groups at baseline in gender, corneal curvature and refractive error (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>). This study also had unequal losses to follow-up between treatment groups and by gender. In addition to these considerations and due to the 32% of participants who dropped out of the study between randomization and the end of the adaptation period, we judged this study to have a high risk of bias. Two other studies incorporated a pre-randomization administration of an intervention in their study designs (<LINK REF="STD-ATOM-study" TYPE="STUDY">ATOM study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLAMP-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CLAMP Study</LINK>).

<P>There were two additional studies with unclear risk of bias for other sources.

In the Houston Study, outcomes were assessed by masked and unmasked personnel. Although the study protocol described presenting primary outcome data collected by the masked investigators, results were only published for data measured by unmasked subjective refraction without cycloplegic and sometimes measured by student examiners. In the <LINK REF="STD-Shih-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 1999</LINK> study, participants in different treatment groups were advised to wear differing types of spectacle lenses depending on the concentration of atropine received. The rationale for recommending different types of spectacles for different atropine doses (bifocals in the 0.5% group; undercorrected lenses in the 0.25% group; and fully corrective lenses in the 0.1% group) was not explained. In the <LINK REF="STD-Yen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1989</LINK> study it was unknown why equal numbers of participants dropped out of each group or how the equal numbers of participants per group were selected for analysis ("96 such patients were collected for evaluation, 32 in each group").</P>

<P>We compared several interventions to SVL (spectacles) or SCLs in order to determine which treatments may best slow the progression of myopia in children. We pooled results for prespecified outcomes when appropriate; otherwise we reported study-specific results. For the primary outcome of this review, progression of myopia assessed as the mean change in refractive error (spherical equivalent) from baseline for each year of follow-up, negative mean differences (MDs) represented faster progression of myopia in the treatment group compared with progression in the control group. Thus, point estimates to the left of null on the forest plots favor the control group for this outcome. For axial length, negative MDs represent less axial elongation for treatment group participants compared with control group participants (point estimates to the left of null on the forest plots favor the treatment group for this outcome).

<P>At one year follow-up, the average progression was 0.16 D slower (95% CI 0.07 to 0.25) for 633 multifocal (+1.50 to +2.00 near addition) spectacle wearers than for 633 SVL wearers in seven studies (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The effect, from a meta-analysis of only three to four trials in each comparison, was similar among PALs wearers (MD 0.17 D, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.24) and bifocal lens wearers (MD 0.16 D, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32). One study with quantitative data did not report data at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>). Excluding from the analysis the two studies with MDs based on final values did not influence the result significantly (MD 0.16 D, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.26). Excluding <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>, which used subjective refraction, from the analysis did not influence the result significantly (MD 0.19 D, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.27). Excluding <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>, which was not randomized adequately, from the analysis did not influence the overall result significantly (MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.19); however, when excluding <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK> from the analysis, the I<SUP>2 </SUP>for the bifocal subgroup was reduced from74% to 0%.</P>
<P>Seven of the eight studies with quantitative data followed up participants for at least two years, of which four evaluated bifocal lenses and three evaluated PALs (Figure 5). Due to the amount of statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%), we did not include these studies in a meta-analysis. Qualitatively, at two years, four studies favored multifocal lenses over SVLs (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>); a further two studies favored multifocal lenses over SVLs, although the effect was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1991</LINK>); and one study favored SVLs over multifocal lenses, although the effect was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK>).</P>

We did not combine these studies in a meta-analysis due to statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 81.9%). The <LINK REF="STD-COMET-Study" TYPE="STUDY">COMET Study</LINK> reported a significant MD of 0.19 D (95% CI 0.04 to 0.34) for PAL wearers compared with SVL wearers. <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e4_rssinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pärssinen 1989</LINK> reported a non-significant MD in the opposite direction for bifocal wearers compared with SVL wearers (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.09).</P>
<P>Three studies not included in the meta-analyses showed mixed effects of multifocal lenses for slowing myopia progression. In a cross-over study of +1.50 PALs versus SVLs, children wearing PALs during the first 18-month treatment period showed significantly less progression than children wearing SVLs (MD 0.31 D, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.51); however, no difference was observed between groups for the second 18-month period (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.21) (<LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>). In an 18-month study of 14 children assigned to wear +1.25 bifocal lenses and 14 children assigned to wear SVLs, bifocal wearers progressed -0.39 D/year and SVL wearers progressed -0.57 D/year (P = 0.26) (<LINK REF="STD-Fulk-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fulk 1996</LINK>). The authors noted that during the first year of the study the rate of progression was equal between groups, but during the last six months of the study the SVL group progressed more rapidly than the bifocal group. In a three-arm trial of +1.00 bifocals, +2.00 bifocals, and SVLs, no significant differences were observed between groups after three years of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Houston-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Houston Study</LINK>). The reported average change in refraction error per year during the three-year study for +1.00 bifocals was -0.36 D/year (n = 41), +2.00 bifocals was -0.32 D/year (n = 44) and SVLs was -0.34 D/year (n = 39).</P>

<P>The three studies that did not report one year data showed treatment effects in the same direction as the studies included in the meta-analysis, although results were not significant in two studies. In a three-arm trial of PALs with or without atropine compared with SVLs, a pair-wise comparison showed participants who wore PALs without atropine had on average 0.10 mm (95% CI 0.00 to 0.20) less axial elongation compared with participants who wore SVLs at 18-months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-MIT-study" TYPE="STUDY">MIT study</LINK>). In the cross-over trial by <LINK REF="STD-Hasebe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hasebe 2008</LINK>, axial length was not measured at baseline; however, there was no significant difference in axial length between groups after the first 18-month study period (MD -0.08 mm, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.25) and no significant change in axial length was reported between groups after the second 18-month study period (MD -0.01 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.07).

<P>One study compared three doses of atropine with tropicamide (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 1999</LINK>). In the four-arm trial participants were assigned to receive 0.5% atropine drops plus bifocals, 0.25% atropine drops plus slightly undercorrected lenses, 0.1% atropine drops plus fully corrected SVLs, or 0.5% tropicamide drops (control group). At one year follow-up, myopia progression was significantly slowed for each atropine group compared with the tropicamide group, with the highest atropine dose showing the least progression (MD 0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.07 for 0.1% atropine; MD 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.05 for 0.25% atropine; and MD 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28 for 0.5% atropine). This effect was also observed at two years follow-up for each atropine group compared with the tropicamide group (MD 1.95, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.30 for 0.1% atropine; MD 1.98, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.28 for 0.25% atropine; and MD 2.42, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.68 for 0.5% atropine).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:21:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings suggest that there is limited evidence favoring full correction of myopia compared with undercorrection. Trials have shown a clinically insignificant benefit with progressive addition lenses (PALs) compared with single vision lenses (SVLs). The effects for axial length and corneal curvature did not support this small beneficial effect for refractive error comparing PALs with SVLs. Evidence supporting the benefit of bifocal lenses compared with SVLs is limited and inconsistent across heterogeneous trials.</P>
<P>A single study, at high risk of bias, provided evidence of slower progression of refractive error when using bifocal soft contact lenses (BSCLs) compared with single vision soft contact lenses (SVSCLs). The evidence from this single trial should not be considered conclusive. The evidence regarding the beneficial effect of rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs) is conflicting and may be related to the ethnicity of participants and/or the comparator intervention in the included trials. For example, Asian children are more likely to be myopic and their myopia progresses faster than Caucasian children (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhan 2000</LINK>), so any myopia control agent may be more or less effective for Asian children than Caucasian children because the cause of their myopia may be different. A statistically significant effect of 0.63 D (95% CI 0.30 to 0.96) favoring RGPCLs was observed in a trial conducted among children comprised predominantly of Caucasian ethnicity. The comparator was soft contact lenses (SCLs). In a trial of children with Chinese ethnicity, compared with SVLs, we observed a very small, statistically non-significant beneficial effect.</P>
<P>We found consistent evidence favoring anti-muscarinic drugs compared with placebo for reducing the progression of myopia and elongation of the axial length in children with myopia. Atropine resulted in an effect with larger magnitude than pirenzepine or cyclopentolate. There was no trial directly comparing the three different anti-muscarinic drugs. These drugs also were associated with frequent side effects, such as sensitivity to light and blur while reading, which may lead to approximately 15% of children quitting the therapy (<LINK REF="STD-ATOM-study" TYPE="STUDY">ATOM study</LINK>). One study directly compared atropine versus tropicamide, although the concentration of atropine (0.1% and 0.25%) was much lower than that used in other trials, and found a statistically significant beneficial effect with atropine.</P>
<P>Evidence from one trial each suggests that using atropine in addition to either bifocal (at 1% concentration) or PALs (at 0.05% concentration) resulted in slower progression of myopia and lesser elongation of axial length compared with SVLs without the use of atropine.</P>
<P>In summary, we found consistent evidence of a meaningful benefit with using anti-muscarinic drugs for slowing progression of myopia in children. Neither the optimal dose of anti-muscarinic drugs nor the additional value of using anti-muscarinic drugs along with spectacles or contact lenses has been adequately answered by available evidence. The evidence regarding beneficial effects of the other interventions included in this review is neither consistent nor confirmatory.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-03 04:18:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several interventions have been investigated by more than one reporting source (journal publication, conference abstract, trial registry, etc.) and they provided sufficient evidence to determine the applicability of the treatment for slowing myopia progression. However, reporting of results was inconsistent among studies, so grouping of findings was difficult. Anti-muscarinic pharmaceutical agents hold the most promise for slowing myopia progression in children, but most investigations reported in the literature lacked complete data to include in the analysis.</P>
<P>The included trials have been conducted across populations of diverse ethnic and geographic locations. The effects that we observed for anti-muscarinic drugs was consistent across studies conducted in Caucasian populations as well as Asian populations.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-05 12:02:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was limited to RCTs, eliminating the chance of treatment selection bias based on participants' desires for a specific correction. However, not all biases were completely eliminated. For example, participants could not be masked with regard to treatment when they were assigned randomly to spectacles versus contact lenses or to one of two types of contact lenses. Although it is unlikely the participants could influence the outcome of myopic eye growth, they may have been more likely to end participation in a study if they received a treatment that did not interest them, which could potentially increase the risk of bias.</P>
<P>The primary outcome for myopia progression studies typically has been change in refractive error over time; however, as new methods of assessing myopia have become available, the primary outcome has switched to axial growth of the eye. During this transition, both methods have been measured and reported, which may add confusion if the two methods provide differing information. For example, the RGPCL trial by Walline and colleagues found that RGPCLs significantly slowed myopia progression, but they did not slow axial eye growth (<LINK REF="STD-CLAMP-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CLAMP Study</LINK>). The change in the primary outcome of myopia control studies therefore could lead to a reporting bias, depending on how the study authors reported the data.</P>
<P>Although most studies used masked examiners to measure primary outcomes, several trials lacked masked examiners or did not report masking in the study, so the risk of examiner bias still exists. The vast majority of studies either did not mask the person analyzing the study data or they did not report whether or not the data were masked. It is important for statisticians to make decisions based solely on available data that should not include treatment allocation in order to reduce or eliminate the potential for reporting bias.</P>
<P>Overall, with the improvement of trials following the CONSORT Statement for RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>), the potential for bias has been largely addressed, but many studies still lack the required rigor of reporting that is necessary to allow the reader to assess the risk of bias in individual trials.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-11-05 11:43:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reduced the risk of bias during the review process by utilizing a thorough literature search and by not limiting studies that were reviewed based on language or dates. Two review authors, including at least one clinician (JJW, DOM, SAC, JDT) and one methodologist (SSV, KL), independently assessed the search results for eligibility and extracted data. There is little reason to believe that investigations would have been missed by the search methods unless the results of the study were never reported.</P>

The conclusions in these three reviews are consistent with our observations in this systematic review. Other treatments, such as undercorrection of myopia, multifocal spectacles and RGPCLs do not slow the growth of the eye in a clinically meaningful manner (slowing the growth of the eye by 50% or more).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-05 04:12:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on available evidence, the most effective method of slowing myopia progression is with anti-muscarinic topical medications, but the side effects and limited availability make them a little-used option for myopia control. Further investigations of myopia control must be conducted in order to find a treatment that is clinically meaningful and beneficial and with few adverse effects. The leading potential candidates at this time are corneal reshaping and BSCLs, but much more evidence must be presented in order to determine their abilities to slow myopia progression.</P>
<P>None of the interventions studied have slowed myopia progression in a clinically meaningful manner, with the exception of anti-muscarinic pharmaceutical agents. However, anti-muscarinic pharmaceutical agents either have significant side effects, such as mydriasis and cycloplegia, or they are not commercially available at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-08 07:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until recently, there have been few RCTs conducted to investigate myopia control. The reporting of results from RCTs was extremely variable. Investigators must compare results to previous investigations and report findings according to the CONSORT statement in order to maximize the potential for combining results of a variety of studies. Future investigators should consider findings from this systematic review in determining the comparisons that should be examined and the patient populations to be studied. We have not found conclusive evidence of the effects of most interventions included in this review, despite our consistent findings for the effects of anti-muscarinic drugs. For example, there is limited evidence on an optimal dose of anti-muscarinic drugs for use in children. The evidence that we examined was limited in several ways including the potential for bias. Future trials should be designed and reported considering the potential for application of novel analytical methods such as multiple treatment meta-analyses. The added value of using anti-muscarinic drugs along with spectacles or contact lenses and the effects of other combinations of interventions in slowing the progression of myopia in children need to be clarified. If future investigators find a clinically and statistically significant treatment effect, they should determine whether the effect continues to be sustained after the treatment is discontinued and attempt to determine the true mechanism of the treatment effect.</P>
