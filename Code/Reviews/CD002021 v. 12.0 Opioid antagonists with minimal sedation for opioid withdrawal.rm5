<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:18:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on the effects of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, naloxone) plus minimal sedation for managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (for example, heroin or pharmaceutical opiates).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for longer-term treatments of opioid dependence. The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completing withdrawal difficult for most people. The rationale underlying the use of opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal is that a faster transition from dependence to abstinence might make completing withdrawal easier. This review considered the effects of treatment with opioid antagonists versus other approaches for withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to December 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 10 studies, including six randomised controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and four prospective cohort studies (where participants could choose which treatment they received) involving 955 opioid-dependent participants. Four of the studies took place in the UK, three in the USA, two in Italy and one in Australia. Nine of the 10 studies compared treatment with an opioid antagonist (naltrexone or naloxone) plus an adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine) versus a regimen based on clonidine or lofexidine alone. Other comparisons (placebo, reducing doses of methadone, buprenorphine) made by included studies were too diverse for any meaningful analysis.</P>
<P>Four studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We are uncertain whether peak withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists plus clonidine or lofexidine is more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, or whether the average severity over the withdrawal period is less, as the certainty of the evidence is very low.</P>
<P>Clinicians should warn people of the possibility of delirium in the first day of administration of naltrexone, particularly with higher doses (&gt; 25 mg). People should also know that withdrawal will be moderately severe and that symptoms such as muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhoea, and insomnia are likely to persist despite medication.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The studies included in this review were diverse and generally of very low quality. As a result there is considerable uncertainty about the value of approaches using opioid antagonists to induce opioid withdrawal as a means of managing withdrawal from opioid dependence.</P>

<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials along with prospective controlled cohort studies comparing opioid antagonists plus minimal sedation versus other approaches or different opioid antagonist regimens for withdrawal in opioid-dependent participants.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:15:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten studies (6 randomised controlled trials and 4 prospective cohort studies, involving 955 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. We considered 7 of the 10 studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the domains we assessed.</P>
<P>Nine studies compared an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus a treatment regimen based primarily on an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine). Other comparisons (placebo, tapered doses of methadone, buprenorphine) made by included studies were too diverse for any meaningful analysis. This review therefore focuses on the nine studies comparing an opioid antagonist (naltrexone or naloxone) plus clonidine or lofexidine versus treatment primarily based on clonidine or lofexidine.</P>
<P>Five studies took place in an inpatient setting, two studies were in outpatients with day care, two used day care only for the first day of opioid antagonist administration, and one study described the setting as outpatient without indicating the level of care provided.</P>
<P>The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of opioid antagonist treatment regimen, the comparator, the outcome measures assessed, and the means of assessing outcomes. As a result, the validity of any estimates of overall effect is doubtful, therefore we did not calculate pooled results for any of the analyses.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for treatment with an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist is very low. Two studies reported data on peak withdrawal severity, and four studies reported data on the average severity over the period of withdrawal. Peak withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists in combination with an adrenergic agonist appears to be more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, but the average severity over the withdrawal period is less. In some situations antagonist-induced withdrawal may be associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion compared to withdrawal managed with adrenergic agonists. However, this result was not consistent across studies, and the extent of any benefit is highly uncertain.</P>
<P>We could not extract any data on the occurrence of adverse events, but two studies reported delirium or confusion following the first dose of naltrexone. Delirium may be more likely with higher initial doses and with naltrexone rather than naloxone (which has a shorter half-life), but we could not confirm this from the available evidence.</P>
<P>Insufficient data were available to make any conclusions on the best duration of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:15:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using opioid antagonists plus alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists is a feasible approach for managing opioid withdrawal. However, it is unclear whether this approach reduces the duration of withdrawal or facilitates transfer to naltrexone treatment to a greater extent than withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist.</P>
<P>A high level of monitoring and support is desirable for several hours following administration of opioid antagonists because of the possibility of vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium.</P>
<P>Using opioid antagonists to induce and accelerate opioid withdrawal is not currently an active area of research or clinical practice, and the research community should give greater priority to investigating approaches, such as those based on buprenorphine, that facilitate the transition to sustained-release preparations of naltrexone.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:21:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs is a major health and social issue in most societies. While only around 0.2% of adults report unsanctioned use of opioid drugs globally (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>), these substances contribute more to the burden of disease than other illicit psychoactive drugs. The burden to the individual user and the community of opioid dependence arises from premature mortality and disability associated with dependent use (with the greatest impact in younger drug users; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>), transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, healthcare costs, crime and law enforcement costs,and the less tangible costs of family disruption and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Mark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mark 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment is central to reducing the harms incurred by individuals and the community from opioid dependence. Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, by itself is not an effective treatment for dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Rates of withdrawal completion tend to be low, whereas rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Broers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaillant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaillant 1988</LINK>). However, withdrawal remains a required first step for many forms of longer-term treatment such as residential rehabilitation and naltrexone maintenance (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). It may also represent the endpoint of an extensive period of substitution treatment such as methadone maintenance. As such, managed withdrawal is an essential part of an effective and comprehensive treatment system.</P>
<P>The signs and symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome include irritability, anxiety, apprehension, muscular and abdominal pains, chills, nausea, diarrhoea, yawning, lacrimation, sweating, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, general weakness, and insomnia. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal usually begin two to three half-lives after the last opioid use, that is, 6 to 12 hours after taking short half-life opioids such as heroin and morphine, and 36 to 48 hours after taking long half-life opioids such as methadone. Following cessation of a short half-life opioid, symptoms reach peak intensity within two to four days, with most of the obvious physical withdrawal signs no longer observable after 7 to 14 days. As with onset of withdrawal, its duration also varies with the half-life of the opioid used and the history of regular use (<LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>). Opioid withdrawal is rarely life-threatening or associated with significant aberrations of mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>), but the combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completing withdrawal difficult for most people (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:21:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For many years routine procedures involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). This approach derived from observations that the withdrawal syndrome from methadone was milder, though longer, than from morphine. Methadone's high oral bioavailability, efficacy and long duration of withdrawal relief (24 to 36 hours) were additional factors that contributed to the widespread use of methadone in specialist withdrawal programmes.</P>
<P>Ambivalence to using a drug of dependence to treat opioid dependence, government restrictions on prescriptions, and consumer dislike of the protracted nature of methadone withdrawal have all limited, to some extent, the use of methadone for managing opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>). The alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist clonidine has been widely used as a non-opioid alternative for managing opioid withdrawal because of its capacity to ameliorate some signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1988</LINK>), but it is associated with adverse effects of sedation and hypotension. Disatisfaction with methadone and clonidine have driven research into a variety of alternative approaches. This review focuses on approaches that involve administering opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal, in combination with medication to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms with minimal sedation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-02 06:23:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale underlying the use of opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal is that a faster transition from dependence to abstinence might increase rates of withdrawal completion. Initial experiments with opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal date back to the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>). While initial studies showed that the objective signs of withdrawal reduce rapidly with successive injections of naloxone (the only opioid antagonist available at that time), there was little further interest in the approach until clonidine became available. It seems likely that the use of antagonists alone was limited by poor acceptability to opioid users. Experience with the capacity of clonidine to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal led to studies investigating clonidine (and subsequently other alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists as well as other medications) plus opioid antagonists for managing opioid withdrawal.</P>
<P>Rapid detoxification techniques have seen further development with the administration of opioid antagonists in conjunction with sedation or anaesthesia to suppress people's awareness of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1997</LINK>). This approach of anaesthetic-assisted accelerated withdrawal is the subject of a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a complex range of variables that can potentially influence the course and subjective severity of withdrawal, including the type of opioid used, dose taken, concomitant use of other drugs including alcohol, duration of use, general physical health, and psychological factors, such as the reasons for undertaking withdrawal and fear of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1985</LINK>). Outcomes of a withdrawal episode may also be influenced by a prior period of substitution treatment, since such treatment is likely to result in a degree of stabilisation in health and social functioning that may facilitate successful withdrawal. Where information is available, we consider the influence of these variables.</P>
<P>The first, or acute, phase of withdrawal is followed by a period of six months or so of a secondary or protracted withdrawal syndrome. This protracted syndrome is characterised by a general feeling of reduced well-being that is reflected in measurable abnormal physiological functioning. During this phase, people may experience strong periodic cravings for opioids. The malaise associated with protracted abstinence is thought to be a major factor in relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Satel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satel 1993</LINK>). The protracted nature of withdrawal typically lengthens the recovery period, in which a range of factors &#8211; both social- and treatment-related &#8211; are at play. The types of intervention offered in the acute phase of withdrawal differ substantially from those offered afterwards to promote recovery and prevent relapse. These may include psychological and lifestyle counselling, support groups, and pharmacological and medical treatment. We thus excluded this long-term aspect of treatment of opioid dependence from this review.</P>

<P>Experimental interventions involved administering an opioid antagonist (naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene) in the first three days of treatment or within three days of last opioid use to induce opioid withdrawal, in combination with medication to ameliorate the symptoms but with no or minimal sedation.</P>
<P>We excluded studies of interventions involving opioid antagonists under heavy sedation or anaesthesia. A separate Cochrane Review covers this approach (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sedation differs from anaesthesia in that it is still possible to rouse the patient. In addition, the pharmacological agent used to induce sedation is usually different from anaesthetising agents. The studies included in this review involved either no sedation or light sedation as an adjunct to treatment to aid sleep or reduce anxiety.</P>
<P>Comparators involved tapered doses of methadone, an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, buprenorphine, symptomatic medications or placebo to manage withdrawal, or antagonist-based regimens differing in the type or dose regimen of opioid antagonist. For the purpose of this review, we define symptomatic medications as benzodiazepines, anti-emetics, anti-diarrhoeals, anti-psychotics, anti-spasmodics, muscle relaxants or non-opioid analgesics, administered in combination as needed, or according to a defined regimen.</P>

<P>The rationale for antagonist-induced withdrawal is that a faster transition from dependence to abstinence might increase rates of withdrawal completion. Hence we considered duration of treatment, in addition to rates of treatment completion to assess the extent to which the withdrawal process was shortened by the use of opioid antagonists.</P>
<P>It is difficult to differentiate treatment side effects from the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. We have defined adverse effects as clinically significant signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (such as vomiting and diarrhoea) plus any incidents that are not typical components of the opioid withdrawal syndrome (delirium, hypotension, dry mouth).</P>

<P>We evaluated seven specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and providers, blinding of outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues). For each study we analysed the seven domains as reported in the study and provided a final judgement on the likelihood of bias in terms of low, high or unclear risk. We based these judgements on the criteria indicated in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> and their applicability to the addiction field. We also incorporated criteria drawn from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2010</LINK>). We operationalised the 'Risk of bias' tables for assessing RCTs, CCTs and prospective observational studies using this approach.</P>
<P>We considered blinding for subjective and objective outcomes separately. Lack of blinding is a source of serious risk of bias for subjective outcomes but is less significant with objective outcomes such as treatment completion and duration. We only considered incomplete outcome data for intensity of withdrawal and the nature and incidence of adverse effects. Retention in treatment (duration of treatment) and completion of treatment are frequently primary outcome measures in addiction research.

<P>We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome using the GRADE system. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) developed a system for grading the quality of evidence that takes into account issues related to both internal and external validity, such as directness, consistency, imprecision of results and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The 'Summary of findings' table presents the main findings in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, they provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes.</P>
<P>The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grades of evidence.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2000 under the title 'Opioid antagonists and adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal'. We substantially updated the review in 2009 to incorporate a modified search strategy and changed the title to the current version.</P>
<P>In the present update, we again modified the search strategy, adding the Web of Science to the databases searched. We also removed the term 'Metabolic Detoxication, Drug' from the MEDLINE and CENTRAL searches as this term now maps to 'metabolic inactivation', which is not relevant to this review. We have also amended the review to meet current Cochrane requirements and included a flow diagram of the search process (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>As indicated in the flow diagram (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), we identified 3573 records relevant to the management of opioid withdrawal in general. Of these, we excluded 3269 on the basis of title and abstract. We assessed 304 full-text articles, excluding 244 without listing reasons and 47 records (37 studies) with reasons. Thirteen articles (10 studies) satisfied all the criteria to be included in the review. We had previously considered one of the included studies to be a secondary report of one of the other studies, but this update treats it as a separate, primary study. As a result, this update has 10 included studies, compared to 9 in the 2009 version. We did not identify any new studies relevant to the review published since 2009.</P>

<P>Ten studies (13 reports) involving 955 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).

In <LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2007</LINK>, participants who did not consent to or were excluded from randomisation received methadone.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria compared an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination treatment with a regimen based primarily on either an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, clonidine (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>), or on an analogue of clonidine: lofexidine (<LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies comparing clonidine and lofexidine as the primary medication have reported similar effectiveness in terms of ameliorating signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, lofexidine is associated with fewer hypotensive side effects than clonidine (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2001</LINK> directly compared clonidine and lofexidine as adjunct medications in withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists. Outcomes were similar for the clonidine- and lofexidine-based regimens in terms of craving levels, morphine metabolites in urine and dropout rate. However, participants receiving lofexidine showed lower levels of withdrawal symptoms, fewer mood problems, less sedation and less hypotensive effects. Overall we consider it reasonable to combine clonidine and lofexidine-based regimens in analyses but note the potential for heterogeneity in analyses of withdrawal severity and adverse effects.</P>
<P>Like most included studies, this review focuses primarily on an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus treatment based on an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist for withdrawal.</P>
<P>Four studies compared antagonist-induced withdrawal with treatment regimens other than alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists: in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> the comparator was placebo; in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>, tapered doses of methadone; and in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 1999</LINK>, a regimen based primarily on buprenorphine, although in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> participants in the buprenorphine group were transferred to 25 mg naltrexone plus clonidine on day 4 of treatment.</P>
<P>Because of the small number of studies investigating each of these comparisons, we could draw few conclusions. We did not include these comparisons in analyses, therefore, but we do discuss them where relevant to the review.</P>

Participants also received 0.8 mg naloxone intramuscularly (IM) just prior to the first oral dose of naltrexone (1 mg). Authors reported using this approach in case of a severe withdrawal reaction.</P>
<P>The treatment protocols of three studies called for a maintenance dose of 50 mg/day naltrexone to be reached on day 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>).

<P>Because the naltrexone and naloxone regimens differ substantially, we performed separate analyses for each of these opioid antagonists. We included <LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK> in the naloxone group as this was the antagonist used to induce withdrawal.</P>
<P>Clonidine and lofexidine are usually administered orally. However, Gerra and colleagues used intravenous infusion in their two studies for administering clonidine as an adjunct to antagonist-induced withdrawal. In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> they infused 0.15 mg clonidine three times a day, giving a total dose of 0.45 mg/day as an adjunct to either naloxone- or naltrexone-based withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> administered 0.15 mg clonidine six times a day in 100 mL saline for two days, with an additional oral dose of 0.15 mg in the evening. This equates to 1.05 mg/day for two days. The dose was reduced to 0.15 mg orally three times on day 3 (0.45 mg/day).</P>
<P>Other than <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>, all studies reported the use of a range of additional adjunct medications, including benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (analgesics), anti-emetics and muscle relaxants.</P>

<P>We present results in two sections. The first considers the major comparison between withdrawal induced by an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination and withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist. The second section considers other comparisons. Within each section, we address the four types of outcome measures of interest: intensity of withdrawal syndrome, duration of withdrawal treatment, nature and incidence of adverse effects and completion of treatment and postdetoxification outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus adrenergic agonist</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Severity of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The capacity for and strength of meta-analysis for this outcome was limited by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the small number of studies reporting data on the severity of withdrawal;</LI>
<LI>different approaches to the assessment of the severity of withdrawal; and</LI>
<LI>different ways of presenting the data.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The two studies by O'Connor and colleagues used the same rating instrument comprising 24 items, each graded for severity on a four-point scale (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> used a scale that comprised nine items, primarily objective signs assessed by an observer and graded zero to five for severity. <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK> all used the Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale, which has 10 patient-reported items, each graded zero to three for severity (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK> reported using part 1 of the Severity of Dependence Questionnaire to assess physical withdrawal. This scale usually asks respondents to consider a recent month and to assess the frequency with which they experienced 10 symptoms on waking, before the first dose of opiates. Presumably <LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK> adjusted this scale to record symptoms at the time of assessment.</P>
<P>Studies also varied in the way they reported assessments of withdrawal severity. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> reported total mean (standard deviation (SD)) withdrawal scores at time points of 48 hours and 72 hours after commencement of detoxification. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK> reported the withdrawal score at admission only. However, they reported the amount of oxazepam used by participants in each group during detoxification as an alternative indicator of severity. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> reported the mean (SD) overall withdrawal score and the mean (SD) peak withdrawal score. <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK> both undertook an area-under-the-curve analysis of daily withdrawal scores. <LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reported withdrawal scores only as graphs of mean daily scores and statistical analyses that were not suitable for inclusion in analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK> assessed physical withdrawal immediately prior to and postdetoxification.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> presented graphs of withdrawal scores at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after commencement of treatment, and a table of mean withdrawal score at 48 hours and 72 hours. The 24-hour assessment point was prior to the administration of opioid antagonist. The score at 48 hours was higher than that at 72 hours for all except the placebo group. On this basis we have taken the 48-hour score to represent the peak mean score, making it equivalent to the mean peak withdrawal scores reported in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>. We present data from these studies in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. (Note that we have entered peak withdrawal data from <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> for the group treated with clonidine twice: once for comparison with the naltrexone-clonidine combination, and once for comparison with the naloxone-clonidine combination. As we did not calculate an overall result, there is no double-counting of these participants.)</P>
<P>Similarly, we have taken the data reported in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK> on oxazepam use during detoxification to be an indicator of overall withdrawal severity. While substantially different in nature, the mean overall withdrawal scores from <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> and the area-under-the-curve data from <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK> similarly indicate the overall severity experienced. These data are therefore presented together in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The studies that provide data on peak withdrawal severity provide quite different results (<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> peak withdrawal severity was similar for the two groups [28 (SD 13.1) versus 29.9 (SD 14.9), using a scale with a maximum possible score of 72]. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> peak withdrawal severity is significantly higher in the groups treated with an antagonist [22.88 (SD 11.06) for clonidine-naltrexone and 15.22 (SD 9.49) for clonidine-naloxone compared to 5.44 (SD 1.87) for the group treated with clonidine only, using a scale with a maximum possible score of 45].</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> differ in two aspects: the use of adjunct medications and the method for assessing withdrawal severity. These differences could explain the different results. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> rated withdrawal using a 24-item scale. This scale comprised a mix of signs and symptoms but was predominantly subjective. In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> observers rated each of nine items (pulse rate, tremor, rhinorrhoea, mydriasis, aching muscles, shiver, vomiting, anxiety and insomnia) from zero to five for severity. Graphical presentation of withdrawal at 48 hours (the first day of administration of the opioid antagonist) indicated a significant contribution to the score by pulse rate, an item that was not rated in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> assessed withdrawal severity with the same rating system used in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>. Authors reported mean daily withdrawal scores graphically and in terms of statistical tests, not in a form that enabled data extraction. However, the graphs and statistical tests show no difference in peak withdrawal severity in the group treated with naloxone, naltrexone and clonidine compared to the group treated with clonidine alone. This finding suggests that the rating scale is not sufficient to explain the different results. The treatment regimen used in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> differed from those used in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> in the pattern of administration of naloxone and naltrexone, in the doses of clonidine, and in the use of adjunct medication. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> did not report use of adjunct medications, while in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>, the group treated with naloxone and naltrexone received oxazepam, baclofen and ketoprofen over the two days of initial antagonist treatment. The authors note that this group, as a result, experienced more sedation and suggested that this countered the affective distress and dysphoria of withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK> also used adjunct medications on the first day of antagonist administration, in this case oxazepam, ibuprofen, ketorolac and prochlorperazine. Hence it would seem likely that the differing result reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> compared to <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reflects the use of adjunct medications.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK> report mean daily withdrawal scores to be significantly lower for the group receiving naloxone and lofexidine compared to lofexidine alone, from day 5 (with the first injection of naloxone or placebo occurring on day 3). However, withdrawal was more pronounced in the naloxone-lofexidine group one hour after injection of naloxone on day 3.</P>
<P>The four studies that provide data indicating overall withdrawal severity also produced differing results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Two studies found overall withdrawal severity to be significantly less in the groups treated with an opioid antagonist combined with an adrenergic agonist, compared to those treated primarily with the adrenergic agonist alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK>).

<P>Four studies reported data on treatment completion with naltrexone regimens versus an adrenergic agonist, and six studies with naloxone regimens, with data from <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> included in both subcategories (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). There is significant heterogeneity in these data. Two studies reported significantly higher rates of treatment completion for antagonist-induced withdrawal compared to regimens based on alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists alone (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK>), but in the remaining studies the difference was not significant.</P>
<P>Three of the nine studies providing data on treatment completion were prospective cohort studies and hence are at high risk of allocation bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK>). We consider <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> to be at high risk of allocation bias, while the risk was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>A further point of variability in the studies reporting data on completion of withdrawal was the definition of 'completion'. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK> defined completion by the administration of a 50 mg dose of naltrexone. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> did not define the endpoint, but they reported the number of participants who completed one week of treatment, at which time participants in all treatment groups were scheduled to have achieved a 50 mg dose of naltrexone. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> defined the endpoint as commencement of extended naltrexone treatment, which would also equate to achievement of a 50 mg dose of naltrexone.</P>
<P>The nature of the endpoint used in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> introduces some risk of bias favouring the naloxone-clonidine group. Participants in this group were scheduled to receive 50 mg naltrexone at the end of the second day of treatment, whereas participants in the clonidine group did not commence naltrexone until day 6. However, this schedule reflects the way in which these treatment regimens would be used in a context of routine service delivery, so the comparison is realistic.</P>

However, these studies took place in an inpatient setting with regular urine screening throughout treatment.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reported that 15 of 32 participants (47%) treated with the clonidine-naloxone combination had relapsed to opioid use at six months after detoxification, compared to 18 of 32 (56%) from the clonidine group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Severity of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The small number of studies, the low quality of the evidence, variability in treatment regimen, and variability in the means of assessing and reporting withdrawal severity make it impossible to draw firm conclusions as to the nature and severity of withdrawal induced by an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination compared to withdrawal managed primarily with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist. However, the findings of the studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review suggest that, when combined with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, the severity of antagonist-induced withdrawal is, at worst, similar to withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist, and at best it is less severe. This is probably because of earlier resolution of the signs and symptoms of withdrawal.</P>
<P>Initial administration of an opioid antagonist, particularly naltrexone, may be associated with a peak in withdrawal severity that is greater than the peak that occurs with adrenergic agonist-based regimens. This difference is most marked with the two antagonist-based regimens used in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>. This was the only study not to report the use of other adjunct medication in addition to the adrenergic agonist. The research team subsequently adopted the use of adjunct medication in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> and considered the higher degree of sedation that resulted to be a factor in countering the "affective distress and dysphoria of withdrawal".</P>
<P>The type of opioid used prior to detoxification could potentially influence the nature and severity of withdrawal. The small number of studies involving participants withdrawing from methadone and the variability in treatment regimens and means of assessing withdrawal, prevented any exploration of the effect of the drug of dependence on withdrawal severity based on studies included in this review. However, <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1999</LINK> reports the use of naltrexone with adjunct medication (flunitrazepam, clonidine, octreotide, buscopan, quinine) to induce withdrawal in 15 participants withdrawing from heroin and 15 withdrawing from methadone. On day 7, participants rated the acceptability of the treatment on a 10-point Likert scale where zero was completely acceptable. Of those withdrawing from heroin, 82% (compared to 60% of those withdrawing from methadone) rated acceptability as less than five, indicating the procedure was more acceptable to those withdrawing from heroin compared to those withdrawing from methadone. On the same day, investigators asked participants to rate severity on a 10-point Likert scale where zero is minimally severe. Of those withdrawing from heroin, 27% (compared to 7% of those withdrawing from methadone) rated severity as less than five. Participants withdrawing from methadone experienced more gastrointestinal symptoms than those withdrawing from heroin. These data suggest less severe symptoms in the cohort withdrawing from heroin, compared to those withdrawing from methadone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nature and incidence of adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In addition to vomiting and diarrhoea, some opioid-dependent people may experience a degree of delirium or confusion following administration of an opioid antagonist. Only two of the studies included in this review reported delirium. However, six studies that did not meet the criteria for inclusion in this review reported delirium as an adverse effect of antagonist-induced withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Charney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Golden-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Golden 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1999" TYPE="STUDY">London 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senft-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Senft 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1992</LINK>). Other studies have reported delirium or confusion after accidental ingestion of naltrexone by people who are opioid dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Boyce-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galloway-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galloway 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tornabene-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tornabene 1974</LINK>). In all cases the opioid antagonist administered was naltrexone, and in most cases the initial dose of naltrexone was 25 mg or greater. There are no reports of delirium as an adverse effect of treatment regimens involving low doses of naloxone, suggesting that the risk of delirium may be related to the dose and duration of action of the opioid antagonist. While the risk of delirium is probably reduced by the use of lower doses of naltrexone, it can still occur (<LINK REF="STD-Charney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Charney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1992</LINK>). The use of other drugs in addition to opioids, particularly benzodiazepines, is one possible risk factor (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Golden-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Golden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (dizziness, sedation, dry mouth) are likely to be experienced in the first few days of treatment when high doses of drug are required to ameliorate the withdrawal symptoms induced by the opioid antagonist. However, it appears that hypotension necessitating cessation of adrenergic agonist may be rare when the drug is administered in combination with an opioid antagonist, and even less likely with lofexidine than with clonidine, although <LINK REF="STD-London-1999" TYPE="STUDY">London 1999</LINK> reported that 1 of 20 participants had a late hypotensive reaction to withdrawal induced by naltrexone administered in conjunction with lofexidine and a range of other adjunct medications.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1999</LINK> reported that vomiting was common with antagonist-induced withdrawal, but participants treated with the drug octreotide did not require fluid replacement. <LINK REF="STD-London-1999" TYPE="STUDY">London 1999</LINK>, in their review of 20 cases of antagonist-induced withdrawal, reported that two participants experienced severe vomiting, and five had severe diarrhoea. (The opioid drug, or drugs, from which participants were withdrawing was not specified.)</P>
<P>The studies included in this review did not report any other serious adverse effects.</P>
<P>While a number of studies considered for this review provided antagonist-based treatment in an outpatient setting, all provided extended care at least for the first day on which the opioid antagonist was administered. This reflects the desirability of providing a high level of monitoring and support until patients are comfortable and development of delirium is considered unlikely (at least several hours after administration of the antagonist).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completion of treatment and postdetoxification outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The use of naltrexone maintenance in relapse prevention treatment for opioid-dependent people has been limited by two factors: low rates of commencement on naltrexone, and low rates of retention in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2000</LINK>). Antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation is seen as one way in which rates of commencement on naltrexone might be increased.</P>
<P>The data reported in this review suggest that in some situations, antagonist-induced withdrawal may be associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion compared to regimens based primarily on an adrenergic agonist, but results are inconsistent, and the extent of any benefit is highly uncertain.</P>
<P>As indicated in the Results, the studies varied in their definitions of treatment endpoint, with only some studies clearly reporting the number of participants achieving maintenance doses of naltrexone, and hence initiating naltrexone maintenance treatment. Hence it is not possible, on the basis of the studies included in this review, to determine whether antagonist-induced withdrawal helps to increase rates of commencement in naltrexone maintenance treatment. However, any such benefit appears to be relatively short-lived, with <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK> reporting the mean duration of naltrexone treatment to be less than 10 days, and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reporting no differences in opioid-positive samples at a six-month follow-up for the group detoxified by an antagonist-based regimen compared to one based on an adrenergic agonist. <LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2007</LINK> did not report data on engagement in naltrexone maintenance treatment but did report a higher rate of abstinence at follow-up for the group receiving antagonist-based treatment. The authors considered the difference in rates of abstinence at follow-up to be generally associated with the length of stay postdetoxification rather than the detoxification procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment regimen</HEADING>
<P>A notable feature of the studies included in the review is the variability in the treatment regimens based on opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal. Points of variability include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the use of naloxone or naltrexone, or a combination of both, to induce withdrawal;</LI>
<LI>initial dose, frequency of administration, and rate of increase of the dose of opioid antagonist;</LI>
<LI>the medication used to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of withdrawal (most commonly clonidine or lofexidine but also buprenorphine); and</LI>
<LI>the nature and extent of use of additional adjunct medications.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Due to this degree of variability, it is not possible to describe a standard regimen for this form of antagonist-induced withdrawal. The small number of studies also prevented sub-comparisons to determine the effect of the above variations in treatment protocol.</P>
<P>It is of interest that two of the most recent studies adopted an approach of repeated small doses of opioid antagonist with a 50 mg dose of naltrexone achieved on day 4 and the end of day 2 (in <LINK REF="STD-Buntwal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Buntwal 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>, respectively). The authors of these studies do not report the reasoning behind their choice of dose regimen; presumably clinical experience with opioid antagonists was a factor. This approach is also reminiscent of some of the earliest studies of antagonist-induced withdrawal (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Charney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Charney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Arnold_x002d_Reed-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold-Reed 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beswick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beswick 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> used repeated doses of naloxone to induce withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2007</LINK> administered a single dose of 0.8 mg IM in the mornings of the first three days after cessation of methadone. This antagonist regimen reduced the overall withdrawal severity compared to treatment with an adrenergic agonist alone, but Bearn and colleagues note that the response to naloxone was variable. Based on the graph of mean withdrawal score from <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 2001</LINK>, the difference in overall withdrawal severity is unlikely to be clinically significant. The authors themselves note that the "addition of naloxone did not confer substantial benefit over lofexidine monotherapy".</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>, multiple doses of naloxone 0.04 mg IV were administered to a total of 0.4 mg/day for two days. Naltrexone was commenced with a single 5 mg dose on day 1, after the doses of naloxone were completed, and it increased to 50 mg by day 3. Graphs of mean daily withdrawal scores in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> show peak withdrawal severity on day 2. Gerra and colleagues note that mean withdrawal scores were higher for the group treated with opioid antagonist compared to those receiving a clonidine-based regimen, but the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests that low doses of naloxone, while apparently having little effect on the course of withdrawal, may help to prepare opioid-dependent people to tolerate subsequent doses of naltrexone.</P>

<P>The studies included in this review provided some information on the severity of withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists with minimal sedation, but this information remains scarce. There is little information on the nature of withdrawal signs and symptoms experienced by patients, the duration of significant symptoms, the overall severity, or the acceptability to patients of this approach to the management of opioid withdrawal. The studies included in this review were too small to provide accurate information on the risks of adverse effects associated with antagonist-induced withdrawal. It remains uncertain to what extent the type and dose of opioid antagonist, the use of adjunct medications, the person's drug use history (including use of heroin or methadone) may contribute to both withdrawal severity and adverse effects.</P>
<P>Buprenorphine has been shown to be more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2017</LINK>). Eight of the studies included in this review compared antagonist-induced withdrawal with a regimen based primarily on an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, and only two studies used buprenorphine as a comparison. Some authors have suggested that due to its pharmacological properties, buprenorphine can facilitate the transition from dependent opioid use to naltrexone maintenance treatment (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-02 07:45:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of an opioid antagonist (naltrexone, naloxone or both) to induce withdrawal in combination with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine) to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of withdrawal is a feasible approach to managing opioid withdrawal. Most studies investigating this approach have involved participants withdrawing from heroin, but the approach is probably also feasible for withdrawal subsequent to administration of low to moderate doses of methadone (around 40 mg/day or less).</P>
<P>The peak withdrawal severity induced by an opioid antagonist in combination with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist may be more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, while the average severity over the withdrawal period is less. However, we are uncertain of this result because we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. If the overall severity is less, this is probably because signs and symptoms of withdrawal resolve more quickly.</P>
<P>Some people may experience vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium following administration of the first dose of opioid antagonist, particularly when naltrexone is commenced at doses of 25 mg or more. To manage such side effects it is desirable to provide a high level of monitoring and support for several hours following administration of the first dose of opioid antagonist. Adjunct medications, in addition to adrenergic agonists, are likely to be required to manage the period of peak withdrawal induced by the opioid antagonist.</P>
<P>Clinicians should warn people of the possibility of delirium in the first day of administration of naltrexone. People should also know that withdrawal will be moderately severe and that symptoms such as muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhoea, and insomnia are likely to persist despite medication.</P>
<P>The data reported in this review suggest that in some situations antagonist-induced withdrawal may be associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion than regimens based primarily on an adrenergic agonist, but results are inconsistent, and the extent of any benefit is highly uncertain. There are insufficient data to determine whether opioid antagonists plus adrenergic agonists reduce the duration of withdrawal treatment or increase rates of transfer to maintenance treatment with an opioid antagonist.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-02 07:46:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is insufficient to establish a detailed picture of the nature of the opioid withdrawal syndrome induced by opioid antagonist treatment compared to that managed with an adrenergic agonist alone. Information is particularly lacking for withdrawal from methadone. There are a number of aspects of treatment regimens based on opioid antagonists for managing opioid withdrawal that would need to be explored for this approach to become established as an effective approach. However, it is notable that in undertaking this review update we did not identify any new studies to include compared to the 2009 version. Clearly, this is not an active area of research, and we believe the approach is not being used in clinical practice.</P>

There is active research in this area, particularly related to the use of buprenorphine to aid the transition to sustained-release preparations of naltrexone (<LINK REF="STD-Mannelli-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mannelli 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mogali-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mogali 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2015</LINK>). The rationale for sustained-release preparations of naltrexone is that they overcome the issue of patient adherence to the treatment regimen that has been experienced with oral naltrexone (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2007</LINK>). Facilitating the transition from opioid dependence to naltrexone maintenance is particularly important with sustained-release preparations, as any prolonged experience of opioid withdrawal would be likely to make this treatment approach unacceptable to people who are opioid dependent. It appears that this is the direction currently being taken by research. Given that the main reason for considering using opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal would be to initiate naltrexone maintenance treatment, we consider this direction to be appropriate.</P>
