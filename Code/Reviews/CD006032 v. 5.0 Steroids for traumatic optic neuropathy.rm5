<TITLE>Steroids in the treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-29 20:26:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) refers to any injury to the optic nerve secondary to trauma. After the optic nerve has been injured, it becomes more swollen and this can lead to further damage. Traumatic optic neuropathy often results in severe visual loss and the vast majority of affected people are young males in their thirties. Since the early 1980s, steroids have been used in an attempt to reduce the abnormal swelling that follows an injury to the optic nerve and improve visual recovery. However, the role of steroids in TON is controversial and clinicians remain divided over the best management strategy. The recommendations in this review are based on a critical analysis of the available evidence in the medical literature. We found only one, relatively small, randomised controlled trial of steroids in TON, which included 31 participants within seven days of their initial injury. These participants received either high dose intravenous steroids (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15). At three months follow-up, no significant difference in best corrected visual acuity was found between these two groups. There is a relatively high rate of spontaneous visual recovery in TON and no convincing data that steroids provide any additional benefit over observation alone. Each case needs to be assessed on an individual basis and the patient needs to be made fully aware of the possibility of a serious adverse reaction, although rare, to steroids. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted possible detrimental effects of steroids when used in brain and spinal cord injuries and these new lines of evidence need to be considered seriously.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is an important cause of severe visual loss following blunt or penetrating head trauma. Following the initial injury, optic nerve swelling within the optic nerve canal can result in secondary retinal ganglion cell loss. Optic nerve decompression with steroids or surgical interventions or both has therefore been advocated as a means of improving visual prognosis in TON.</P>

<P>We included one study that met our selection criteria; a double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of high dose intravenous steroids in patients with indirect TON diagnosed within seven days of the initial injury. A total of 31 eligible participants were randomised to receive either high dose intravenous steroids (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15), and they were all followed-up for three months. Mean final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.78±1.23 Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) in the placebo group, and 1.11±1.14 LogMAR in the steroid group. The mean difference in BCVA between the placebo and steroid groups was 0.67 LogMAR (95% confidence interval -1.54 to 0.20), and this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.13). At three months follow-up, an improvement in BCVA of 0.40 LogMAR occurred in eight eyes (8/15, 53.3%) in the placebo group, and in 11 eyes (11/16, 68.8%) in the treatment group.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) refers to any insult to the optic nerve secondary to trauma. It can be classified depending on the site of injury (optic nerve head, intraorbital, intracanalicular or intracranial) or according to the mode of injury (direct or indirect). Direct TON results from anatomical disruption of the optic nerve, for example, a projectile penetrating the orbit of the eye and impinging on the optic nerve. Indirect TON is caused by the transmission of forces to the optic nerve from a distant site without disruption of normal tissue structures. The deformative stress transmitted to the skull from blunt trauma is concentrated in the region of the optic canal. Since the optic nerve's dural sheath is tightly adherent to the periosteum, the intracanalicular segment is particularly susceptible to injury (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1981</LINK>). The intracranial portion of the optic nerve in close proximity to the falciform dural fold is the next most common site of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Crompton-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crompton 1970</LINK>). In one report using computed tomography (CT) scans about half of all TON cases were found to have an associated sphenoidal bone fracture, an indirect measure of the significant compressive forces involved (<LINK REF="REF-Seiff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiff 1990</LINK>). However, both direct and indirect mechanisms can contribute to optic nerve damage and a clear distinction is not always possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic optic neuropathy is an uncommon cause of visual loss following blunt or penetrating head trauma with a reported incidence of 0.7% to 2.5% in published case series (<LINK REF="REF-al_x002d_Qurainy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">al-Qurainy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmund-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmund 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nau-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nau 1987</LINK>). A recent national epidemiological survey of TON in the UK found a minimum prevalence in the general population of 1 in 1,000,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>). The vast majority of affected patients are young males (79% to 85%) in their early thirties (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1999</LINK>). The most common causes of TON in adults are motor vehicle and bicycle accidents (49%), falls (27%) and assaults (13%) (<LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 1998</LINK>). In a paediatric case series, TON was the result of a fall in 50% and a road traffic accident in 40% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Mahapatra-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahapatra 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic optic neuropathy is a clinical diagnosis supported by a history of direct or indirect trauma to the head or face. The injury can sometimes be trivial and a careful history must be elicited from the patient. Although usually straightforward, the assessment of TON can sometimes prove difficult in the setting of severe trauma when the patient's level of consciousness is impaired. It is also important to exclude possible reversible causes of visual loss that require immediate attention, for example, a retrobulbar haemorrhage.</P>
<P>The features of TON are:<BR/>1. unilateral or bilateral ocular involvement;<BR/>2. relative afferent papillary defect except in cases of symmetric, bilateral TON;<BR/>3. variable loss of visual acuity ranging from normal to no light perception. Studies have shown that 40% to 60% of patients present with severe visual loss of light perception or worse (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lessell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lessell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mauriello-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mauriello 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spoor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spoor 1990</LINK>). Direct TON causes severe and immediate visual loss with little likelihood for recovery. The prognosis is better for indirect TON but a high degree of clinical vigilance must be maintained since it can be associated with delayed visual loss secondary to the development of an optic nerve sheath haematoma;<BR/>4. impairment of colour vision;<BR/>5. variable visual field defects;<BR/>6. an optic disc appearance that will depend on the anatomical site of injury. With injuries to the optic nerve anterior to the entry point of the central retinal vessels there is optic disc swelling with associated retinal haemorrhages. With more posterior injuries, which are more common, the fundus looks normal;<BR/>7. development of optic atrophy which usually becomes evident about six weeks following the injury.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Neuroimaging</HEADING>
<P>Computerised tomography (CT) is the best imaging modality for delineating optic canal fractures but the use of neuroimaging in TON varies widely. Some clinicians request CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or both for all cases, whereas others limit them to those patients with progressive visual deterioration or when therapeutic interventions are being considered (<LINK REF="REF-Raji-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raji 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiff-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiff 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takehara-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takehara 1994</LINK>). The clinical usefulness of neuroimaging in TON remains debatable since there is no consistent correlation between the finding of an optic canal fracture, severity of visual loss and prognosis for visual recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Ishikawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishikawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Prognostic factors</HEADING>
<P>Most studies in TON show a significant association between initial and final visual acuities, patients with no light perception at presentation invariably having limited or no visual improvement. Other poor prognostic factors include loss of consciousness, lack of visual recovery after 48 hours and absence of visual evoked responses. The presence of an optic canal fracture was found to predict a poor outcome in some case series but not by others (<LINK REF="REF-Carta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajiniganth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajiniganth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tandon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). Direct TON is a distinct category that results in severe, irreversible visual loss and no intervention is of proven benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>The pathophysiology of indirect TON is likely to be multifactorial and the concept of primary and secondary injury has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Osborne-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are specialised cells within the optic nerve and form part of an intricate chain responsible for transmitting information from the eye to the vision centres within the brain. Following trauma there is an immediate shearing of a proportion of RGC axons, an irreversible process with subsequent RGC degeneration. It is postulated that there is then optic nerve swelling within the limited confines of the optic canal secondary to direct mechanical trauma or vascular ischaemia. This further impairs the already compromised blood supply to surviving RGCs setting up a downward spiral towards cell death. This model forms the rationale for optic nerve decompression, whether by medical or surgical means, in order to break this vicious cycle and preserve RGCs that survived the initial insult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The main treatment options in current use for TON are:<BR/>1. systemic steroids of varying dose, duration and mode of administration;<BR/>2. surgical decompression of the optic canal;<BR/>3. a combination of steroids and surgery;<BR/>4. observation alone i.e. conservative management.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Steroids in TON</HEADING>
<P>Steroids have been used in TON since the early 1980s and the pharmacological rationale first arose from their perceived benefits when applied to various animal models of central nervous system injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braughler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braughler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1984</LINK>). Steroids were thought to exert a neuroprotective effect following trauma, the postulated mechanism being their antioxidant properties and the inhibition of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1992</LINK>). This hypothesis was further reinforced following its clinical application to traumatic spinal cord injuries. The second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-II) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial set up to assess the benefits of megadose steroids in patients with acute spinal cord injury. The treatment regime consisted of an initial bolus dose of 30 mg/kg, followed by an infusion at 5.4 mg/kg/hr for a total duration of 23 hours. Patients who received steroids within eight hours of their injury had significantly better improvement in neurological functions compared to those in the placebo group or those who were treated after eight hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 1990</LINK>). In the third National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-III), patients who received steroids three to eight hours after their injury experienced greater motor and functional recovery when this regime was maintained for 48 hours instead of 24 hours. For those patients who were treated within three hours of injury, the neurological outcomes in the 24-hour and 48-hour arms of the trial were similar (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 1997</LINK>). Unsurprisingly, the findings of the NASCIS trials have heavily influenced clinical practice, leading to the increased use of steroids in TON since the mid 1990s.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Steroid regimes</HEADING>
<P>For the purpose of this review, we have used the following classification for the various steroid regimes used in the literature: low dose (&lt; 100 mg), moderate dose (100 to 499 mg), high dose (500 to 1999 mg), very high dose (2000 to 5399 mg) and megadose (&gt; 5400 mg), based upon the initial daily dose of methylprednisolone used (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). The equivalent dose for other steroid agents such as dexamethasone can be calculated based upon their relative potencies compared to methylprednisolone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic optic neuropathy is an important cause of severe visual loss among young adults but clinicians remain divided over the best management strategy in this condition. The role of steroids in TON remains unclear and a systematic review of the literature on this particular issue is needed to make recommendations for best practice. Surgical decompression of the optic nerve in TON has been the subject of another Cochrane review by the same authors (<LINK REF="REF-Yu_x002d_Wai_x002d_Man-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu-Wai-Man 2005</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-31 13:08:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There are several published case series in the literature looking at the role of steroids in traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) and these are discussed below (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). We identified only one double-masked, RCT comparing high dose intravenous steroids to placebo in patients with indirect TON diagnosed within seven days of the initial injury. Overall, we found no convincing evidence that steroids provide any additional visual benefit in TON.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological flaws</HEADING>
<P>All the published case series in TON suffer from several methodological flaws that render interpretation difficult. The majority are small, retrospective studies that lack the sample size for rigorous statistical analysis and the absence of adequate randomisation introduces the possibility of selection bias. An example would be patients who failed to improve with observation alone and then get reassigned to receive steroids a few days later. Because these patients probably represent a subgroup with poor potential for visual recovery, introducing these non-responders will have the effect of biasing the results against the steroid group.</P>
<P>Another criticism of some of these case series is the failure to properly document the time interval between the onset of injury and recruitment. This information is important as vision can improve spontaneously in TON (<I>see </I>below). If cases of recent onset are preferentially recruited into a treatment study, the results are more likely to demonstrate a better visual outcome compared to case series where early TON cases are not actively sought by the investigators. Furthermore, the assessment and definition of visual improvement were frequently not clearly stated. In the acute setting, the baseline visual status was often assessed at the bedside but the final outcome was always based upon subsequent clinic reviews. Presumably, most of these patients will then have had a formal refraction to determine best-corrected visual acuity, which might account for part or all of the observed improvement especially if the actual difference was small. These inherent biases in case selection and methods of outcome assessment cast doubt over the benefit reported by positive studies recommending steroids over observation in TON.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparing studies</HEADING>
<P>It is very difficult to compare different studies, even qualitatively, because of the wide range of steroid regimes used in terms of dose, duration and mode of administration. Steroids have been used both on its own and in combination with surgical optic nerve decompression either pre-, intra- or postoperatively. The most commonly used agent in TON is intravenous methylprednisolone in the very high dose to megadose range. Unfortunately, case series lack an appropriate control group, which is essential if one is to establish whether the outcome of a particular intervention is better than the natural history of the disease. The differential follow-up times in the treatment groups also prevents any valid comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">International Optic Nerve Trauma Study (IONTS)</HEADING>
<P>The International Optic Nerve Trauma Study (IONTS) is the largest, prospective, multi-centre study of TON published to date (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1999</LINK>). It was intended to be an RCT but it had to be converted to an observational study after two years due to recruitment failure. The study analysed a total of 133 people with indirect TON treated within seven days of injury and categorised into three groups: untreated (n = 9), steroids (n = 85), or optic canal decompression surgery (n = 33). The majority of the steroid group had either a megadose (40%) or very high dose regime (18%) and all the participants in the surgical group, except for one, also received steroids. Follow-up data was available for 104 cases at one month and for 40 cases at six months. After adjustment for baseline visual acuity, there were no significant differences between the three treatment groups; visual acuity increased by three lines or more in 57% of the untreated group, 52% of the steroid group and 32% of the surgery group, (P = 0.22). There was no indication that either the dose or timing of steroid treatment was associated with an increased probability of visual recovery. Although some case series report higher improvement rates with steroids, most figures are in the 44% to 62% range and therefore comparable to IONTS (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiff 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). It must be stressed also that in none of these TON studies is there any evidence of any additional functional visual benefit with steroids.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) controversy</HEADING>
<P>The application of steroids to TON relies heavily on extrapolation made from the NASCIS trials and therefore a critical appraisal of their results is appropriate. There is ongoing debate in the literature regarding the significance of the neurological benefit reported by NASCIS among patients treated within the eight-hour window of sustaining a spinal cord injury (<I>see </I>comments in <LINK REF="REF-Geisler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geisler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurlbert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurlbert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). The mean difference (MD) between the steroid group versus placebo indicated a significant benefit for motor scores (MD 5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 9.87) but not sensory scores (MD 2.41, 95% CI -1.72 to 6.54) at one-year of follow up. Critics of NASCIS argue that the finding of a beneficial effect for the early treatment group was based on a post-hoc analysis of a small subgroup of the trial, 129 out of the 487 participants, and therefore might represent a statistical artefact. Concerns have also been raised on possible randomisation imbalance between the treatment arms, which might have biased the results in favour of the steroid group. For clinicians, perhaps the most compelling argument is that although statistically significant, the relatively small change in motor scores might not translate into any functional benefit. A Cochrane review on steroids for acute spinal cord injury has not resolved the controversy surrounding the NASCIS trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 2012</LINK>). Its conclusions support the notion that steroids enhance neurological recovery when administered within eight hours of spinal cord injury but the impartiality of this review has been questioned on the basis that the author was one of the principal investigators of the NASCIS trials.</P>
<P>Irrespective of the arguments surrounding the NASCIS results, the unanswered question remains whether extrapolating data from the spinal cord to TON is biologically plausible. The optic nerve is a predominantly "white matter" tract and differs histologically from the spinal cord in both its cellular environment and organisation. Furthermore, there is no comparative data on the actual concentration of active metabolites achieved locally within the optic nerve and the spinal cord following intravenous steroid injections. Unfortunately, these issues add further to the uncertainties of using steroids in TON.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Practical issues</HEADING>
<P>There are practical limitations to applying the NASCIS findings given the narrow window of opportunity available for initiating treatment. There are often unavoidable delays in diagnosing TON when patients have life threatening injuries and these have to take precedence before an ophthalmological opinion is sought. If the patient is unconscious for a prolonged period of time, visual loss is likely to be reported late and even if a clinical diagnosis is made within eight hours, there are ethical considerations to starting controversial treatment without proper informed consent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Spontaneous visual recovery</HEADING>
<P>A visual recovery rate of 40% to 60% has been reported for indirect TON cases managed conservatively, with baseline visual acuity being the most important predictor of final outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiff 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>). These figures are very much comparable with those achieved in patients treated with steroids, surgery or a combination of both. Consistent with these earlier case series, the RCT included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Entezari-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Entezari 2007</LINK>) provides additional convincing evidence that high dose intravenous steroids does not improve visual outcome when administered in the acute stage, i.e. within seven days of onset of TON.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>If the benefits of a therapeutic intervention are unclear or likely to be small, it becomes even more important to consider the possible adverse effects. The more important studies in the literature regarding the safety profile of different steroid regimes are summarised below.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>a. High dose steroids</I>
</B>
<BR/>The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) used a high dose steroid regime: 250 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone every six hours for three days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisolone for 11 days. Only two participants (1.3%) in the intravenous methylprednisolone group had serious side effects, one case of acute psychosis and one case of acute pancreatitis, both resolving without sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>b. Very high dose steroids</I>
</B>
<BR/>A meta-analysis has been published of about 2000 patients from 51 studies receiving very high dose intravenous methylprednisolone prior to elective and trauma surgery, not requiring intensive care. Pooled data failed to show any significant increase in complication rates although more cases of gastrointestinal bleeding and wound complications were observed in the steroid group (<LINK REF="REF-Sauerland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauerland 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>c. Megadose steroids</I>
</B>
<BR/>Although not statistically significant, gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 5.49) and wound infections (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.48 to 4.56) were observed more frequently in NASCIS-II patients treated with steroids for 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 1990</LINK>). In NASCIS-III, there was a trend towards more cases of severe sepsis (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.38) and severe pneumonia (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 7.15) in those on the extended steroid regime of 48 hours instead of just 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, these studies indicate that steroids are relatively safe but serious complications can occur and these need to be considered, especially if pre-existing susceptibility factors are present.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>d. Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) study</I>
</B>
<BR/>The CRASH study was recently published and its findings are relevant to the present discussion on the role of steroids in TON (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2005</LINK>). It was a large RCT investigating the effectiveness and safety of steroids in patients with acute traumatic brain injury. Patients presenting within eight hours of head trauma were allocated to either placebo or megadose intravenous methylprednisolone (2 g over one hour followed by 0.4 g/h for 48 hours). The initial protocol was to recruit 20,000 participants but the trial was terminated prematurely after 10,008 people had been enrolled. This decision was reached by the data monitoring and ethics committee after interim statistical analysis of the results showed that steroids were having a detrimental effect. At six months follow up, the risk of death was higher in the steroid group than in the placebo group (25.7% versus 22.3%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24; P = 0.0001), as was the risk of death or severe disability (38.1% versus 36.3%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.10; P = 0.079). There was no evidence that the effect of steroids differed by timing of injury or severity. This landmark trial and a recent Cochrane review on corticosteroids for acute traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>) both conclude that steroids should no longer be routinely used in patients with traumatic brain injury. The findings of the CRASH study must therefore be seriously considered in the subgroup of TON patients who have co-existing head injuries. The underlying mechanism for the increased mortality in the group treated with steroids remains to be elucidated.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>e. Animal studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>Experimental models of TON have been developed and the most widely used one involves a direct, mechanical crush injury to the rat's optic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Levkovitch_x002d_Verbin" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levkovitch-Verbin</LINK>). Although one should be cautious when extrapolating evidence from animal studies, these have provided important insights into the pathophysiology of optic nerve injury and the effects of steroids. In two studies, rats treated with various regimes of methylprednisolone were compared with sham controls following an optic nerve crush injury. One study failed to show any difference on retinal ganglion cells survival and axonal regeneration between the two groups (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2004</LINK>). However, the other study found that steroids exacerbated axonal loss and there was a significant, dose-dependent decline in axon counts with increasing doses of steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2000</LINK>). These conclusions are thought provoking and some investigators now believe that steroids can exert a negative effect on neuronal survival by suppressing key events in an endogenous neuroprotective pathway (<LINK REF="REF-Diem-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diem 2003</LINK>). For this reason, a maximum daily dose of 1g methylprednisolone, or equivalent, has been advocated in TON to minimise the risk of neurotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Steinsapir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsapir 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is a relatively high rate of spontaneous visual recovery in traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) and there is no convincing evidence that steroids provide any additional benefit over conservative management. Each case needs to be assessed on an individual basis and the patient needs to be made fully aware of both the theoretical risks suggested by recent studies, and the real risks, although rare, of a serious adverse reaction to steroids.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-29 20:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The logistics required for an adequately powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) in TON are daunting, and it is unclear whether additional RCTs looking at a very high dose or megadose steroids would be ethical given the current evidence. Areas of prevention should be explored further to determine whether public health strategies are effective in reducing the incidence of TON in high-risk groups. Recent animal studies and the CRASH trial have also highlighted significant gaps in our understanding of central nervous system injuries and there is an urgent need for further research into the role of steroids in modulating neuronal recovery.</P>
