<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Donepezil is beneficial for people with mild, moderate and severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia affecting older people, and is associated with loss of cholinergic neurons in parts of the brain. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts and so enhance cholinergic neurotransmission.<BR/>Donepezil is beneficial for people with mild, moderate and severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, in being associated with improvements in cognitive function and activities of daily living. Adverse effects were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug and were the most likely cause of withdrawal from treatment in the first 12 weeks. Effects on cognition remained measurable and statistically significant at 52 weeks of treatment in one study.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option. The debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice, and because of the cost of the drug.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One of the aims of therapy is to inhibit the breakdown of a chemical neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, by blocking the relevant enzyme. This can be done by a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess whether donepezil improves the well-being of patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'E2020' and 'Aricept' on 5 April 2006. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases.</P>
<P>Members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was compared with placebo for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>24 trials are included, involving 5796 participants, of which 15 reported results in sufficient detail for the meta-analyses. Most trials were of 6 months or less duration in selected patients. Patients in 20 trials had mild to moderate disease, in two trials moderate to severe, and in two severe disease. Available outcome data cover domains including cognitive function, activities of daily living, behaviour, global clinical state, adverse events and health care resource costs.</P>
<P>For cognition there is a statistically significant improvement for both 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil at 24 weeks compared with placebo on the ADAS-Cog scale (-2.01 points MD, 95%CI -2.69 to -1.34, P &lt; 0.00001); -2.80 points, MD 95% CI -3.74 to -2.10, P &lt; 0.00001) and for 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks (5.55 SIB points, 95% CI 3.60 to 7.49, p&lt;0.00001) and 52 weeks (1.84 MMSE points, 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.15, P =0.006). </P>
<P>The results show some improvement in global clinical state (assessed by a clinician) in people treated with 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks for the number of patients showing improvement (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.19, P = &lt; 0.00001, OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.35, P &lt; 0.00001). Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour, but not on the quality of life score. There were significantly more withdrawals before the end of treatment from the 10 mg/day (289/1125 24% 10 mg/day vs 219/1079 20% placebo, OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65, P = 0.003) but not the 5 mg/day, (100/561 18% 5 mg/day vs 109/568 19% placebo, OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24, P = 0.56) donepezil group compared with placebo which may have resulted in some overestimation of beneficial changes at 10 mg/day. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. The results were similar for all severities of disease.<BR/>Two studies presented results for health resource use, and the associated costs. There were no significant differences between treatment and placebo for any item, the cost of any item, and for the total costs, and total costs including the informal carer costs. </P>
<P>Many adverse events were recorded, with more incidents of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle cramps, dizziness, fatigue and anorexia (significant risk associated with treatment) in the 10 mg/day group, compared with placebo. There were more incidents of anorexia, diarrhoea, and muscle cramps in the 5 mg/day group compared with placebo, but not of dizziness, fatigue, nausea or vomiting. Very few patients left a trial as a direct result of the intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>People with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12, 24 or 52 weeks with donepezil experienced benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and behaviour. Study clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients, and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option. The debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Dementia is a syndrome of acquired deficits in multiple domains of cognition severe enough to interfere with everyday life and not due to impaired consciousness or the effects of a systemic illness. These cognitive impairments (of memory, orientation, language, visual perception, executive function, praxis etc) are accompanied by progressive deterioration in ability to carry out activities of daily living, along with the appearance of challenging behaviours and other psychiatric features. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, and may be involved in as much as 80% of cases and is a primary degenerative disease of the brain of unknown cause. Clinical features include insidious onset, most commonly in later life, and characteristic brain pathology with progressive loss of neurons and the neuropathological presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Progression is evident as increasing impairment of memory developing gradually into a global impairment of cognition, including orientation, language, judgement, perceptual ability and praxis (the ability to carry out complex actions). The clinical course is accompanied by growing disability and dependency on carers. A characteristic feature of the disease is a widely variable rate of progression in different patients. </P>
<P>Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, and abnormalities in cholinergic neurons (including cell loss) are prominent among the pathological changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. One approach to lessening the impact of these abnormalities is to inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Donepezil (Aricept, E2020) is a second generation cholinesterase inhibitor and appears to have fewer side effects than earlier drugs of its class.</P>
<P>The efficacy of a treatment may vary with the severity of dementia. Randomized trials of donepezil for groups of patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease have been reported. Severity of dementia can be conceptualized as follows (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1988</LINK>):</P>
<P>Mild dementia - impairment of attention and memory; forgetting of recent information; occasional confusion or disorientation; some help needed with everyday activities</P>
<P>Moderate dementia - amnesia for recent events; some disorientation for time and place; impairment of reasoning and ability to understand events, resulting in dependency on others in personal care and routine daily tasks</P>
<P>Severe dementia - incoherent speech; disorientation for time, place and person; failure to recognise close relatives, incontinence of urine and faeces; complete dependence on others for basic personal care.</P>
<P>In practice, for the purposes of clinical trials severity of dementia is usually defined in terms of score on a scale of cognitive function, typically the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE, <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is concerned with the effects of donepezil on people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.<BR/>A secondary objective is to assess the cost effectiveness of donepezil.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All unconfounded, randomized trials of patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in which treatment with donepezil was administered for more than a day and compared with a placebo group were studied. Trials in which the allocation to treatment or control was not randomized, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed, were excluded. This is because prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased patient allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients were diagnosed as having probable Alzheimer's disease consistent with criteria such as <LINK REF="REF-ICD_x002d_10" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD-10</LINK>, DSM (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) and NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Donepezil given at any dose for more than one day with parallel concomitant placebo control.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcomes of interest are:<BR/> 1. cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests)<BR/> 2. clinical global impression<BR/> 3. changes in global disease severity<BR/> 4. performance of activities of daily living<BR/> 5. behavioural disturbance<BR/> 6. quality of life<BR/> 7. effect on carer<BR/> 8. dependency (such as institutionalization)<BR/> 9. death<BR/>10. acceptability of treatment as measured by withdrawal from trial<BR/>11. safety as measured by the incidence of adverse effects (including side-effects) leading to withdrawal<BR/>12. direct and indirect costs.</P>
<P>Physiological outcomes such as plasma levels, changes on functional imaging or EEG changes are noted but not assessed as they are not primarily measures of efficacy.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>

<BR/>The search strategies used to identify relevant records in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS can be found in the Group's module.</P>
<P>Pharmaceutical companies: members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc were contacted; Eisai Inc has made extensive information available including results from 134, 161, 201, 301, 302 and 304. </P>
<P>An additional Internet search using Copernic 2000 was performed on 21 and 22 June 2005 using trial names and numbers. No new trials were found other than the ones that had already been found in the update search of the CDCIG Register on 12 June 2005; we did find additional references to existing trials. Eisai/Pfizer, FDA, EMEA and NICE websites were searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A single reviewer (JSB) discarded irrelevant publications, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that an article could be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment.</P>
<P>The same reviewer (JSB) independently reviewed the trials for inclusion from the culled citation list. </P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>The same reviewer assessed the methodological quality of each trial. The quality of the methodology of each selected trial was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-_x0026_-Oxman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow &amp; Oxman 1997</LINK>) and the quality guidelines concerning blinding and loss before analysis developed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>The quality of randomization of allocation of subjects was judged by the following criteria:</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation;<BR/>(ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy;<BR/>(iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants;<BR/>(iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or<BR/>(v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes;<BR/>(vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provide assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) use of a 'list' of 'table' to allocate assignments;<BR/>(ii) use of 'envelopes' or 'sealed envelopes';<BR/>(iii) stating the study as 'randomized' without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) alternation;<BR/>(ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach;<BR/>(iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials are included if they conformed to categories A or B, and those falling into category C are excluded.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB) and cross-checked. </P>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of people in each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available. </P>
<P>For binary data the number in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. </P>
<P>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months before. </P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every person assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the person was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial were sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>Data from 'open-label' follow-on phases after the randomized study were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomized, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The outcomes measured in trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) are required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. For cross-over trials only the data from the first treatment period are used.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time will be assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome is the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardized mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation when they used different rating scales or tests. </P>
<P>The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the range is considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis the data are divided into smaller time periods and a separate meta-analysis conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been made.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as improvement or no improvement, the odds ratio is used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials is calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effects model is presented and tests for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic are performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The eight studies previously included in the review were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil in patients with mild to moderately severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, except <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK>, which was designed to examine efficacy, safety and tolerability in the management of very elderly residents with Alzheimer's disease in nursing homes, particularly the effect of donepezil on neuropsychiatric manifestations, and <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK>, which specifically recruits patients from clinical practice (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The eight studies reviewed have all been reported since 1996. <LINK REF="STD-Study-201" TYPE="STUDY">Study 201</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-301_x002f_303" TYPE="STUDY">Study 301/303</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK> were all supported by Eisai Inc. <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> was supported by Eisai Inc. The <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> was supported by Pfizer Inc. The <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Aging, Bethesda. It is not clear how <LINK REF="STD-Study-134" TYPE="STUDY">Study 134</LINK> was supported.</P>
<P>The studies had many features in common. They were all multicentre, randomized and double-blind. Seven were parallel group studies, and <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> was a cross-over study. Five studies were based in the USA, two in Europe and one in Japan. All trials compared donepezil with placebo. The characteristics of the studies at baseline are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Donepezil appears to have no serious side effects and there is no need for a prolonged dose-titration period. The doses used in the phase III trials were within the range shown to be clinically useful and reasonably well tolerated in the earlier studies. Treatment was once daily. When the dose of donepezil was 5 mg/day or less, the patients began with the full dose; with a 10 mg/day the initial dose was 5 mg/day for one week followed by the full dose for <LINK REF="STD-Study-301_x002f_303" TYPE="STUDY">Study 301/303</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK>. For the two later studies, <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK>, the time on 5 mg/day was 4 weeks, before increasing to 10 mg/day. The forced titration schemes were blinded. <LINK REF="STD-Study-134" TYPE="STUDY">Study 134</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-201" TYPE="STUDY">Study 201</LINK> were dose-finding studies. </P>
<P>In all eight studies diagnosis for probable Alzheimer's disease was made according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with patients also fitting DSM-III-R illness categories 290.00 or 290.10 in six studies. The severity of the disease was measured by the MMSE scale, and patients had been recruited with mild to moderate dementia, (MMSE 10-26) in <LINK REF="STD-Study-201" TYPE="STUDY">Study 201</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-301_x002f_303" TYPE="STUDY">Study 301/303</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> recruited patients with MMSE between 5 and 26 inclusive and consequently the mean MMSE at baseline (14.4) was lower than that in the other studies. <LINK REF="STD-Study-134" TYPE="STUDY">Study 134</LINK> did not use the MMSE. <LINK REF="STD-Study-134" TYPE="STUDY">Study 134</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-201" TYPE="STUDY">Study 201</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-301_x002f_303" TYPE="STUDY">Study 301/303</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK> required a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) at screening and baseline. The <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> study assessed patients at baseline using the MMSE and the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), but the inclusion criterion was the ability to undergo cognitive testing.</P>
<P>The list of exclusions was quite extensive and consistent across the phase II and III studies. Patients were excluded if they had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or other endocrine disorder, asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease or clinically significant uncontrolled gastrointestinal hepatic or cardiovascular diseases. Patients known to be hypersensitive to cholinesterase inhibitors or who had taken tacrine or other investigational medicines within one month of baseline were excluded. Concomitant medications such as anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics were not allowed. Drugs with central nervous system (CNS) activity were prohibited or partially restricted. The <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> study was more inclusive that the other studies allowing any concomitant medication showing stable doses for four weeks prior to randomization. The patients included in <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> were on average older than in the other studies, and were more likely to have comorbid illness. They were required to have reported at a frequency of several times a week at least one symptom from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>UPDATE MAY 2003</B>
<BR/>An additional 9 studies were included when the review was updated in May 2003. <LINK REF="STD-Study-161" TYPE="STUDY">Study 161</LINK> is a multicentre, phase III study carried out in Japan, funded by Eisai, with a similar protocol to the Eisai phase III studies, except that only the lower dose of donepezil, 5 mg/day was tested and patients began with a lower dose for the first week. <LINK REF="STD-Study-203" TYPE="STUDY">Study 203</LINK>, with only 28 patients, was primarily aimed at investigating brain glucose metabolism; <LINK REF="STD-Study-204" TYPE="STUDY">Study 204</LINK>, with 67 patients investigated the effect of donepezil on brain N-acetyl-asparate and myoinositol levels; <LINK REF="STD-Study-205" TYPE="STUDY">Study 205</LINK>, with 12 patients investigated the effect on visuospatial attention and <LINK REF="STD-Study-306" TYPE="STUDY">Study 306</LINK>, with 39 patients, investigated whether Apo E genotype predicted response to donepezil. <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK> is a large, multi-centred trial designed to evaluate the stress on carers. There is very little published information on these five trials. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Study-312_x002f_314" TYPE="STUDY">Study 312/314</LINK> investigated the effect of donepezil on the preservation of function over a one-year period. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to the phase III studies, except for baseline MMSE which was approximately 5 points lower on average and for the requirement that patients had to be able to perform 8 of 10 instrumental activities of daily living and 5 of 6 basic activities of daily living, each scored on a scale of 0 (no impairment ) to 3 (very severe impairment) to a level no greater than 2. The primary endpoint was time to clinically evident decline in function, as defined in the protocol. Patients reaching this endpoint left the trial and received donepezil treatment. It was not possible to include the results of this trial in the meta-analyses due to the removal of patients from the study. The only valid outcome was the number in each group reaching the primary endpoint.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> randomized 566 patients with AD, with or without vascular dementia, to 12 weeks of 5 mg/day donepezil or placebo, and then re-randomized them to donepezil (5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo for another 48 weeks of treatment. Thus the trial is partially of a cross-over design, some patients changed treatments, other did not. In addition suitable patients were randomized to aspirin or aspirin avoidance. This trial was carried out independently of the pharmaceutical company. Unfortunately there are still no results available from this trial although it was completed two years ago.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> recruited patients with probable or possible AD of moderate to severe severity. Causes of the dementia, other than Alzheimer's disease, had to be ruled out. Patients randomized to donepezil took 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg/day for 20 weeks if the higher dose was tolerated. The trial was supported by Pfizer Inc and Eisai Co Ltd.</P>
<P>The description of the studies at baseline is reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> reports the outcome measures used in the individual trials. The details of the cognitive tests and rating scales are described below.</P>

<B>UPDATE October 2005<BR/>
</B>5 new studies were included. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hegerl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hegerl 2003</LINK> is a small pilot study of 40 participants diagnosed with probable AD according to DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA, designed to investigate whether donepezil is associated with parkinsonian effects in AD patients, by assessing cognition and hand-motor function. It was supported by Pfizer Inc. and Eisai Europe. <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK>, funded by Pfizer/Eisai, was designed to investigate the efficacy of donepezil in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild to moderate AD with neuropsychiatric symptoms already present. There was an initial open-label phase of 5 mg/day for 6 weeks, followed by 10 mg/day for 6 weeks, before randomization to donepezil, 10 mg/day or placebo for another 12 weeks. Many participants did not reach the second phase because they had suffered adverse events or an increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Participants were removed from the second phase if their MMSE had declined by 2 or more points.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2004</LINK> is a small study of 31 participants with mild to moderate AD already taking 10 mg/day donepezil to assess the safety and tolerability of higher doses of donepezil. Patients were randomized to either placebo or a further dose of 5 increasing to 10 mg/day donepezil over 24 weeks. It is funded by Pfizer/Eisai.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Study-402" TYPE="STUDY">Study 402</LINK>, a 24 week parallel group study of 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo, evaluated the efficacy of donepezil in patients with early stage AD. The mean MMSE at baseline was 24.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-AWARE" TYPE="STUDY">AWARE</LINK> enrolled patients with mild to moderate AD initially in a 24 week open label phase, (5 mg/day donepezil for 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg/day). Patients classified as showing uncertain benefit during this phase, no change or decline on the MMSE and assessment on the physician's global impression, were randomized to a 12 week, double blind, placebo controlled 12 week phase. The dose of donepezil in the second phase is not stated. The outcome measure was the NPI. The study was funded by Pfizer Inc and Eisai Inc. <BR/>

<P>An economic valuation of donepezil from the <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> has been published. </P>
<P>An extensive description of and the results from <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> have been published. The trial was designed with the intention of recruiting 3000 people, but only 566 were randomized. When this UK based trial started in 2000 donepezil was not available on the National Health Service (NHS), but became available in 2001. This affected not only recruitment, but retention because patients already randomized left the trial to benefit from open-label prescription of donepezil. Any patient referred to a memory clinic was potentially eligible if they were diagnosed (DSM IV) with dementia of Alzheimer type with or without a coexisting diagnosis of vascular dementia (16% of patients). Only 86% (486/566) of patients randomized at baseline entered the second randomization at 12 weeks. During the next 48 weeks of treatment 40% (193) of patients are lost, 32 deaths, 42 to institutional care, 62 stop treatment and 57 withdraw to open label donepezil. The trial continued with a 6 week washout before beginning a further 48 weeks of treatment (no further randomization), but only 194 out of 293 finishing the previous phase entered. After the second 48 week phase there was a 4 week washout, another 48 weeks of treatment, 4 week washout and 48 weeks of treatment. In theory treatment could continue for 204 weeks, but the loss of patients continued at a substantial rate. <BR/>The two primary endpoints were entry to an institution, and loss of either 2 of 4 basic, or 6 of 11 instrumental activities on the BADLS. Secondary outcome measures were functional ability (BADLS), behavioural symptoms as assessed by the NPI, MMSE, psychological wellbeing of the carer (GHQ-30), and death from Alzheimer's disease.<BR/>In addition costs, including NHS, social services and private, were assessed, from information provided by the carer and by the family doctor, and costed using national (UK) average unit costs for each item, for example a stay in hospital. </P>

<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK>, a placebo controlled, 6 month study conducted in Sweden and funded by Pfizer, was designed to investigate the efficacy of donepezil in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. The 241 patients were living in assisted care nursing homes. Their baseline MMSE was between 1 and 10 points.

<B>Description of tests and rating scales using in the included studies<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Global Assessment</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. A Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change scale (CIBIC-Plus) (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1997</LINK>) was used in four studies. It provides a global rating of patient function in four areas, general, cognitive, behaviour and activities of daily living. All patients are scored on global severity at baseline and subsequent assessments on a scale of 1-7 are relative to baseline, with 1 showing marked improvement, 7 marked worsening with 4 representing no change. Information is obtained from the caregiver and patient and the clinician is blind to all other measures. <BR/>2. The <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> used the Gottfries, Brane and Steen scale (GBS) (<LINK REF="REF-Gottfries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottfries 1982</LINK>) for the global assessment. The GBS is a comprehensive scale for rating dementia syndromes, based on a semi-structured interview with the caregiver. A seven-point scoring system, from 0 (normal function) to 6 (maximum disturbance or presence of symptoms) measures orientation, memory and concentration (12 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional function (3 items) and pathological aspects of behaviour (6 items).<BR/>3. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1988</LINK>) is usually reported as a score, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 but these scores are derived from ratings in six domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care), each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe dementia) and the sum of the ratings (0-18) provides the CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB). <BR/>4. <LINK REF="STD-Study-161" TYPE="STUDY">Study 161</LINK> used the MENFIS (<LINK REF="REF-Homma-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homma 1991</LINK>) which is a modification of the GBS. It evaluates cognitive function (7 items), motivational function (3 items) and emotional function (3 items).<BR/>5. <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> used the clinical global impression of improvement scale (CGI-C) (<LINK REF="REF-ECDEU-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDEU 1976</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cognitive Function </LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The primary cognitive test in nine studies was the cognitive part of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>), modified and called the ADAS-Jcog for Japanese patients. ADAS-Cog comprises 11 individual tests, spoken language ability (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5), recall of test instructions (0-5), word finding difficulty (0-5), following commands (0-5), naming object (0-5), construction drawing (0-5), ideational praxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), word recall (0-10) and word recognition (0-12). The total score ranges from 0-70, the high score indicating greater impairment. The ADAS-Jcog is not quite equivalent to the ADAS-Cog, using ideograms and ideographic memory as well as verbal memory. The scoring and subtests are different.<BR/>2. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) evaluates cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall, and language. The test takes only 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal).<BR/>3. The QoL (<LINK REF="REF-Blau-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blau 1977</LINK>) is a self-rated seven item scale, based on a 'social indicators' approach, examining relationships, eating and sleeping, and social and leisure activity. The items are scored on an analogue scale between 0 (worst quality) and 50 (best). The Blau scale originally contained 10 items, and it is unclear both how the 7 items were chosen, and whether the scale has been validated for use in people with dementia.<BR/>4. The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) (<LINK REF="REF-Panisset-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panisset 1994</LINK>) is a 40-item questionnaire designed to assess the severity of cognitive disfunction in advanced AD and is divided into 9 domains: memory, language, orientation , attention, proxis, visuospatial, construction, orientation to name, and social interaction. The score ranges from 0(greatest impairment) to 100(no impairment).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Activities of daily living:</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> used the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS) (<LINK REF="REF-DeJong-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeJong 1989</LINK>), which is a disease specific measure of changes in 29 items of the activities of daily living. The interview is conducted with the caregiver. DeJong describes this scale as a measure of quality of life for AD, on account of the correlation between ability to perform ADLs and quality of life.<BR/>2. <LINK REF="STD-Study-161" TYPE="STUDY">Study 161</LINK> used the CMCS, which is derived from the Crichton geriatric rating scale. A nine-point scoring system, from 0 (normal function) to 8 (maximum disturbance or presence of symptoms) measures orientation, communication, cooperation, restlessness, ability to dress, work and social activities and leisure. The range of scores is 0-56. Strictly this scale is a more comprehensive scale than an ADL scale.<BR/>3. <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> used the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00e9_linas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gélinas 1999</LINK>) a 10 domain, 40 item instrument that measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living. A higher score indicates less behavioural symptomatology.<BR/>4. <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> used the IADL (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1969</LINK>), modified for to assess people with moderate to severe dementia. The IADL scale assesses the ability to perform eight complex daily tasks: ability to use the telephone, shopping, food preparation, household tasks, laundry, transportation, responsibility for medications and ability to manage finances. The modified version omits the laundry item and includes items from the Alzheimer's Disease Functional Assessment Change Scale (ADFACS) relating to managing household appliances, mail, hobbies and the ability to get around inland outside home.<BR/>5. <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> uses the PSMS (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1969</LINK>), a 6 item scale that rates self care ability (toileting, feeding, dressing, personal hygiene, locomotion and bathing). The modified version used includes three extra items believed to be important for the provision of basic ADL in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (loss of recognition of carer, impaired ambulation and wandering).<BR/>6. <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> used the BADLS (<LINK REF="REF-Bucks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucks 1996</LINK>).<BR/>7. <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> used the Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living inventory for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-severe) (<LINK REF="REF-Galasko-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 2000</LINK>). This is a 19 item scale for basic and complex abilities validated in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Total score ranges from 0 to 54 (no impairment). Items include basic activities of daily living (eating, bathing0 and complex (operating taps, switching lights).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Behavioural Disturbance</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Neuropsychiatric Instrument (NPI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>), a 12 item, carer rated instrument, was used by <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK> to evaluate behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behaviour, night-time behaviour, and appetite/eating disorder. Frequency is rated from 1 (occasional, less than once a week) to 4 (very frequent) and severity from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The product of frequency and severity ranges from 1 to 12, with a total score ranging from 12 to 120 for the 10 domains summed. A lower score indicates improvement.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stress on carers</LI>
</UL>
<P>The abridged Relative Stress Scale (aRSS) is a self assessment scale for carers. They rate their stress on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme stress) on 10 items which cover their experience of dealing with a person with AD. This outcome is assessed only in the <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK> trial.<BR/>The NPI-D, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Distress scale assesses the degree of distress caused to the carer by the 10 individual items (each scores 0-5) of the NPI.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> assessed the psychological wellbeing of the carer using the GHQ-30 (0-30) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1988</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Health Resource Utilization</LI>
</UL>
<P>This outcome is assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> study. At a time within 2 days of a clinic visit, carers kept records of the time per day they spent assisting with instrumental and basic ADL using a version of the IADL+ and the PSMS scale. The total time over the study period was calculated by multiplying the estimate per day by the number of days since the last clinic visit. The utilization of health resources by patients and carers was measured using the Canadian Utilization of Services Tracking (CAUST) questionnaire and the carer time assessment. This covered many items which belonged to one of the following categories: community medical care, hospitalizations and residential care for the patient and medical care, hospitalizations and counseling for the carer. <BR/>The analysis of the CAUST data included those services that were considered to be AD-related. <BR/>For those who left the study before the end, the use of services over the entire 24 week period was estimated using the LOCF principle. For other missing data, where there was no previous observation, imputed values were used based on the assessment data of patients from the same country of similar MMSE.<BR/>Costs were calculated for patients and carers in each treatment group based on unit prices, based on Ontario fees schedules regardless of the country in which the patient lived for each resource. There are estimates of costs for carer time helping with ADLs, based on the average Ontario minimum wage of CAN$6.85/hour. <BR/>Although the health resource utilization was quite different over the three countries, Canada, France and Australia, the mean for each item over all patients was used in the analyses. The group means and mean costs for each item, summaries over categories and overall totals are reported. The costs were assessed in 1998.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> also reported on the direct and indirect costs of caring for an AD patient, and included the informal costs for care provided by the carer, assessed using the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) (<LINK REF="REF-Wimo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wimo 1998</LINK>) questionnaire at baseline, and weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52. RUD covers for the patients' study medication, use of social services and living accommodation, and for patients' and carers' hospitalization, visits to healthcare professionals, concomitant medication, and for carers' time caring for patients or missed work. The study includes people from Finland and Sweden, with smaller numbers from Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. The costs are reported in 1999 values, converted from Swedish kroner to US$, using a mean conversion rate for 1999.</P>
<P>In all studies assessments were carried out at more than one time point between the base line assessment and the reported end-point.</P>
<P>Details of adverse events were ascertained by the questioning of each patient at each assessment. Serious adverse events were reported immediately. </P>
<P>The reported analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, which included all patients who were randomized to treatment, assessed at baseline, received at least one dose of the study drug, and had at least one post baseline assessment. The ITT population consisted of those who provided complete data at endpoint regardless of compliance (the observed cases OC) plus the LOCF population, (the last observation on double-blind treatment carried forward), for whom the last observation on double-blind treatment was carried forward to endpoint. These data were analysed by the investigators in the endpoint analyses, which were the primary analyses and are described as ITT-LOCF.</P>
<P>The change from baseline of continuous outcome measures was analysed by analysis of variance which included the centre, the treatment, centre by treatment interaction, and baseline score in the model. The ordinal data were analysed either as continuous data using analysis of variance, or as ordinal data using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and with adjustments for centre if necessary.</P>

<P>The reports of <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK> described the allocation to treatment group as assigned by a computerized randomization schedule, that of <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> as assigned by a computerized randomization schedule generated by a biostatistician and concealed from all study personnel. <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> described in detail the method of computerized block randomization.</P>
<P>The number of drop-outs was usually small, except for <LINK REF="STD-Study-312_x002f_314" TYPE="STUDY">Study 312/314</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK>, i.e. under 20%, and the numbers were similar for treatment and control groups within a study, except for the treatment group taking 10 mg/day of donepezil with slightly higher drop-out rates. The main cause of drop-outs was an adverse event.</P>
<P>The primary end-point for <LINK REF="STD-Study-312_x002f_314" TYPE="STUDY">Study 312/314</LINK> was time to clinically evident decline in function, as defined in the protocol. Patients reaching this end-point left the trial and received donepezil treatment. It was not possible to include most of the results of this trial in the meta-analyses owing to the withdrawal of patients. It was possible to consider the time to clinically evident decline in function, but other outcomes would be biased due to possible differential dropout which could be related to treatment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> was planned as a trial of 3000 participants, yet randomized less than 600. With less than one fifth of the planned numbers the trial failed to achieve its objectives. The design of <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> was complex. Patients were randomized twice, at baseline and at 12 weeks, making it difficult to define a patient's treatment status which adds to the complexities of the analyses. The reason given for this double randomization does not make sense, it does not provide two independent 12-week assessments, nor would this be seen as a priority when testing donepezil. There had been plenty of short term assessments, but little was known about the treatment effect over the longer term. Not only did the trial fail to achieve the target recruitment, but many were also leaving the trial. Reasons for the loss of patients were death, institutionalization, simple withdrawal and withdrawal to open-label donepezil. In the first year of this trial 40% of patients were lost, and some of this loss was related to treatment. The losses continued over the several phases of this long trial. The trialists have analysed the data from the trial using complex multilevel models which take account of the repeated measurements on patients, the change in their treatment status and the time of leaving the trial. These analyses and results do not translate easily into the form required for the meta-analyses, and in addition interpretation is hindered by the differential loss of patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK> removed people from the randomized phase. There was an initial open-label phase of 5 mg/day for 6 weeks, followed by 10 mg/day for 6 weeks before randomization to donepezil 10 mg/day or placebo for another 12 weeks. Many participants did not reach the second phase because they had suffered adverse events or an increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Participants were removed from the second phase if their MMSE had declined by 2 or more points. This is a small trial, approximately 100 people. Many did not complete the initial open label phase, and those that did could be removed. It is almost impossible to draw any useful conclusions from this trial.</P>
<P>There are serious concerns about the methodological quality of <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK>. There is limited information available as this trial has never been published except in conference proceedings. These proceedings report that five people took the wrong treatment. This appears to be a trial that was not well conducted.</P>
<P>All the included studies were described as double-blind.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>There are 24 included studies, 15 of which reported results in sufficient detail for analysis, and two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Study-204" TYPE="STUDY">Study 204</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-205" TYPE="STUDY">Study 205</LINK>, contributed a tiny amount of data. <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK> contributed no data to the meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK>, was a two-period cross-over study, with no wash-out between the two treatment periods. Results from the first period would have been included in the meta-analyses, but were not reported separately, and therefore could not be used. Detailed results have been published from <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> but few are reported in this review as they are difficult to interpret and are not considered reliable. Extraction for the meta-analyses and interpretation of the published results is not straight forward due to the complex design of the study and the form in which results were reported. The results from <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-AWARE" TYPE="STUDY">AWARE</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Hegerl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hegerl 2003</LINK> are not published with sufficient detail to allow extraction of the data for the meta-analyses. There are serious concerns about the methodological quality of <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2004</LINK> published data on the number of adverse events. The results from <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK> are difficult to interpret and are considered unreliable. </P>
<P>The main objective of each study is reported in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. The 15 contributing studies examined the cognitive, functional and global effects of donepezil. The results for two treatment groups, 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil were analysed separately, and for three different end points, 12, 24 and 52 weeks. Smaller doses than 5 mg day had been used in the Phase II dose-finding studies, but not in the Phase III studies. Donepezil is not prescribed at less than 5 mg/day and therefore meta-analyses were not carried out for the treatment groups where dose was less than 5 mg/day. </P>
<P>Meta-analyses on the ITT population, where LOCF assessments were incorporated when assessments were missing, and on the completers' population are reported where data are available. The results appear similar, suggesting no differential drop-out between the treatment groups. Models were fitted using fixed effects. There is evidence of heterogeneity between the studies for a few meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The rating scales and cognitive tests differ in the direction representing improvement, or fewer symptoms . A decrease in score indicates improvement with the ADAS-Cog, CIBIC-Plus, GBS, CDR and ADL, whereas increase shows improvement for the MMSE, SIB, QoL and PDS. </P>
<P>
<B>Global assessment</B>
<BR/>The 7-point CIBIC-Plus scale, measuring global clinical state, was dichotomized, counting those showing no change or decline, against those showing improvement, and analysed using the Peto odds ratio. There are benefits associated with 5 and 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo at 12 and 24 weeks as shown by the ITT-LOC analyses.</P>

<P>The GBS and MENFIS are both global assessment scales. Only two studies used these scales, the <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> used the GBS and the Japanese studies used the MENFIS. There is some evidence of benefit associated with donepezil (completers).<BR/> 5 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (MD -2.56, 95%CI -4.27 to -0.85, P = 0.003) (1 study)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 52 weeks (MD -6.01, 95%CI -11.93 to -0.09, P = 0.05) (1 study)</P>
<P>The CDR-SB, measuring both cognitive function and aspects of everyday functioning together in a single score was also analysed using weighted mean differences, and shows a benefit with 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil compared with placebo at 12 weeks, and 10 mg/day of donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks.

<B>
<BR/>Cognitive function</B>
<BR/>The meta-analysis reveals benefits associated with 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil compared with placebo on cognitive function as shown by improvement in the ADAS-Cog, MMSE (completers) and SIB (ITT-LOCF) test scores at 12 and 24 weeks. The meta-analyses of the data for the 5mg/day group include the two Japanese studies which used the ADAS-Jcog. There was no statistical heterogeneity in these meta-analyses. When the Japanese studies were omitted from the analyses there were no substantial changes in the results.<BR/>ADAS-cog<BR/>5 mg/day donepezil at 12 weeks (WMD -2.15, 95%CI -2.69 to -1.61, P = &lt;0.00001) (6 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 12 weeks (WMD -2.45, 95%CI -3.01 to -1.89, P = &lt;0.00001) (7 studies) <BR/>5 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (WMD -2.02, 95%CI -2.77 to -1.26, P = &lt;0.00001) (3 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (WMD -2.81, 95%CI -3.55 to -2.06, P = &lt;0.00001) (5 studies)<BR/>MMSE<BR/>5 mg/day donepezil at 12 weeks (WMD 1.08, 95%CI 0.61 to 1.54, P = &lt;0.00001) (3 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 12 weeks (WMD 1.26, 95%CI 0.90 to 1.62, P = &lt;0.00001) (6 studies) <BR/>5 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (WMD 1.44, 95%CI 0.64 to 2.24, P = 0.0004) (1 study)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (WMD 1.34, 95%CI 0.92 to 1.76, P = &lt;0.00001) (5 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 52 weeks (WMD 1.84, 95%CI 0.53 to 3.15, P = 0.006) (1 study)<BR/>SIB<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (WMD 5.55, 95%CI 3.60 to 7.49, P = &lt;0.00001) (3 studies)</P>

<B>Activities of daily living</B>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> was the only study to assess activities of daily living using the PDS scale. 10 mg/day donepezil showed benefit compared with placebo at 52 weeks (ITT-LOC analysis)<BR/>(MD 3.80, 95%CI 1.70 to 5.90, P = 0.0004) (1 study).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> used the ADCS-ADL-severe scale. There was evidence of benefit of donepezil.<BR/>10 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (MD 1.60, 95%CI 0.21 to 2.99, P = 0.02) (1 study)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> assessed the time spent each day by the carer assisting with the activities of daily living but there was no evidence of a treatment effect. 10 mg/day donepezil at 24 weeks (MD -52.4, 95%CI -118.78 to 13.98, P = 0.12) (Time spent (mins)/day by the carer assisting with IADL and PSMS)(ITT-LOCF) (1 study)</P>
<P>The primary endpoint of <LINK REF="STD-Study-312_x002f_314" TYPE="STUDY">Study 312/314</LINK> was time to clinically evident decline in function, as defined in the protocol. There was evidence of benefit of donepezil (10 mg/day) at 54 weeks.<BR/> (84/207 donepezil, 116/206 placebo) (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, P = 0.001) (1 study)</P>

<B>Behavioural disturbance</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-203" TYPE="STUDY">Study 203</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> assessed behavioural disturbance (NPI-TOTAL), and 10 mg/day donepezil showed benefit compared with placebo at 24 weeks (ITT-LOCF).<BR/>(MD -2.62, 95%CI -4.88 to -0.43, P = 0.02) (3 studies). It is noted that the result for <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK> is in the opposite direction showing a positive placebo effect compared with <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK>. It must be concluded that there is very little evidence for assessing behavioural disturbance.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life</B>
<BR/>There is no evidence of any benefit associated with donepezil in the patient rated Quality of Life scale at doses of either 10 or 5 mg/day compared with placebo at 12 or 24 weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>Carer stress</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK> assessed the stress on carers but the results have been reported without any measure of precision. <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2004</LINK> reported carer distress as measured using the NPI-D scale, but these were not considered reliable.</P>
<P>
<B>Health resource utilization and costs<BR/>
</B>This outcome is assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> studies. The studies were not pooled as the outcomes were not considered comparable across trials. Many items were assessed and reported separately, and total costs were reported. There were no significant differences between donepezil and placebo apart from total carer costs (counseling, visits to physician and medication) in favour of placebo (MD 31.0, 95% CI 7.22 to 54.78, P = 0.01) (one study).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects</B>
<BR/>Donepezil was judged to be fairly well tolerated. The meta-analyses of withdrawals before the end of treatment, using the Peto odds ratio, showed significant differences in withdrawals between the 5 mg/day group and the placebo group at 12 weeks but not 24 weeks, and for the 10 mg/day group at 12, 24 but not 52 weeks in favour of placebo . <BR/>(70/543 5 mg donepezil 40/536 placebo) (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.68, P = 0.003) (4 studies) (12 weeks)<BR/>(29/184 10 mg donepezil 13/178 placebo) (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.40, P = 0.01) (3 studies) (12 weeks)<BR/>(197/821 10 mg donepezil 157/792 placebo) (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, P = 0.05) (7 studies) (24 weeks).</P>
<P>Adverse events due to many causes were recorded. The meta-analyses of withdrawals before the end of treatment due to an adverse event, using the Peto odds ratio, show that there were significant differences between withdrawals from the 5 mg/day group in favour of placebo compared with the placebo group at 12 weeks but not at 24 weeks. There were significant differences for the 10 mg/day group in favour of placebo at 12 and 24 weeks, but not at 52 weeks.<BR/> 5 mg/day 12 weeks (17/260 donepezil, 47/253 placebo) (OR 2.33 95%CI 1.02 to 5.28, P = 0.04) (3 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day 12 weeks (16/184 donepezil, 4/178 placebo) (OR 3.45 95%CI 1.40 to 8.50, P = 0.007) (3 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day 24 weeks (114/807 donepezil, 72/778 placebo) (OR 1.60 95%CI 1.18 to 2.18, P = 0.003) (6 studies).</P>
<P>The meta-analyses of the total number of patients who suffered at least one adverse event showed significant differences between number suffering adverse events in the 5 mg/day group compared with the placebo group in favour of placebo at 24 weeks but not at 12 weeks. There were significant differences for the 10 mg/day group compared with placebo in favour of placebo at 24 weeks, but not at 12 or 52 weeks.<BR/>5 mg/day 24 weeks (267/407 donepezil, 240/405 placebo) (OR 1.43 95%CI 1.04 to 1.96, P = 0.03) (2 studies)<BR/>10 mg/day 24 weeks (520/650 donepezil, 464/616 placebo) (OR 1.51 95%CI 1.11 to 2.04, P = 0.008) (5 studies).</P>
<P>Forty five different causes of adverse event were reported in the trials. The causes of adverse events seen more frequently in the 10 mg/day dose group than in the 5 mg/day group or placebo group included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. These were mostly mild and transient, but occasionally moderately severe. There were significant differences, in favour of placebo, compared with donepezil, usually the 10 mg/day dose, for several causes of adverse events. <BR/>Anorexia 5 mg/day 24 weeks (16/561 compared with 7/567) (OR 2.25 95%CI 0.99 to 5.13, P = 0.05) (3 studies)<BR/>Anorexia 10 mg/day 24 weeks (41/533 compared with 10/541) (OR 3.64 95%CI 2.07 to 6.38, P = &lt;0.00001) (3 studies)<BR/>Asthenia 10 mg/day 24 weeks (36/343 compared with 17/308) (OR 2.01 95%CI 1.14 to 3.54, P = 0.02) (3 studies)<BR/>Cold syndrome 5 mg/day 24 weeks (10/136 compared with 2/131) (OR 3.87 95%CI 1.22 to 12.28, P = 0.02) (1 study)<BR/>Diarrhoea 5 mg/day 12 weeks (14/197 compared with 5/193) (OR 2.64 95%CI 1.05 to 6.63, P = 0.04) (2 studies)<BR/>Diarrhoea 10 mg/day 12 weeks (21/158 compared with 4/153) (OR 4.22 95%CI 1.87 to 9.54, P = 0.0005) (1 study)<BR/>Diarrhoea 5 mg/day 24 weeks (47/561 compared with 26/567) (OR 1.89 95%CI 1.18 to 3.04, P = 0.009) (3 studies)<BR/>Diarrhoea 10 mg/day 24 weeks (161/1077 compared with 456/1031) (OR 2.78 95%CI 2.10 to 3.69, P = &lt;0.00001) (7 studies)<BR/>Dizziness 10 mg/day 24 weeks (63/773 compared with 36/744) (OR 1.73 95%CI 1.15 to 2.61, P = 0.008) (5 studies)<BR/>Fatigue 10 mg/day 12 weeks (12/157 compared with 3/162) (OR 3.63 95%CI 1.29 to 10.21, P = 0.01)(1 study)<BR/>Hallucinations 10 mg/day 24 weeks (8/128 compared with 1/120) (OR 4.68 95%CI 1.24 to 17.66, P = 0.002) (1 study)<BR/>Insomnia 10 mg/day 12 weeks (28/158 compared with 8/153) (OR 3.38 95%CI 1.69 to 6.76, P = 0.0006) (1 study)<BR/>Insomnia 10 mg/day 24 weeks (39/546 compared with 15/497) (OR 2.40 95%CI 1.38 to 4.15, P = 0.002) (3 studies)<BR/>Muscle cramp 5 mg/day 24 weeks (9/154 compared with 1/162) (OR 5.48 95%CI 1.56 to 19.27, P = 0.008) (1 study)\Muscle cramp 10 mg/day 24 weeks (12/157 compared with 1/162) (OR 6.00 95%CI 1.98 to 18.18, P = 0.002) (1 study)<BR/>Nausea 10 mg/day 12 weeks (34/158 compared with 12/153) (OR 2.95 95%CI 1.58 to 5.51, P = 0.0007) (1 study)<BR/>Nausea 10 mg/day 24 weeks (142/1053 compared with 45/1002) (OR 3.09 95%CI 2.28 to 4.19, P = &lt;0.00001) (7 studies)<BR/>Peripheral oedema 10 mg/day 24 weeks (25/103 compared with 14/105) (OR 2.04 95%CI 1.02 to 4.09, P = 0.04) (1 study)<BR/>Tremor 10 mg/day 24 weeks (8/103 compared with 2/105) (OR 3.58 95%CI 1.01 to 12.71, P = 0.05) (1 study)<BR/>Vertigo 10 mg/day 52 weeks (11/142 compared with 3/144) (OR 3.36 95%CI 1.15 to 9.82, P = 0.03) (1 study)<BR/>Vomiting 10 mg/day 24 weeks (84/677 compared with 32/687) (OR 2.73 95%CI 1.86 to 4.00, P = &lt;0.00001) (4 studies)<BR/>Weight loss 10 mg/day 24 weeks (30/247 compared with 16/251) (OR 2.02 95%CI 1.09 to 3.73, P = 0.02) (2 studies)</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2004</LINK> reported the number of adverse events in 26 weeks of treatment when patients already taking 10 mg/day of donepezil were randomized to either placebo or a further 5 or 10 mg/day of donepezil. There was no significant difference between treatment and placebo (that is between 15-20 mg/day and 10 mg/day). Cognitive function was not assessed.</P>
<P>CONCLUSIONS<BR/>The results of 14 trials demonstrate beneficial effect of donepezil compared with placebo on cognitive function and measures of global clinical state at 12, 24 and 52 weeks. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for those with severe dementia. The evidence that the size of the effect is dose-related, being greater for 10 mg/day than for 5 mg/day of donepezil is slight. The adverse effects are significantly greater with the 10 mg/day than with the 5 mg/day dose. The more recent studies do not test the lower dose, and evidence is available only in the older phase III studies.</P>
<P>There are fewer data on measures of behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living, but there is evidence of benefit of donepezil in these domains, mostly for the 10 mg/day dose. There is no evidence of an effect on the patient rated Quality of Life, although the scale used is unvalidated for people with dementia.</P>
<P>There is little evidence of a difference in the cost of health resource utilization between the donepezil and placebo groups. Two studies reported on costs accruing during the randomized treatment for patients, the first over six months in 1998 in Australia, France and Canada, (in the ratio 25:10:65) and the other over one year in 1999 in Northern Europe, mostly Finland and Sweden, with smaller groups in Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. The costs covered the utilization of healthcare resources by the patient and carer and the cost of unpaid carer time. The results are specific to the countries in which the studies were undertaken because of differences between the public health systems. The detailed reports show very different apportionment of costs between different items in different countries. The final conclusion is that there was no benefit or disadvantage of donepezil. This result applies to a population mix from several countries, which makes interpretation less than straightforward.<BR/>It is possible to draw conclusions that may be applicable to other populations. From both studies the major components of cost were due to residential care and home help. The estimate of the cost of unpaid carer time was also a very large component, but an item that may be disregarded in cost analyses undertaken to calculate the cost to the public purse. The absolute size of the costs will depend on the year the study was undertaken. The results apply to a population of patients with mild to moderate AD who were followed for a maximum time of one year.</P>
<P>When treatment is longer than 12 weeks there is no evidence of any difference in the numbers leaving the trials between the donepezil and placebo groups. The percentage leaving the trials increases with time, rising from about 20% at 24 weeks to 33% at 54 weeks. There is evidence that more participants leave donepezil treatment groups on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups. The numbers withdrawing are much higher for <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK>, but this trial is a special case, with many withdrawing to open label treatment which became available on the NHS. </P>
<P>There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the donepezil groups than in placebo. Although many causes of adverse event were reported, gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the donepezil groups than in placebo. The highest frequencies were in the donepezil 10 mg/day groups.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In evaluating evidence about any treatment, there are three key issues: the treatment, the type of patients it has been applied to, and the outcome. In terms of groups of patients, the available studies were carried out on carefully diagnosed patients mostly with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The severity of disease is defined using cognitive tests (Mini Mental State Examination) with subjects scoring above 17 regarded as mild and those scoring in the 17 to 10 range as moderate, although these limits have changed over time. There are four trials of patients with more severe dementia, <LINK REF="STD-Winblad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winblad 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-315" TYPE="STUDY">Study 315</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-311" TYPE="STUDY">Study 311</LINK>, the nursing home study and <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 2000</LINK>. The mean MMSE of these studies are 6, 7.5, 14 and 11 respectively, compared with a mean MMSE in the range 17-24 for the other studies. As mentioned, many patients with co-existing illness or concurrent treatment were excluded from the trials. The study groups may therefore be healthier than patients typically seen in clinical practice. The two studies with less stringent inclusion criteria added little to the meta-analyses, there were no data available from <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 2000</LINK>, the general practice study, and the results from <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK> proved difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>The treatment, use of donepezil in doses up to 10 mg/day once daily, is straightforward. Except for the <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic Study</LINK> in which patients were treated for 52 weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-AD2000" TYPE="STUDY">AD2000</LINK>, which had a long treatment duration but with severely depleted numbers of patients (52% had dropped out by 1 year), the available trials are limited to 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. As Alzheimer's disease generally progresses slowly and a clinical course of 5 or 10 years is not unusual, this duration of treatment is relatively short. Unfortunately, randomized trial evidence of longer term effects is not currently available and given the widely differing rates of progression of Alzheimer's disease in different individuals and groups selected in different ways, extrapolation could be misleading. There are reports of open-label extensions to some of the included studies. Generally the patients who complete the randomized phase were eligible for entry to the open-label phase. All patients began on a low dose for several weeks and progressed to 10 mg/day if this dose were tolerated. It has been reported that patients maintained their level of performance at better than baseline for more than 40 weeks, and that there was no reduction in treatment effect for up to two years (<LINK REF="STD-Study-202" TYPE="STUDY">Study 202</LINK>). It is of great interest to see that patients are still doing well after more than two years on donepezil, although the results are likely to be biased. There are several reasons for possible bias; not all patients (only about 80%) enter the extensions to the trials, the comparisons are made with historical controls, and patients drop out at a much faster rate than from the original randomized trial. It has been reported that 92% experienced at least one adverse event, mostly associated with the nervous or digestive systems. About 28% experienced a serious adverse event, but less than 1% of these were considered as possibly related to treatment (Doody 2001). <LINK REF="STD-Geldmacher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Geldmacher 2003</LINK> reported that as a result of analysing data on nursing home placement from the open label extension studies, donepezil is associated with a significant delay before institutionalization. There followed considerable critical correspondence pointing out the many ways in which <LINK REF="STD-Geldmacher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Geldmacher 2003</LINK> results could be biased. The patients were divided into four groups for comparisons, based not on randomization but on the treatment they had received in the randomized trial, their compliance in that trial, and the length of time spent in the open-label follow up trial. All comparisons were made against a so-called placebo group consisting of those who had received less than 5 mg/day in the randomized trial, or who had not completed the trial, and who did not enter the further open label study, or who left this phase early. This group is unlikely to be comparable to the treated group. The accusations that the results from the analysis are biased are well founded. The results of open-label extension trials must be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In terms of measuring outcomes and statistical analysis, the donepezil trials have essentially followed the relevant US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. The results reported are on an intention-to-treat basis (ITT), based on the subjects' last assessments during the double-blind phase (so-called Last Observation Carried Forward LOCF analysis). As patients who did not complete the trial would, on average, show a further decline by the end of the double-blind phase, this substitution of the LOCF is likely to enhance the final outcome. This effect is of significance when large numbers drop out and when there is differential drop-out across the treatment groups. In these trials the latter effect applies to the 10 mg/day donepezil group, where there is a slightly greater drop-out rate compared with placebo (27% compared with 21%), which is probably related to treatment. However, we report the results from the analysis of the ITT and completers' data, and find that the loss of patients from the trials does not alter our conclusions.</P>
<P>Measuring the effects of interventions in Alzheimer's disease is far from easy. The reported trials provide evidence that donepezil improves cognitive function of patients with mild or moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 and 24 weeks with 5 or 10 mg/day. The two cognitive tests used in the trials for mild to moderate dementia, primary outcome ADAS-Cog (range 0-70) and the secondary outcome MMSE (range 0-30) assess similar domains and a high correlation between the results would be expected. The 10 mg/day treatment group showed an improvement at 12 weeks (2.5 points on ADAS-Cog, 1.3 points on MMSE), at 24 weeks (2.9 points on ADAS-Cog, 1.5 points on MMSE) and at 52 weeks (1.8 points on the MMSE) compared with placebo.</P>
<P>One problem with the cognitive tests is whether what they measure is of everyday importance. The US FDA therefore required an independent clinician to assess global clinical state after seeing the patients and caregiver at baseline and follow-up. The resulting CIBIC-Plus scores clearly show an impact on global clinical state. The trials do provide evidence that donepezil improves the global clinical state of patients with mild or moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 and 24 weeks with 5 and 10 mg/day. The frequency distributions of these ratings have been published for the two phase II studies in the US prescribing leaflet, and suggest that most of the benefit of donepezil was scored in the no change or 'minimal' improvement range of the scale. Nevertheless stabilization or small improvement on a relatively insensitive scale may represent a more important real-life benefit; only clinical experience can really answer this point. Establishing whether some patients benefited more substantially from treatment would require analysis of individual data, taking appropriate account of the improvements seen also in some placebo patients. </P>
<P>With donepezil at a dose of 5 and 10 mg/day, there were changes in the scores from the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) at 24 weeks compared with placebo. However, one half of the CDR-SB score measures cognition and the other half community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. The CDR-SB result could therefore reflect the same function changes as are evident from the cognitive tests; without disaggregated data it is not possible to quantify any improvement in behaviour or function. There is very little evidence on the effect of donepezil on behavioural problems which were assessed in only three studies. The results from one study were considered unreliable, and the treatment effects from the other two were in opposite directions. In none of the studies did the patients suffer from more than mild problems at baseline. No evidence was found that donepezil affects the patient-rated Quality of Life measured on the single crude scale chosen for these studies. <LINK REF="STD-ARIAL" TYPE="STUDY">ARIAL</LINK> assessed the stress on carers but the results have been reported without any measure of precision and are not included in this review.</P>
<P>Donepezil appears to have a low incidence of serious side effects. A short titration period of one week on 5 mg/day was used before proceeding to the 10 mg/day dose in the earlier studies (<LINK REF="STD-Study-301_x002f_303" TYPE="STUDY">Study 301/303</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Study-302" TYPE="STUDY">Study 302</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-304" TYPE="STUDY">Study 304</LINK>) but later studies use a four-week titration period as recommended by the pharmaceutical company in the prescribing information. There were significantly more total drop-outs and drop-outs due to adverse events from the 10 mg/day group than from the placebo or 5 mg/day groups, and therefore side-effects remain a clinical issue.</P>
<P>Two studies reported on costs accruing during the randomized treatment for patients, the first over six months in 1998 in Australia, France and Canada, (in the ratio 25:10:65) and the other over one year in 1999 in Northern Europe, mostly Finland and Sweden, with smaller groups in Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. The costs covered the utilization of healthcare resources by the patient and carer and the cost of unpaid carer time. The results are specific to the countries in which the studies were undertaken because of differences between the public health systems. The detailed reports show very different apportionment of costs between different items in different countries. The final conclusion is that there was no benefit or disadvantage of donepezil. This result applies to a population mix from several countries, which makes interpretation less than straightforward.<BR/>It is possible to draw conclusions that may be applicable to other populations. From both studies the major components of cost were due to residential care and home help. The estimate of the cost of unpaid carer time was also a very large component, an item that may be disregarded in cost analyses undertaken to calculate the cost to the public purse. The absolute size of the costs will depend on the year the study was undertaken. The results apply to a population of patients with mild to moderate AD who were followed for a maximum time of one year.</P>
<P>In the 2006 update two 6 month trials of patients with severe dementia are included. Patients were included with a MMSE less than 12. These patients were excluded from most of the other included studies. The outcomes were cognition, activities of daily living, clinician's impression of global change and adverse events. When these results are added to the meta-analyses the results appear very similar to those of patients with mild to moderate dementia; there appears nothing to distinguish them. Although the MMSE measurements are in a different part of the MMSE scale the treatment effect is very similar to the other trials. The Severe Impairment Battery was also used to assess cognitive function, a scale designed for use with severely demented patients. There is no evidence of a different rate of withdrawals from the trial, or of rates of adverse events. The death rate is higher, but this reflects the greater age of the people in the severe stage of dementia comapred with the milder stages. There is no difference between the death rates for the treatment and placebo groups.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12, 24 and 52 weeks, donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day produced improvements in cognitive function, measuring -2.9 points as a weighted mean (CI -3.6 to -2.2), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were only marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Important emerging issues are the economic effectiveness of the cholinesterase inhibitors. It would be helpful to see long-term randomized trials of treatments that examine real world economic outcomes such as cost of care and the need for institutionalization. Unfortunately, given the proven clinical efficacy of donepezil it is hard to see how long-term, placebo-controlled randomized trials with economic primary outcomes could now be ethically undertaken.</P>
<P>Further important issues are duration of treatment, the severity of dementia and the effects of withdrawal at the end of the treatment period. As this review has evolved the evidence of effectiveness of treatment has now been extended to 52 weeks, but effectiveness for some patients may not end at this point. Randomized trials of treatment involving the use of placebos over many years are unlikely to be either a practical or ethical option. Other robust trial designs will be needed to help establish the maximum duration of treatment, and the indicators that treatment is no longer beneficial. There is no evidence to suggest that the effects of donepezil are any less for those with severe dementia.</P>

<TITLE>Review does not answer carer's questions</TITLE>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>A carer found this review did not answer many of her questions.</P>
<P>"As carer for someone with Alzheimers who is taking Aricept, this review did not answer many of my questions.For example, the description of participants uses language I do not understand. What do all the initials mean (ICD-10, DSM and NINCDS-ADRDA), and how do these criteria relate to someone with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers?<BR/>Top of the list of outcomes in the methods section is 'dependency (institutionalisation)'. I agree this is an important outcome, and was therefore disappointed to find no further reference to this it in the results and discussion. Also, whether a person with Alzheimers can continue to live independently will depend to a considerable extent on the level of support provided by carers. It would be good to see a range of measures of dependency, including on carers, as outcomes. This issue is closely related to quality of life, both for the patient and the carer. For example, ability to shop and cook, clean, pay bills, maintain contact with friends and family, and to get out and about.</P>
<P>It is also hard to understand what many of the other listed outcomes mean for someone with Alzheimers. For example, what do 'global impression', 'functional performance', 'cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests)' mean, and how do you plan to assess quality of life for both the person and their carer?</P>
<P>Much of the data in the review relates to scales with unpronounceable acronyms that I do not understand. What do these scales mean in terms of the important things in day to day life? What does worsening therefore mean in terms of loss of useful function?"</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The main reviewer (J. Birks) replied:</P>
<P>We thank you for your comment on our review and are sorry that it did not answer many of the questions you have about treatment with donepezil.</P>
<P>The acronyms that you refer to (ICD-10, DSM and NINCDS-ADRDA) are those of diagnostic criteria. DSM refers to the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'. NINCDS-ADRDA refers to the 'National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association'. ICD-10 refers to World Health Organisation classification of mental and behavioural disorders, the clinical description and diagnostic guidelines. References to these criteria are given in the review. The use of validated criteria such as these not only increases the accuracy of diagnosis but ensures standardisation between clinicians.</P>
<P>We agree that dependency is an important outcome and it was included in the protocol as an outcome of interest. Unfortunately none of the clinical trials of donepezil included in the review assessed this outcome and therefore there were no results on dependency.</P>
<P>The outcomes of the clinical trials are measured using validated cognitive tests and rating scales. Validation refers to the process of testing and subsequent publication of the results of the testing that a scale has to undergo before it is considered suitable to use in assessment. The publication will set out the exact method of applying and scoring the scale, together with the questionnaire if applicable. References to the scales that are used in the clinical trials included in the donepezil review are given, together with a short description of the scale within the methods section of the review. Some of these scales do attempt to measure the ability to carry out everyday activities.</P>
<P>In future we intend to bring together information on diagnostic criteria and rating scales on our website so that it is easily accessible.</P>
<P>REPLY LELIA DUDLEY TO JACQUELINE BIRKS:<BR/>I do not think the response addresses my main questions, which were how do these criteria relate to someone with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers? And what do the outcomes reported mean to patients and their carers? Finally, within a systematic review, if dependancy was identified as one of the main outcomes at the protocol stage, the lack of data makes it even more important that this lack is highlighted and taken account off in the discussion. </P>
<P>REPLY JACQUELINE BIRKS TO LELIA DUDLEY<BR/>The diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS-ADRDA) require formal mental status testing, a medical history, physical neurological and psychiatric examination, laboratory tests and a scan. It would not be possible to include a lot of detail concerning the diagnostic criteria (DSM and NINCDS-ADRDA) in every review, but we are intending to put this information, together with detailed description of the commonly used rating scales and cognitive tests, on our website for those who are interested. This should also help readers assess the results from the clinical trials.</P>
<P>Dependency was not measured in any included trial, although some aspects of dependency are covered by rating scales that assess activities of daily living. It was listed under outcomes because we would have been interested in it if it were measured. If we had some measures of dependency and some data we would then be in a better position to discuss and comment on this outcome, but at the present time we have decided that we are not in a position to comment.</P>
