<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-17 15:14:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Keyhole surgery, which involves a surgeon making several smaller cuts to obtain a healthy kidney for transplanting, was compared with the traditional technique of making a single larger cut (open surgery). Six studies randomising 596 healthy kidney donors to either keyhole or open surgery, found keyhole surgery to be associated with less pain for the donor but had similar numbers of complications that can require further treatment or surgery or both. Donor kidneys that were obtained using the keyhole surgical technique were deprived of nutrients for longer periods of time than kidneys obtained for transplant using open surgery, but this does not appear to have any short-term consequences.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-17 15:16:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Six studies were identified that randomised 596 live kidney donors to either LDN or ODN arms. All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, allocation bias, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting bias. Four of six studies had high risk of bias for blinding. Various different combinations of techniques were used in each study, resulting in heterogeneity in the results. The conversion rate from LDN to ODN ranged from 1% to 1.8%. LDN was generally found to be associated with reduced analgesia use, shorter hospital stay, and faster return to normal physical functioning. The extracted kidney was exposed to longer warm ischaemia periods (2 to 17 minutes) with no associated short-term consequences. ODN was associated with shorter duration of procedure. For those outcomes that could be meta-analysed there were no significant differences between LDN or ODN for perioperative complications (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.59), reoperations (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.64), early graft loss (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.48), delayed graft function (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30), acute rejection (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 0.87 to 2.27), ureteric complications (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.31), kidney function at one year (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.41) or graft loss at one year (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.85).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-26 16:02:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>LDN is associated with less pain compared with open surgery; however, there are equivalent numbers of complications and occurrences of perioperative events that require further intervention. Kidneys obtained using LDN procedures were exposed to longer warm ischaemia periods than ODN-acquired grafts, although this has not been reported as being associated with short-term consequences.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-22 11:27:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Kidney transplantation remains the treatment of choice for people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). There is now good evidence that transplantation improves both the quality and quantity of life in recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1999</LINK>) when compared with dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Salazar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salazar 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Living organ donation has the potential to increase numbers of transplants compared with other strategies, such as the use of marginal organs from cadaveric donors. Kidneys from live donors, compared with cadaveric donors (<LINK REF="REF-UNOS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 1996</LINK>), have been found to increase recipients' life expectancy and reduce requirement for retransplantation. Other major advantages of live kidney donation include superior recipient post-transplant outcomes (less delayed graft function and greater one year graft survival), potential for transplantation before dialysis is commenced, and opportunity to plan the procedure to optimise recipient condition (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Live donor nephrectomy is conventionally performed through an open flank incision with or without rib resection. Major disincentives for people contemplating becoming live kidney donors are the pain, scarring, and morbidity associated with large flank incision (<LINK REF="REF-Cecka-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cecka 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1997</LINK>). This method of open donor nephrectomy (ODN) has been challenged by less invasive surgical techniques that use mini incisions or anterior transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2002</LINK>). Most recently, laparoscopic equipment has been used to reduce incision sizes still further.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1995</LINK> first performed laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) in 1995. Since then, considerable numbers of transplant centres worldwide have adopted LDN. Smaller incision sizes have stimulated publication of many case reports of reductions in postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, improved cosmesis, and earlier return to work (<LINK REF="REF-Fabrizio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabrizio 1999</LINK>). The secondary potential societal benefits of LDN have been in improved donation experience, and increasing the number of living kidney donors who present for assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Giessieng-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giessieng 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Balanced against any prospective gain in numbers of transplants is the overriding concern of donor safety. Advocates of ODN have raised a number of concerns over the laparoscopic technique including an increased use of left kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Dols-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dols 2009</LINK>) (because of technical difficulties with access to the right side); major complications such as pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and splenic lacerations; and minor complications such as pneumothorax, liver lacerations and diaphragmatic injuries, as reported by the University of Maryland series (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three studies were excluded from the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bargman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bargman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guleria-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hofker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofker 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bargman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bargman 2006</LINK> was excluded as per our protocol because there was no control open arm (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). After considerable discussion, two further studies were excluded despite purporting to be RCTs that compared open and laparoscopic techniques. <LINK REF="STD-Hofker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofker 2007</LINK>, published only in abstract form, compared a "minimal access retroperitoneal" technique with hand-assisted transperitoneal nephrectomy. Although the study was reported as randomised and double blind, no statistics were available, and our attempts to contact the authors for details and clarification were unsuccessful. Therefore, we decided to exclude the study from this analysis, pending availability of further information, which would be evaluated for possible inclusion in a review update. <LINK REF="STD-Guleria-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 2010</LINK> was excluded on the basis of a randomisation technique that we found was open to considerable bias, and because further details on selection of patients for LDN and ODN were not reported or gleaned during correspondence with the lead author (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

Another study reported a non significant reduction in visual analogue pain scale scores (<LINK REF="STD-Basiri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Basiri 2007</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of procedure and blood loss</HEADING>
<P>Unsurprisingly, all of the laparoscopic procedures, whether hand-assisted or laparoscopic, took longer than open surgery. Surgery times ranged from an average of two to three hours for ODN to three to four hours for LDN. Blood loss varied widely; most patients had minimal blood loss, but a few experienced moderate intraoperative blood loss. Hence, most studies reported medians and ranges. Arterial haemorrhage from dislodged clips or inadvertent injury resulted in a number of transfusions being required (compared with complications). Overall, there were no significant differences in blood loss and operating time between hand-assisted (<LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2001</LINK>; average 206 minutes and blood loss 156 mL) and fully laparoscopic (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2010</LINK>; average 160 minutes and blood loss 200 mL) procedures. Similarly, there appeared to be minimal differences between flank and mini incision approaches (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was a large number of visceral injuries, bleeding episodes and reoperations in the LDN groups. <LINK REF="STD-Oyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oyen 2005</LINK> reported needing to reoperate or convert nearly 10% of laparoscopic procedures because of complications. In response, the surgeons restricted donors being offered LDN to people with low BMI (range not stated). Overall, 3/5 studies converted laparoscopic procedures to open approaches because of intraoperative difficulty or complications (range 0 to 1.8%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> (5 studies, 596 participants): RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.64; I = 26%) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-25 01:31:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The perioperative death rate for donor nephrectomy has been quantified as being in the range of 0.03% to 0.06% (<LINK REF="REF-British-Transplantation-Society-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Transplantation Society 2005</LINK>). Most of these deaths occurred in the postoperative period and were related to cardiovascular and respiratory complications. Intraoperative complications, such as equipment failures that lead to catastrophic haemorrhage, were reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hsi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsi 2009</LINK>). Publications that identify and report such complications are few in the world literature, and there is little doubt that this statistic is underreported. A recent review from India identified nine deaths that were "directly attributable to the technique of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy"; however, the authors did not offer a denominator for this numerator (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 2010</LINK>). Unsurprisingly, no deaths were reported in the relatively small number of participants (596 donors) randomised in the six RCTs reported in this review, and we cannot comment on the relative risk associated with LDN.</P>
<P>Since Ratner's first description of laparoscopic kidney donation in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1995</LINK>), significant numbers of publications have tackled issues around LDN including increased ureteric complications, the technical difficulties associated with right-sided procedures, multiple vessels, and obesity. To a greater or lesser extent, all of these issues have been been addressed by increasing experience. A recent review highlighted the universality of LDN for potential kidney donors who are considered fit for the procedure on standard published criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Dols-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dols 2009</LINK>). Current interest centres around the type of approach, with a number of authors reporting excellent outcomes using the retroperitoneal technique (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yashi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yashi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ye-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the reported studies used the retroperitoneal approach, and in the absence of evidence, cannot therefore be recommended. Several reported reoperations (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oyen 2005</LINK>) were for peritoneal complications, such as adhesions and serosal tears which may have been avoided by such an approach. However, as suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2010</LINK> in their discussion, the peritoneum is a thin barrier and thermal injury to the bowel must remain a consideration.</P>
<P>There can be little doubt that potential donors are deterred by the pain and scar associated with the traditional flank incision (<LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1997</LINK>), and hence the current climate of donor shortage has stimulated interest in LDN. It could be assumed that hand-assisted techniques may be be easier to teach and learn, and offer a better safety profile because of the sensitivity associated with tactile feedback and enhanced ability to control unexpected haemorrhage. Indeed, in the reported studies all conversions to open surgery were from pure laparoscopic procedures. In the hand-assisted approach, ports are approximately 8 cm in length - the size of the incision is partly dictated by the opening required to extract the graft. The incision can be placed either transperitoneally or retroperitoneally. Certainly, for surgeons who do not perform laparoscopic nephrectomy regularly, the benefits of laparoscopy without the harms of rapid conversion are self evident. None of the presented statistical analyses showed any difference between hand-assistance and full laparoscopic approaches. A small RCT that compared the techniques showed no difference in outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Bargman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bargman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The range of warm ischaemia time experienced by the kidney was longer with laparoscopic techniques (deleted up to 20 minutes). Considering the speed of extraction in ODN, this time period is considerably longer than LDN and may have associations with long-term consequences that have not yet been identified. If sequelae are found to be associated with longer periods of warm ischaemia time, it is probable that it could take several years to accumulate evidence and research interventions. Evidence relating to reduced long-term survival rates following kidney transplants from non-heart beating donors or donors after cardiac death in the 1990s has only recently become apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2009</LINK>). These donated kidneys are exposed to the agonal phase of death, as well as long periods of warm and cold ischaemia, so we hesitate to draw direct conclusions from this specific situation to live donor derived grafts.</P>
<P>All reported surgeries in these studies were conducted early in the learning experience of participating surgeons. Although the wide range of reported complications (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) could be expected among surgeons who are building skills in specific, specialised techniques, such as those who participated in the studies, a number of complications could be considered unacceptable in the context of the donation situation. The Rikshospitalet group (Oslo, Norway; <LINK REF="STD-Oyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oyen 2005</LINK>) reported a high number of conversions and reoperations that were associated with considerable morbidity. This finding stimulated making a number of changes to the program, and subsequently, the same Norwegian team (<LINK REF="REF-Mjoen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjoen 2009</LINK>) reported on 244 LDN procedures with 3 conversions (1.2%) and a major complication rate of 4.1%.</P>
<P>Only one study reported on the costs of LDN (compare with results). All LDN procedures require financial outlay in technical equipment, but the hand-assisted procedure was the most expensive of the laparoscopic procedures; a single Pneumo-sleeve device was reported to cost around 500 USD per use (<LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2001</LINK>). The cost benefits of LDN were difficult to quantify but could be qualified at the societal level. Societal benefits of LDN were found to include fewer patients on dialysis waiting lists, reduced hospital stays and more donors able to return to work quicker. A recent publication has suggested a hospital cost comparison of 55,292 USD for LDN versus 29,886 USD for ODN (<LINK REF="REF-Hamidi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamidi 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laparoscopic kidney donation, compared with open surgical techniques, was found to be associated with less pain and shorter hospital stays, but equivalent numbers of complications and perioperative events that require further intervention. The extracted kidney is exposed to longer warm ischaemia periods, although this was not found to be associated with short-term consequences (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<I>High risk of bias: </I>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
