Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 13 studies.</P><P><B>Key messages</B><BR/>There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of a specific type of electronic or optical reading aid. The review suggests that reading speeds improve with the use of stand-mounted electronic devices. There is little evidence for a difference between head-mounted or portable electronic devices versus optical or other electronic devices, although technology may have improved since these studies took place. There is no evidence to support the use of filters or prism spectacles.</P><P><B>What was studied in the review?</B><BR/>The number of people with low vision is increasing with the ageing population. Magnifying optical and electronic aids are commonly prescribed to help people maintain the ability to read when their vision starts to fade. Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence for the effect of reading aids on reading ability in people with low vision to find out whether there are differences in reading performance using conventional optical devices, such as hand-held or stand-based microscopic magnifiers, as compared to electronic devices such as stand-based, closed circuit television and hand-held electronic magnifiers.</P><P>Cochrane Review authors assessed how certain the evidence was for each review finding. They looked for factors that can make the evidence less certain, such as problems with the way the studies were done, very small studies, and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that can make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty.</P><P><B>What are the main results of the review?</B><BR/>Cochrane Review authors found 13 relevant studies. Seven were from the USA, five from the UK and one from Canada. These studies compared the effect of different reading aids on reading performance, mainly reading speed. The participants were adults attending low vision services. Most of the people were affected by macular degeneration, which causes of loss of central vision and is often age-related. Because most of the studies were small, the results were often imprecise, and it is difficult to know whether they apply to everyone with low vision.</P><P>The results were as follows.</P><P>&#8226; Reading speed may be faster with electronic devices than with optical magnifiers (moderate- and low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Provision of a closed circuit television (CCTV) at an initial rehabilitation consultation may increase reading speeds compared with standard low-vision aids prescription alone (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Reading speed with head-mounted electronic devices showed inconsistent differences compared to optical devices (moderate or low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Reading speeds with a tablet computer compared with stand-mounted CCTV were similar (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Addition of an electronic portable device to a preferred optical device did not appear to increase reading speed (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Coloured filters were no better and possibly worse than a clear filter for reading speed (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Custom or standard prism spectacles did not appear to convey additional benefit compared with conventional reading spectacles for people with age-related macular degeneration (low-certainty evidence).</P><P><B>How up-to-date is this review?</B><BR/>Cochrane Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 17 January 2018.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-04-06 10:51:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-10 10:36:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The purpose of low-vision rehabilitation is to allow people to resume or to continue to perform daily living tasks, with reading being one of the most important.

The date of the search was 17 January 2018.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-04-06 09:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review includes randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared any device or aid used for reading to another device or aid in people aged 16 or over with low vision as defined by the study investigators. We did not compare low-vision aids with no low-vision aid since it is obviously not possible to measure reading speed, our primary outcome, in people that cannot read ordinary print. We considered reading aids that maximise the person's visual reading capacity, for example by increasing image magnification (optical and electronic magnifiers), augmenting text contrast (coloured filters) or trying to optimise the viewing angle or gaze position (such as prisms). We have not included studies investigating reading aids that allow reading through hearing, such as talking books or screen readers, or through touch, such as Braille-based devices and we did not consider rehabilitation strategies or complex low-vision interventions.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-03-02 11:23:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome of the review was reading speed in words per minute. Secondary outcomes included reading duration and acuity, ease and frequency of use, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. </P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-04-06 09:23:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 11 small studies with a cross-over design (435 people overall), one study with two parallel arms (37 participants) and one study with three parallel arms (243 participants). These studies took place in the USA (7 studies), the UK (5 studies) and Canada (1 study). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the most frequent cause of low vision, with 10 studies reporting 50% or more participants with the condition. Participants were aged 9 to 97 years in these studies, but most were older (the median average age across studies was 71 years). None of the studies were masked; otherwise we largely judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. All studies reported the primary outcome: results for reading speed. None of the studies measured or reported adverse outcomes.</P><P>Reading speed may be higher with stand-mounted closed circuit television (CCTV) than with optical devices (stand or hand magnifiers) (low-certainty evidence, 2 studies, 92 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that reading duration was longer with the electronic devices and that they were easier to use. Similar results were seen for electronic devices with the camera mounted in a 'mouse'. Mixed results were seen for head-mounted devices with one study of 70 participants finding a mouse-based head-mounted device to be better than an optical device and another study of 20 participants finding optical devices better (low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from three studies (93 participants) suggested no important differences in reading speed, acuity or ease of use between stand-mounted and head-mounted electronic devices. Similarly, low-certainty evidence from one study of 100 participants suggested no important differences between a 9.7'' tablet computer and stand-mounted CCTV in reading speed, with imprecise estimates (other outcomes not reported).</P><P>Low-certainty evidence showed little difference in reading speed in one study with 100 participants that added electronic portable devices to preferred optical devices. One parallel-arm study in 37 participants found low-certainty evidence of higher reading speed at one month if participants received a CCTV at the initial rehabilitation consultation instead of a standard low-vision aids prescription alone.</P><P>A parallel-arm study including 243 participants with AMD found no important differences in reading speed, reading acuity and quality of life between prism spectacles and conventional spectacles. One study in 10 people with AMD found that reading speed with several overlay coloured filters was no better and possibly worse than with a clear filter (low-certainty evidence, other outcomes not reported).</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:29:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of a specific type of electronic or optical device for the most common profiles of low-vision aid users. However, there is some evidence that stand-mounted electronic devices may improve reading speeds compared with optical devices. There is less evidence to support the use of head-mounted or portable electronic devices; however, the technology of electronic devices may have improved since the studies included in this review took place, and modern portable electronic devices have desirable properties such as flexible use of magnification. There is no good evidence to support the use of filters or prism spectacles. Future research should focus on assessing sustained long-term use of each device and the effect of different training programmes on its use, combined with investigation of which patient characteristics predict performance with different devices, including some of the more costly electronic devices.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-10 20:29:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-19 13:58:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-19 13:54:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is no single, globally accepted definition of low vision (also known as partial sight, visual impairment and subnormal vision). However, there is general consensus that low vision is an uncorrectable loss of vision that interferes with daily activities. Definitions normally incorporate an estimate of visual loss in terms of impairment (e.g. measuring visual acuity or visual fields), or in terms of disability (measuring the ability to perform a certain task). One such definition states that low vision is the inability to read a newspaper at a normal reading distance (40 cm) with best refractive correction (<LINK REF="REF-Legge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legge 1991</LINK>).</P><P>The World Health Organization (WHO) has established criteria for low vision that are used in the International Classification of Diseases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Low vision is defined as a best-corrected visual acuity worse than 0.5 logMAR (Snellen 6/18 or 20/60) but equal to or better than 1.3 logMAR (3/60 or 20/400) in the better eye, or visual field loss corresponding to less than 20° in the better eye with best possible correction. Blindness is defined as a best-corrected visual acuity worse than 1.3 logMAR or a visual field no greater than 10° around central fixation in the better eye with best possible correction. Visual impairment includes low vision as well as blindness. In the USA, legal blindness is defined as a visual acuity of 1.0 logMAR (6/60 or 20/200) or worse in the better eye.</P><P>Blindness is one of the most common disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2003</LINK>): an estimated 39 million people were blind a decade ago, i.e. at the time of the last accurate assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Pascolini-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascolini 2011</LINK>). Among people older than 40 years in the USA, 937,000 were blind in 2002. Prevalence of blindness in the developing world (where 90% of total world blindness exists) and for the developed world is expected to increase significantly during the next decades as the world's population ages.</P><P>Causes of blindness are associated with race and ethnicity in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>): age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause in white people, whereas cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes in Latinos and African Americans. Different treatable or preventable conditions are the most frequent causes of blindness in developing countries: infectious disease, nutritional causes, and especially cataract and refractive error (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascolini-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascolini 2011</LINK>).</P><P>In industrialised countries, low vision is found principally in people aged 75 years or older (<LINK REF="REF-Margrain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margrain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 1990</LINK>), and it has been ranked third (behind arthritis and heart disease) among conditions that cause people older than 70 years to need assistance in activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1999</LINK>). The ageing population, combined with the dramatic increase in visual impairment in the older age groups, explains the significant increase seen in the demand for low-vision services.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-19 13:57:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The purpose of low-vision rehabilitation is to allow the person to resume or to continue to perform daily living tasks. This is achieved by providing appropriate optical devices, environmental modifications and special training in the use of residual-vision and low-vision aids (<LINK REF="REF-Massof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massof 1998</LINK>). Without rehabilitation, people with decreased visual acuity often abandon reading and other tasks requiring detailed vision. For individuals with extensive loss of their visual field, orientation and mobility can become difficult.</P><P>For a person with low vision, reading is considered one of the most important tasks or goals to achieve (<LINK REF="REF-Leat-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leat 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shuttleworth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shuttleworth 1995</LINK>). People using low-vision aids have reported improvements in reading a specific letter size both during distance and near work, and they have found optical aids useful to perform tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Humphry-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humphry 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virtanen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virtanen 1991</LINK>). A low-vision aid (LVA) is any device that enables a person with low vision to improve visual performance.</P><P>Common optical LVAs include:<BR/></P><UL><LI>magnifiers &#8211; these sometimes have their own illumination and are either battery-powered or rechargeable from mains electricity. They may be hand-held or mounted on a stand or on spectacles;</LI><LI>telescopes &#8211; for work where the reading matter is distant, a telescope can be mounted on a spectacle frame. This gives a longer working distance, although less can be seen at one time because the field is necessarily restricted. Telescopes may also be hand-held.</LI></UL><P>Electronic aids include primarily closed circuit television and other readers incorporating a monitor or a liquid-crystal display (LCD) screen, which provide improved contrast and magnification.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-16 11:23:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Like many types of rehabilitation, low-vision rehabilitation includes heterogeneous interventions, which may have several components. Moreover, people who are prescribed a low-vision device usually receive training to use it. Several training techniques are employed, often using both office- and home-based exercises with the device for a few hours in different sessions. Overall, multidisciplinary services tend to provide modern rehabilitation services (<LINK REF="REF-Langelaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langelaan 2007</LINK>). Besides prescription of LVAs and training on their use, especially focused on reading tasks, services can provide psychological support, home environmental assessment, and &#8211; for people of working age &#8211; social worker support. Moreover, several types of professionals provide different types of follow-up either in low-vision clinics or at home.</P><P>As was intended, this review concentrates on reading aids that magnify text, sometimes also improving its contrast.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-19 13:58:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The most suitable device depends on the person's needs and the visual functioning they have. Rehabilitation should be tailored to correspond to the type of visual loss and may also be modified by the individual's choice or expectations or by more general cultural demands (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margrain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margrain 1999</LINK>). Besides the level of magnification, there are other factors that are important when choosing an optical device, such as ease of use and cosmetic appearance. Devices may be rejected if they have an unusual cosmetic appearance that calls attention to the person's disability.</P><P>Reading is an extremely complex visual task, which involves the integration of visual, cognitive and motor processes. In everyday reading, it is important for people to achieve their optimal reading rate (usually measured in words per minute), and, for people with low vision, a speed that is sufficient to complete the task within an acceptable amount of time. The effect of slow reading on comprehension is variable, as <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 1998</LINK> found that low reading speed decreases comprehension but <LINK REF="REF-Legge-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legge 1989</LINK> did not.</P><P>Given the availability of a wide range of aids from simple magnifiers to high-power video magnifiers, all of which have advantages and disadvantages, an assessment of their effects on reading would be very useful.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-22 16:29:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effects of different visual reading aids for adults with low vision. </P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-04-05 17:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-04-05 17:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES><P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-02-16 11:30:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included trials in participants aged 16 or over with low vision as defined by the study investigators.

We considered the following parameters: method of allocation to treatment; allocation concealment (selection bias); documentation of exclusions and completeness of follow-up (attrition bias); selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). We did not consider masking of participants, study personnel (performance bias) and outcome assessors (detection bias) since it is not possible with most LVAs. Moreover, masking is meaningless for some outcomes, such as participant's preference for each device. We graded each parameter of trial quality as being at low, high or unclear risk of bias. We contacted study authors for clarification on any item graded as unclear. Authors were not masked to any trial details during the assessment.</P><P>Evaluation of cross-over-like studies was an issue in this review. Assessing the performance of the same participant who tries different LVAs is a common study design used by researchers into low vision, which is also known as a 'within-person' design. This is an efficient design since we do not need to allow for all variations that occur between arms of parallel-group studies. In practice this means that, for the same number of participants, a cross-over design is likely to be more powerful. However, cross-over trials are not always appropriate. The most important consideration is whether the participants start the second period in a similar state as how they started the first period. If the characteristics of the participant have changed in some way by the time the second period starts, then the comparison of treatments is not fair, and there will be within-participant variation. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration's Open Learning Additional Module 2, (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2002</LINK>) and on Chapter 16 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>), we addressed the following questions for cross-over studies.</P><UL><LI>Is the condition of the participants chronic and stable?</LI><LI>Does the intervention provide temporary relief, and not permanent change?</LI><LI>Can the outcome be repeated in the second period if it occurs in the first?</LI><LI>Might the effect of the first intervention last into the second treatment period?</LI><LI>Does the trial go on long enough for the LVA to be properly used?</LI></UL><P>Assessment of randomisation procedures requires consideration of two components: sequence generation and allocation concealment. A discussion among the authors led to grading both components in cross-over-like studies included in this review as being at low risk of bias. In fact, in low-vision studies adopting a cross-over-like design in this review, all participants used all devices and the order of presentation was randomised. We judged it necessary to address two questions when rating the quality of randomisation and allocation in this type of study.</P><OL><LI>Does knowledge of the first LVA selected affect recruitment into the trial?</LI><LI>Does the order in which the LVAs are used affect the results?</LI></OL><P>Regarding question 1, the answer should be no, since knowing the order of LVA presentation in the study should not affect recruitment into studies testing all devices in the same session. As to question 2, we considered two additional items: first, period effect (whether the condition can change during subsequent phases of testing of each device), and second, carry-over effect or period-by-treatment interaction (whether the effect on performance of using a specific device affects the performance of the following device).</P></QUALITY_ASSESSMENT><EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2018-02-19 14:08:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We obtained the mean difference (MD) and its standard error (SE), referred to as 'SE(MD)', when continuous data were available.

It is unclear whether or not reading acuity, measured and defined according to MNREAD-like methods (<LINK REF="REF-Ahn-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahn 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ahn-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahn 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legge-1985a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legge 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legge 2007</LINK>), translates into the ability to read ordinary print size. This is largely related to the amount and range of magnification offered by each device compared to the person's needs and the type of reading task. Thus, the issue of whether or not to match by magnification arises, depending on the study question, which ultimately depends on the study objectives and main outcome measure. We extracted reading acuity data only if studies used MNREAD-like methods (i.e. adjusting by distance or magnification) but accepted other definitions if devices were matched by magnification. In fact, reading acuity is nested within the ability to read with each device. This is relevant, since unmatched studies may record a large difference in the proportion of participants who are able to read with each device, thus leading to missing data with group imbalance, which can make it difficult to analyse and interpret reading acuity data. Paired studies could avoid this problem by restricting the analysis to participants who are able to read with all tested devices.</P><P>We extracted data for <LINK REF="STD-Kleweno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kleweno 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK> provided the critical print size, which we used as a proxy for reading acuity because they are strictly related measures using the same scale, so differences between devices are expected to be similar.</P><P>In <LINK REF="STD-Culham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2004</LINK> it was unclear whether LVAs were matched by magnification, and the large differences found did not suggest so. <LINK REF="STD-Eperjesi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eperjesi 2004</LINK> compared filters, and we did not extract reading acuity data regarding these aids since they do not magnify text.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life</HEADING><P><LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> also used quality of life questionnaires (National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire, NEI-VFQ), a performance assessment (Melbourne Low Vision Activities of Daily Living Index, MLVAI) and a questionnaire assessing participant experience with the spectacles. <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2017</LINK> used the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire and Rasch analysis to compute person measures. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2017</LINK> conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using different psychometric tools, and we extracted data for the NV-VFQ-15 questionnaire, which was developed with near vision items of the VFQ-48 questionnaire, then we used it to compute perceived difficulty by means of Rasch analysis.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Reading duration</HEADING><P><LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stelmack-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmack 1991</LINK> measured reading duration, defined as the time the participant could read without visual discomfort, measured in minutes.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Preference for each device</HEADING><P><LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kleweno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kleweno 2001,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2003,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Spitzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Spitzberg 1995,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2017</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK> recorded participants' preference for each device after their use.

Masking might have been possible for outcome assessors measuring reading speed if the participants' voices had been recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Eperjesi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eperjesi 2004</LINK> used a tape recorder to measure reading speed and could have masked examiners but did not report doing so. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> did achieve masking, a parallel-arm trial comparing prismatic and standard glasses.</P></BLINDING><EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-19 14:26:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There was no loss to follow-up in these short-term studies, some of which seemed to have been performed in a single testing session, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2017</LINK>, where 6 out of 36 participants were lost to follow-up at one month.</P></EXCLUSIONS><SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2018-02-16 13:08:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Few studies reported reading acuity or provided extractable data (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

In research on reading aids, testing can take place in a single session. Learning effect, or conversely fatigue due to prolonged testing, may be forms of this type of bias, although these biases will work in opposite directions. Randomisation is expected to balance these effects across LVAs used in the study, although it is possible the performance of some devices could be affected more than others when the participant becomes tired after repeated testing, which can be referred to as 'period-by-treatment interaction'.<BR/>No studies provided details on the timing of testing sessions, particularly on time between longer reading duration tests. However, some provided details that were suggestive of little risk of carry-over effect. <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1999</LINK> could not find a practice effect comparing the first and the last half of their tests, nor a decay in performance, but a quantitative assessment was not available.

Reading speed and reading acuity have been outcomes of interest in early LVA research focusing on the reading performance obtained with each device. No studies have used validated measurement methods to investigate important secondary outcomes such as subjective preference for each device or sustained use.</P><P>Low-vision and reading rehabilitation is a complex intervention, and LVA users value aspects other than reading speed.

We acknowledge that our review is a partial investigation of the needs of people with low vision, and that another Cochrane Review currently underway will include studies using multidisciplinary or monodisciplinary rehabilitation for adults with low vision, with quality of life as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Langelaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langelaan 2007</LINK>).</P><P>Finally, we did not report on cost issues in this review, since these were not an outcome in the included studies. <LINK REF="REF-VA-HTA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">VA HTA 2003</LINK> observed that "sustained use of these devices in the subject's life setting, resources required in terms of costs and training associated with each alternative, and the link between device use and health related quality of life were unknown". This review also provided information on unit cost of devices in the Veteran Affairs reimbursement framework. Among excluded studies in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2006</LINK> compared the reading performance of low-cost and gold-standard magnifiers and found no difference between them. However, this study was available only as an abstract and there were insufficient data to include it.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Culham-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2009</LINK> is an example of a well-structured study investigating which performance aspects influence LVA user opinion, and may help us understand what users seek or reject in low-vision devices. The study investigators considered participants' assessment of several features of LVAs both before and after their home loan, as well as participants' willingness to pay for each device. In this study, image quality and magnification facilities were the most important factors determining overall subjective rating of the devices. They concluded that there is much to learn from listening to patients. They also commented that impressions may change with familiarity and environment, and a single clinical assessment may not provide an accurate evaluation of how useful a device might become with time. We could not include this study because our review is restricted to reading speed as the primary outcome measure, but we found that the methodology and research scope in <LINK REF="STD-Culham-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2009</LINK> are an important research field regarding LVAs.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2013</LINK> provides an extensive technical discussion on the methods for assessing reading performance. A broader perspective on outcome measures, including quality of life measures, in low vision service research is also available by <LINK REF="REF-Binns-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binns 2012</LINK>, who have conducted a systematic review on effectiveness of low vision service provision.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Problems with generalisability of results from systematic reviews of low-vision aids</HEADING><P>A further complication is that reading performance using electronic or optical devices might potentially be confounded by participant characteristics such as age, physical and mental health, and the type and severity of low vision. The type of task can also make a difference; tasks such as reading mail do not require long reading duration or a fast reading speed, while reading a magazine or a newspaper involves longer reading duration, and reading speed is more critical to complete the task. It is therefore important that authors of future studies provide details on these characteristics.</P><P>Another question is whether or not a participant's ability to use all of the LVAs under investigation should be an inclusion criterion for reading performance studies. In fact, reading speed as an outcome measure is nested in the ability to read. This methodological problem is similar to that of outcome-based subgroup analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Hirji-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirji 2009</LINK>. In studies testing several devices on the same participant, some may be able to read with one device but not with others if the devices do not provide the same magnification. As a result, a missing data problem with group imbalance may arise for reading acuity if many more participants are unable to read with a specific, usually low-magnification, device. Whether to match for appropriate magnification depends on the research question, particularly whether people with low vision use devices with optimal magnification (i.e. enabling them to read standard print size), and surveys may be more appropriate than randomised controlled trials to investigate this question.</P><P>Other questions include whether or not devices are cost-effective and effective in the long term.</P><P>Sample sizes were small, with 10 out of 13 studies involving fewer than 40 participants. No study reported sample size calculation. Nonetheless, cross-over trials are more powerful than a two-parallel-arm study of equal sample size. The equivalent sample size can be obtained by multiplying sample size (N) by 1/(1-R), where R is the correlation coefficient between repeated measures in the same participant. In the studies included in this review for which R could be computed, the efficiency ranged from 3 times (R = 0.66 in <LINK REF="STD-Kleweno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kleweno 2001</LINK>) to 12 times (R = 0.92 in <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1999</LINK>) that of an equally sized two-parallel-arm trial. However, the gain in power is counterbalanced by a number of potential issues, including generalisability of the findings if conducted using a small sample of homogeneous participants.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-02-19 15:07:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In the original version of this review, we judged that randomisation technique and allocation concealment were of good quality in only three studies. However, in the following updated version we decided that there is no risk of selection bias in studies testing several LVAs on the same participant in the same session, so we scored all studies as being at low risk of bias for this item. We maintained this decision in the current update.</P><P>We did not consider masking of participants, study personnel and outcome assessors, since this is not possible with most LVAs, and it may be meaningless for secondary outcomes such as preference-based measures. Only one study evaluating prism spectacles declared masking participants, care providers or outcome assessors.</P><P>Quality issues specific to cross-over-like trials were unclear because of poor reporting. We suggest that the risk of bias is likely to be low or moderate in the included studies. Simultaneous testing of devices avoids the risk of a period effect or a change of disease status between cross-over phases. The interventions should have limited carry-over effect, but this was formally assessed in only one study. Repeated testing may have induced learning effect or fatigue. Most studies addressed the issue of training regarding learning effects and seemed to reproduce testing conditions similar to the current LVA rehabilitation practice. No firm conclusion is possible. Methodological studies have shown that insufficient reporting often makes quality assessment of cross-over trials difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P><P>We were conscious that we could not assess inconsistency because only one or few studies were available for each comparison. However, we did not specifically downgrade the certainty of the evidence for this. In many cases, effect estimates were imprecise, and we downgraded for imprecision.

Nonetheless, we largely agree with <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2008</LINK> on the views quoted above, since we also found it hard to constrain the complexity of the use of each type of low-vision aid, by participants with different needs and characteristics, to a single psychophysical measure of performance such as reading speed.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 2013</LINK> conducted a systematic review to assess the effect of prisms for vision rehabilitation in people with macular function loss, including three randomised studies and six non-randomised studies or case series (727 participants). The primary outcome was distance visual acuity, which improved by &#8722;0.158 logMAR (95% CI 0.014 to 0.302 logMAR) in people wearing a prismatic correction. These results are not comparable with ours since we assessed reading ability and not visual acuity, and their interpretation is also made difficult by the inclusion of non-randomised studies and case series.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Binns-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binns 2012</LINK> has conducted a broad scope systematic review of effectiveness of low vision service provision. The results of this review are also difficult to compare with ours, since the presentation of quantitative results was not standard and review authors did not attempt any meta-analysis. They found 58 studies that met their liberal inclusion criteria, only seven of which were randomised controlled trials. They concluded that "although the literature is sufficient to confirm that rehabilitation services result in improved clinical and functional ability outcomes, the effects on mood, vision-related quality of life (QoL) and health-related QoL are less clear". They also concluded that "the number of well-designed and adequately reported studies is pitifully small; visual rehabilitation research needs higher quality research".</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Smallfield-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallfield 2013</LINK> conducted a systematic review of the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of occupational therapy interventions for improving the reading performance of older adults with low vision. The authors found 32 studies and concluded there was strong evidence supporting low vision programs that included occupational therapy and moderately strong evidence supporting the use of electronic magnification. However, <LINK REF="REF-Smallfield-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallfield 2013</LINK> reported the results narratively and their results are difficult to compare with those of our review.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-19 15:11:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-19 15:11:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>While provision of low-vision aids is useful for accessing smaller print sizes, there is insufficient evidence that a specific type of device allows faster reading speeds than other devices.</P><P>Two small studies found low-certainty evidence that stand-based CCTV and hand-held CCTV allows faster reading of ordinary print size than optical devices. However, better reading speed should be matched with portability, ease of use and affordability. Furthermore, it is unclear how we can identify the people who benefit more with electronic devices, some of which are more costly than optical devices. The technology of electronic devices may have improved since these studies took place.</P><P>One study found that prism spectacles are unlikely to be beneficial for people with AMD, although the data did not allow calculation of precise estimates of performance.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-19 09:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Low-vision researchers who design studies comparing reading performance using different LVAs consider a cross-over-like design appropriate. The advantage of this design is its greater efficiency compared to parallel-arms studies. However, poor reporting of cross-over trials is a limitation for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P><P>Moreover, we suggest that results from parallel-group randomised controlled studies are easier to interpret than cross-over-like studies in people with low vision. The need for a larger sample size in parallel-group studies makes them substantially more costly than cross-over-like studies. On the other hand, the inclusion of a large number of people may favour generalisability of the results.</P><P>Reasearchers should consider that important determinants of reading performance with respect to the optical device are magnification, field of view, working distance, illumination and clarity of the optics, which all need to be taken into account when designing a study of the use of LVAs or devices. Moreover, reading performance with a device can be influenced by the duration and type of training received. We suggest that future studies consider training as a fundamental component of the study design and its reporting.</P><P>We recognise that achieving better reading speed is only one of the desirable properties of an LVA compared to another. Researchers should also assess ease of use, frequency of use, sustained use and satisfaction by means of validated tools. Other considerations that are important to patients are physical comfort, weight, cosmesis and cost. Success in using an LVA may also be dependent on a person's needs and the training received, as well as other components of a multidisciplinary low-vision rehabilitation approach (<LINK REF="REF-Langelaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langelaan 2007</LINK>). We refer to <LINK REF="REF-Binns-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binns 2012</LINK> and to <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2013</LINK> for a broader discussion on outcome measures in low vision research.</P><P>The authors of this review believe that low-vision research should take into account the complexity of visual rehabilitation, including the impact of low-vision rehabilitation on an individual's daily functioning and quality of life. This would require a qualitative or mixed methods approach. A Cochrane Review focusing on vision or health-related quality of life outcomes and grouping interventions into broad categories, ranging from psychological therapies to methods of enhancing vision will soon be published (<LINK REF="REF-Langelaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langelaan 2007</LINK>). There is a need for reviews with such a broad scope; however, we also need primary research that recognises the complexity of low vision rehabilitation and measures long-term, patient-centred outcomes.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-04-06 10:55:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>For the original version and the updates of this review we thank the following study authors for providing additional data on their studies: <LINK REF="REF-Stelmack-2005-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stelmack 2005 (pers comm)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Culham-2005-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culham 2005 (pers comm)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodrich-2007-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodrich 2007 (pers comm)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolffsohn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolffsohn 2003</LINK> who provided data on <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2017-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2017 (pers comm)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-C-2017-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson C 2017 (pers comm)</LINK> who provided data on <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2017</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2017</LINK> who provided data on <LINK REF="STD-Morrice-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Morrice 2017</LINK>.</P><P>For the 2013 update (<LINK REF="REF-Virgili-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgili 2013</LINK>), we thank Lori Grover for co-authoring and Harold Burton, a low-vision aid user for commenting on the plain language summary, abstract and conclusions.</P><P>We are grateful to Louise Culham, Gary Rubin, Roberta Scherer, Alicja Rudnicka and Catey Bunce for peer review comments on earlier versions of this review.

We also specified that reading speed had to be measured at ordinary print size because this is the outcome most relevant to patients in terms of performance using a specific low-vision aid. We also specified that MNREAD definitions of maximum reading speed and reading acuity were adopted in our review, and we discuss the consequences of this choice in the update. We used raw reading acuity (words per minute) rather than its log transformation as done in the original version using individual values, because results are more interpretable on this scale, despite mild skewness.</LI><LI><B>Types of intervention</B>: we updated the inclusion criteria to include consumer electronics such as smart phones and tablets. We also specified the inclusion of coloured filters and prisms and clarified the exclusion of studies in which the intervention is a device to read though hearing, such as screen readers or talking books, or through touch, such as Braille-based devices and haptic devices.</LI><LI><B>Risk of bias assessment</B>: we adapted the 'Risk of bias' assessment following new guidance. We reconsidered the scoring of 'within-person' or cross-over-like studies, leading to adapted criteria to score the quality of randomisation and allocation concealment.</LI><LI><B>Search strategy</B>: we removed the RCT filter from the electronic searches in order to identify as many potentially relevant studies as possible.</LI></UL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Methods not implemented</HEADING><P>We did not implement the following planned methods because the relevant data were not available or not enough studies contributed data to any one analysis.

We will also calculate the risk difference or the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome.</LI><LI><B>Subgroup analyses</B>: we will assess the effect of low-vision severity (e.g. proportion of participants below 20/100 in the better eye), matching of LVAs by magnification versus no matching, participant age (e.g. proportion of people aged 55 years or more), study design (parallel-arm versus 'within-person').</LI><LI><B>Sensitivity analyses</B>: we will conduct sensitivity analyses with the following adjustments: excluding studies of lower methodological quality (scoring high risk of bias on any parameter of quality); excluding unpublished studies.</LI></UL><P>The search strategies were updated for the 2018 version of this review to reflect new technologies and devices being developed.</P></SUBSECTION></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES/></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-04-10 20:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">

METHOD. Subjects were 133 patients (mean age = 68.5 yrs) of the Western Blind Rehabilitation Center. Subjects were assigned to one of three groups based upon field loss: central (N = 90); peripheral (N = 28); or mixed central and peripheral field loss (N = 15).

CCTVs, as a low vision reading device, provided all subjects in this study with an average of 23% to 34% longer reading durations. Reading speeds averaged between 9% and 20% greater. Central loss subjects appear to gain the greatest benefit from CCTV, while mixed and peripheral loss subjects gain a greater reading duration with the CCTV. The relative benefits of devices for each patient group will be discussed in the context of information that may assist the clinician in prescribing low vision reading devices.

Reading durations with the Nomad were similar to that with CCTV; both of which were about 3X longer than optical devices. Subjective data indicated that subjects would prefer another color, or full-color laser for the Nomad and would like a more comfortable head-mount. Most subjects preferred the brightness and sharpness of the Nomad display to the displays of the optical devices and CCTVs. The brightness and high contrast may allow patients with extremely low vision to maintain, the ability to read visually even when conventional devices are no longer effective. CONCLUSIONS: the Nomad is a prototype display with potential as both a distance and near vision aid.

would be fine in an SoF table but should be described as '(95% confidence interval (CI) &amp;#8722;25.1 to 65.0)' in the main text. This may give rise to some confusion. I changed this, but I turned on the track changes on the off chance that review authors were using a different CI or a different measure of spread. Pls have a look and confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RE: thank you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENERAL: There were a couple of references to SoF tables that have obviously been discarded or moved up. I made a few changes to these (deleting dead links, including correct links, etc.), but in track changes.

<LINK REF="STD-Eperjesi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eperjesi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>), 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the estimates of effectiveness were adjusted using a conservative Bonferroni approach. As an example, performing three pairwise comparisons among three LVAs, such as in <LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001</LINK>, requires that 95% CIs are calculated dividing the conventional probability of type I error of 0.05 by 3. The adjusted probability is therefore 0.0167. Furthermore, sample size was small in most studies, suggesting the use of a t-distribution to compute confidence intervals. To exploit the intuitive graphical presentation allowed by Review Manager 5 (RevMan), which uses the Gaussian distribution and therefore large sample statistics (&gt; 30 people) while maintaining their correct coverage, we inflated the SE(MD) by an appropriate factor. Using <LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001</LINK> as an example, this factor was estimated as follows.</P><OL><LI>The t-value with the appropriate degrees of freedom (22 participants, df = 21) corresponding to a two-tailed probability of 0.0167 is 2.60.</LI><LI>The SE(MD) is obtained from the paper.</LI><LI>Since the z-value of 1.96 is used as a multiplier of the SE(MD) in RevMan to obtain the 95% CI, the factor used to inflate the SE(MD) is computed from the ratio 2.60/1.96 = 1.33.</LI><LI>Finally, the inflated SE is introduced in the 'Comparisons and data' RevMan tool in order to present forest plots that accommodate both the multiple comparisons (if any) and the small-sample statistical issues.</LI></OL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Correlation in cross-over studies</HEADING><P>In <LINK REF="STD-Culham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2004</LINK> the mean and the standard deviation (SD) for each of the four head-mounted electronic devices compared to the participant's optical device were available. The SE(MD), which is necessary to extract data from cross-over studies, were not presented. According to <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK> the SE(MD) can still be estimated provided that the correlation coefficient among measurements is known from similar studies. The correlation coefficient for reading speed between the stand-mounted CCTV and the electronic head-mounted device (HMD) was 0.92 in <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1999</LINK>, while it was 0.66 in <LINK REF="STD-Kleweno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kleweno 2001</LINK>, who used the Virtual Retinal Display as an HMD, as derived from published individual data. We used an intermediate value of 0.82 as an estimate of the correlation coefficient in <LINK REF="STD-Culham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goodrich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodrich 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2003</LINK>. This is a conservative assumption since the type of HMD in <LINK REF="STD-Culham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 2004</LINK> is more similar to <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1999</LINK> and considering that a lower correlation coefficient within participants leads to larger standard errors in cross-over studies. This can be calculated from the formulas suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>, which we used to compute the SE(MD).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Problems with data skewness</HEADING><P>As suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>, we chose not to extract data from <LINK REF="STD-Stelmack-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmack 1991</LINK> since there was evidence of marked skewness, with the standard deviations being larger than the mean in at least one group, and taking into consideration that reading speed cannot take negative values. Skewness was also suggested by the asymmetry of the mean within the reported range of values.</P><P>In the first version of this review, individual reading speed data from <LINK REF="STD-Eperjesi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eperjesi 2004</LINK> were log-transformed to approach normality before undertaking calculations. In the 2011 update, we decided to use raw data (words per minute) since skewness was mild and results are more interpretable on this scale.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Analyses of individual data</HEADING><P>In three publications (<LINK REF="STD-Eperjesi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eperjesi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleweno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kleweno 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 1999</LINK>), individual data were available in tables in the published reports. They were processed with repeated-measures techniques to obtain MD and SE(MD) using the Stata 9.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). A paired t-test was used when two LVAs were compared, and generalised estimating equations were used when more than two groups were compared. These techniques allowed estimates of SEs(MD) to be obtained that are adjusted for the correlation among measurements in the same participant. We used the Huber-White variance estimator for this purpose.</P></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;13 studies included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;1&lt;span&gt;0 studies included in previous version of the review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 conference abstracts and 1 full-text study report still awaiting classification from previous version of the review&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;5 reports of 3 new studies included in the review&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6 full-text reports and 1 conference abstract assessed&lt;/span&gt; for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="206"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;616 records screened by the authors&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;1004 records screened by the Cochrane Information Specialist (CIS)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="206"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;1004 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;1349 records identified through electronic database searching&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="207"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;388 records excluded by the CIS after initial screening&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="183"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;609 records excluded by the authors as not relevant&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="181"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;2 full-text articles excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="144"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
