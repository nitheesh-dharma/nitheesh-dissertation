<TITLE>Less extensive surgery for vulvar cancer appears safe and limits mutilation</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-23 13:11:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Vulvar cancer is rare, affecting mainly older women. Until the 1980s, affected women underwent extensive, mutilating surgery. Groin nodes on both sides as well as all vulvar tissue were removed. Recently surgeons have carried out a smaller operation, leaving as much vulvar tissue as possible behind. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the safety of this reduced surgery, but from the available evidence it appears to be safe to perform this smaller operation in most patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Radical surgery has been standard treatment for patients with early vulvar cancer since the mid 1900s. Survival figures are excellent, but complication rates are high. Since 1980, surgery has become more individualised in order to decrease complications in patients with limited disease. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness and safety of individualised treatment with that of standard extensive surgery. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:02:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (to April 2007). We also searched our own publication archives, based on prospective handsearching of six leading relevant journals from December 1986. Reference lists of identified studies, gynaecological cancer handbooks and conference abstracts were also scanned.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-04-23 13:13:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case controlled and observational studies on the effectiveness of surgery (local surgery and regional lymph node dissection) on patients with cT1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.</P>
<P>Outcome measures were overall, disease-specific, disease-free survival (DFS), treatment complications, quality of life (QoL).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-23 13:26:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Three review authors (AA, JVD, MS) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-06 11:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>From three studies, we concluded there was no difference in the incidence of:<BR/>1. local recurrent vulvar cancer between radical local excision and radical vulvectomy, or<BR/>2. groin recurrence between ipsilateral groin node dissection and bilateral groin node dissection in patients with a well lateralised tumour.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, superficial groin node dissection is not as safe as full femoro-inguinal lymph node dissection. The triple incision technique is a safe procedure provided tumour free margins are greater than 8 mm and the slight increase in recurrences does not outweigh the reduction in complications.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-03 13:28:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The available evidence regarding surgery for early vulvar cancer is generally poor. From the studies of sufficient quality we concluded that radical local excision is a safe alternative to radical vulvectomy for patients with early vulva carcinoma.</P>
<P>Contralateral groin node dissection can be omitted in patients with a lateralized tumour, and the triple incision technique is as safe as an en bloc dissection. However, omission of femoral lymph node dissection results in a higher incidence of groin recurrences.</P>
<P>Further good quality studies are required, though conducting RCTs on vulvar cancer treatment may not be realistic due to the rarity of the disease. However, observational studies of higher quality could provide us with more reliable evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-24 12:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Vulvar cancer is a disease of elderly women with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 70. The incidence in industrialized countries is two per 100.000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Platz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platz 1995</LINK>). In developing countries the (age adjusted) incidence is 50% lower. According to population-based studies, about 75% of vulvar malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Platz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Velden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Velden 1996</LINK>). The tumour metastasizes primarily to the inguinal lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1976</LINK>). Current standard treatment for patients with early squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (cT1-2N0M0 tumours) is primary surgery, followed by radiotherapy if indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1994</LINK>). Surgery consists of a radical excision of the tumour and a bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection. This treatment policy results in excellent survival figures, but also in high complication rates. Wound healing problems are observed in a large proportion of patients, and in the long term psychosexual complications and lymphoedema are frequently seen. Because of high complication rates, a more individualized approach has been developed in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1994</LINK>). Currently, patients with small tumours undergo less extensive surgery. The aim is to reduce complications without compromising survival. This individualization of treatment is based on case-control studies, studies with historic controls and observational studies. Only two RCTs, both addressing the role of radiotherapy in vulvar cancer treatment, have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Homesley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homesley 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stehman-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehman 1992b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most important developments in the surgical treatment of early vulvar cancer are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Radical vulvectomy replaced by a radical local excision of the tumour</LI>
<LI>En bloc dissection replaced by the so-called triple incision technique</LI>
<LI>Omission of contralateral lymph node dissection in patients with laterally localized and small tumours</LI>
<LI>Inguinal and femoral lymph node dissection replaced by inguinal lymph node dissection.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Our aim in this review is to determine whether there is clear evidence that the changes in surgical treatment strategy as mentioned above are safe and effective.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-04-23 13:53:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the effectiveness and safety of modified (individualized) treatment is comparable with that of more extensive surgery. The main outcomes of interest were survival, recurrence and complication rates.</P>
<P>The following issues were addressed in this review:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is a radical local excision as effective as radical vulvectomy?</LI>
<LI>Is the triple incision technique as effective as en bloc dissection?</LI>
<LI>Is an ipsilateral node dissection only as effective as a bilateral node dissection in patients with a lateral tumour?</LI>
<LI>Is an inguinal node dissection as effective as an inguinal and femoral node dissection?</LI>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-24 12:10:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Selection of studies was carried out by three review author (AA, JV, MS). No effort was made to blind the review authors to names of authors, institutions, journals etcetera. The reason for this was that all the both review authors were too familiar with the literature on vulvar cancer treatment and would have recognized most studies even when they were blinded.</P>
<P>As it was known to the review autors that only a small number of RCTs have been published, other types of studies were incorporated in this review, i.e. prospective observational studies, case-control studies and studies with historic controls.</P>
<P>First selection criteria were the following</P>
<OL>
<LI>The study deals with cT1-2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva patients.</LI>
<LI>The topic of the study is effectiveness of surgical treatment. One or more of the above mentioned issues is addressed.</LI>
<LI>In RCTs, treatment is uniform within a treatment arm</LI>
<LI>In case-control and historic control studies, treatment is uniform within each group</LI>
<LI>In observational studies, treatment is uniform in the entire group.</LI>

The critical review forms were filled out independently by both authors. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Not a single study met all the criteria that were set out in the critical review forms. However, excluding all studies from further analysis would result in no systematic review at all. Therefore it was decided to include studies that met at least the following criteria:</P>

<P>After the first selection, we had identified five studies to answer this question. However, after using the critical review form, only one of these five studies was selected. In the study by Hacker (<LINK REF="STD-Hacker-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hacker 1981</LINK>), 14 patients had 'old' FIGO stage III disease. It was not possible to analyse the other 86 separately. In the study of Helm (<LINK REF="STD-Helm-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 1992</LINK>), the only study with matched controls, a similar problem was present. In addition the treatment was not uniform in the experimental arm. In 'general', a superficial groin node dissection was performed, but in 'some cases' (no numbers stated), femoral nodes were dissected as well. In the study by Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1993</LINK>), 10 out of 100 patients had no squamous cell carcinoma, but a tumour of another cell type. In the study of Farias-Eisner (<LINK REF="STD-Farias_x002d_Eisner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farias-Eisner 1994</LINK>) the interventions were not uniform.</P>
<P>The study by de Hullu (<LINK REF="STD-de-Hullu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Hullu 2002</LINK>) showed that recurrences in either groin or skin bridge were more frequent after wide local excision and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy through separate incisions (13.2% versus 21,5% within two years). All recurrences had developed in patients with at least one tumour free margin less than 8 mm. In this study QoL and treatment morbidity were not registered; this should be weighed against the increase in recurrence rate. Provided that tumour free margins of greater than 8mm are considered the separate incision technique is safe as the combined incidence of skin bridge and groin recurrences still remains very low and does not outweigh the reduction in complications as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>.</P>

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1995</LINK>) that may answer this question was selected. From <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>, it is obvious that recurrent disease in a previously undissected groin is a relatively rare event after an ipsilateral groin node dissection in a patient with a lateral tumour. This occurred in only one patient, and she was salvaged by groin dissection and radiotherapy.</P>

<P>It is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK> that groin recurrences did not occur in the (highly selected) patients studied by DiSaia (<LINK REF="STD-DiSaia-1979" TYPE="STUDY">DiSaia 1979</LINK>), but did occur in the patients studied by Burke (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1995</LINK>). All three groin recurrences occurred in previously tumour negative groins.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-04-24 11:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The main problem when trying to conduct a systematic review on vulvar cancer treatment is the lack of studies with sufficient quality. As we are dealing with a rare disease, it is not realistic to expect that a large number of RCTs been done. However, the conduction of observational studies of good quality should be feasible. The current systematic review taught us that even a good quality observational study is a rare feature.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-05-06 12:04:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Main methodological problems in the identified studies were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The definition of the type of participants. In 1988, FIGO staging for vulvar cancer patients was changed from a clinical into a surgical /pathological staging system. Thus, according to the new staging system, the FIGO stage cannot be established until after surgical treatment. As a consequence, it is not possible to define a preoperatively uniform patient group in terms of FIGO staging. Unfortunately, the use of the clinical Tumour-Nodes-Metastssis (TNM) system is not widespread. Many clinicians still tend to use the old (clinical) FIGO staging for preoperative assessment. As a result, considerable confusion exists regarding the definition of patient groups. Comparison of interventions is virtually impossible when the type of participants is ill-defined. Another problem is to define which tumours are lateral, and which ones are medial/median.</LI>
<LI>The definition of interventions. In only a limited number of studies, surgical interventions are defined adequately. In particular, there is a considerable problem with the definition of the lymph node dissection. Levenback (<LINK REF="REF-Levenback-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levenback 1996</LINK>) developed a questionnaire regarding the surgical interventions in vulvar cancer patients. This questionnaire was distributed among 50 gynecologic oncologists in the USA, 44 of whom were board-certified. Even among this group of selected, well trained gynecologic oncologists, there was poor agreement regarding the definition of superficial inguinal and femoro-inguinal groin node dissection. We expect that the lack of agreement regarding the definition of interventions will not be better among other gynaecologic oncologists. For radiotherapy interventions, the situation is even worse, as they are seldom addressed at all in studies with a surgeon as the first author.</LI>
<LI>Studies with uniform interventions are extremely rare. This makes comparison of different types of treatment difficult.</LI>
<LI>Follow up problems were encounted as not all patients are accounted for at the end of follow up, and duration of follow up was often obscure.</LI>
<LI>The main goal of individualized (i.e. in many cases less radical) treatment is the reduction of perioperative and long term complications. However, from the available evidence, it is not clear whether complication rates have decreased. This is due to the lack of data on incidence of complications and the lack of clear definitions of grade of complications.</LI>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-06 12:05:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Good quality studies of surgical treatment for vulvar cancer are rare. We identified only two observational (and no other type) studies that just met the minimum criteria as set by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the methodological problems, we feel that we can draw some conclusions from the available evidence that may have implications for practice.<BR/>1. For patients with T1-2 tumours, radical local vulvar excision is a safe treatment option.<BR/>2. In early vulvar cancer the incidence of skin bridge recurrence after treatment with the triple incision technique is low, probably no more than one per cent provided a tumour free margin of greater than 8 mm. Therefore, it appears to be safe to replace en bloc dissection by the triple incision technique in cT1-2N0M0 vulvar cancers.<BR/>3. From the limited evidence available, it appears that ipsilateral groin node dissection is safe in patients with a lateral cT1N0M0 tumour.<BR/>4. Omission of femoral lymph node dissection is unsafe. Even in a population with a very favourable prognosis, 3 in 76 (four per cent) groin recurrences were observed in previously operated groins.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-04-28 11:54:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Because vulvar cancer is a rare disease with a good prognosis in early stages, it will be difficult to conduct RCTs sufficient numbers. However, observational studies can also help to increase the amount of evidence. Until now, the majority of published observational studies do not meet the minimum criteria set by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Thus, there is considerable room for improvement.</P>
<P>Future observational studies on the effectiveness of surgical treatment of early vulvar cancer should at least meet the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Clear definitions of type of participants and type of interventions</LI>
<LI>Uniform interventions</LI>
<LI>Clearly stated follow up time</LI>
<LI>Clearly accounted follow up status for all participants</LI>
<LI>Definition of type, incidence and grade of complications.</LI>
