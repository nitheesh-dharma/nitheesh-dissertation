<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We investigated if giving drugs before surgery for uterine fibroids improves outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Uterine fibroids are smooth muscle tumours of the uterus (womb) that can cause fertility problems, heavy menstrual bleeding, repeated pregnancy loss and pelvic pain. Fibroids are usually treated by surgery. Some drugs, particularly gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), have been used to temporarily control bleeding and reduce fibroid and uterine size before surgery. They are unsuitable for long-term use because they may cause bone loss. Other drugs, including progestins, dopamine agonists, selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), oestrogen receptor antagonists and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), may also provide benefits used short-term. However, such therapies tend to be expensive.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence to June 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 38 studies that involved 3623 women with fibroids that caused symptoms and who were scheduled for surgery to remove the fibroids. Surgeries were either hysterectomy (uterus removal) or myomectomy or resection (removal of fibroids from the uterus wall). Many women were anaemic (had low red blood cell or haemoglobin levels).</P>
<P>The studies compared GnRHa with no treatment or sham treatment, GnRHa with other medical treatments, and SPRMs with sham treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>Fourteen studies were either wholly or partially funded by pharmaceutical companies; three were funded by institutions or hospitals; the source of funding was unclear for 21 trials. It was not possible to determine whether funding source influenced results.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>GnRHa increased haemoglobin levels before surgery and decreased uterine and fibroid size, compared with no treatment or placebo. Blood loss, need for blood transfusion, operation time during hysterectomy and postoperative complications were reduced. However, women were more likely to experience hot flushes during treatment. An SPRM drug (ulipristal acetate) had similar benefits, particularly reduced bleeding. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness and distinguish between groups of women with fibroids who would most benefit.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence for most outcomes was low or very low, meaning there is substantial uncertainty about findings. Quality limitations included lack of reporting of randomisation methods and allocation concealment, lack of blinding (which means that knowledge of treatment could have influenced the findings) and variation in findings among studies. Some findings were imprecise because they were based on only one study.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-04 11:38:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Uterine fibroids occur in up to 40% of women aged over 35 years. Some are asymptomatic, but up to 50% cause symptoms that warrant therapy. Symptoms include anaemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and low quality of life. Surgery is the first choice of treatment. In recent years, medical therapies have been used before surgery to improve intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. However, such therapies tend to be expensive.</P>
<P>Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen. Gonadotropin-hormone releasing analogues (GnRHa) induce a state of hypo-oestrogenism that shrinks fibroids , but has unacceptable side effects if used long-term. Other potential hormonal treatments, include progestins and selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs).</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2000 and 2001; the scope has been broadened to include all preoperative medical treatments.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-05 13:18:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We included a total of 38 RCTs (3623 women); 19 studies compared GnRHa to no pretreatment (n = 19), placebo (n = 8), other medical pretreatments (progestin, SPRMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor antagonists) (n = 7), and four compared SPRMs with placebo. Most results provided low-quality evidence due to limitations in study design (poor reporting of randomisation procedures, lack of blinding), imprecision and inconsistency.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>GnRHa versus no treatment or placebo</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>GnRHa treatments were associated with reductions in both uterine (MD -175 mL, 95% CI -219.0 to -131.7; 13 studies; 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-quality evidence) and fibroid volume (heterogeneous studies, MD 5.7 mL to 155.4 mL), and increased preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.88 g/dL, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1; 10 studies; 834 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), at the expense of a greater likelihood of adverse events, particularly hot flushes (OR 7.68, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.0; 6 studies; 877 participants; I² = 46%; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Duration of hysterectomy surgery was reduced among women who received GnRHa treatment (-9.59 minutes, 95% CI 15.9 to -3.28; 6 studies; 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-quality evidence) and there was less blood loss (heterogeneous studies, MD 25 mL to 148 mL), fewer blood transfusions (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; 6 studies; 601 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), and fewer postoperative complications (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; 7 studies; 772 participants; I² = 28%; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>GnRHa appeared to reduce intraoperative blood loss during myomectomy (MD 22 mL to 157 mL). There was no clear evidence of a difference among groups for other primary outcomes after myomectomy: duration of surgery (studies too heterogeneous for pooling), blood transfusions (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.8; 4 studies; 121 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) or postoperative complications (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 5 studies; 190 participants; low-quality evidence). No suitable data were available for analysis of preoperative bleeding.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>GnRHa versus other medical therapies</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>GnRHa was associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume (-47% with GnRHa compared to -20% and -22% with 5 mg and 10 mg ulipristal acetate) but was more likely to cause hot flushes (OR 12.3, 95% CI 4.04 to 37.48; 5 studies; 183 participants; I² = 61%; low-quality evidence) compared with ulipristal acetate. There was no clear evidence of a difference in bleeding reduction (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.7; 1 study; 199 participants; moderate-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1; 1 study; 203 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or haemoglobin levels (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.2; 188 participants; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of a difference in fibroid volume between GnRHa and cabergoline (MD 12.71 mL, 95% CI -5.9 to 31.3; 2 studies; 110 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>The included studies did not report usable data for any other primary outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>SPRMs versus placebo</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>SPRMs (mifepristone, CDB-2914, ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) were associated with greater reductions in uterine or fibroid volume than placebo (studies too heterogeneous to pool) and increased preoperative haemoglobin levels (MD 0.93 g/dL, 0.5 to 1.4; 2 studies; 173 participants; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil were also associated with greater reductions in bleeding before surgery (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 41.41, 95% CI 15.3 to 112.4; 1 study; 143 participants; low-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 78.83, 95% CI 24.0 to 258.7; 1 study; 146 participants; low-quality evidence; asoprisnil: MD -166.9 mL; 95% CI -277.6 to -56.2; 1 study; 22 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of differences in preoperative complications. No other primary outcomes were measured.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-05 13:19:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>A rationale for the use of preoperative medical therapy before surgery for fibroids is to make surgery easier. There is clear evidence that preoperative GnRHa reduces uterine and fibroid volume, and increases preoperative haemoglobin levels, although GnRHa increases the incidence of hot flushes. During hysterectomy, blood loss, operation time and complication rates were also reduced. Evidence suggests that ulipristal acetate may offer similar advantages (reduced fibroid volume and fibroid-related bleeding and increased haemoglobin levels) although replication of these studies is advised before firm conclusions can be made. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness and distinguish between groups of women with fibroids who would most benefit.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-18 13:19:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uterine fibroids (also known as myomas or leiomyomas) are the most common benign tumour of the female reproductive tract which are thought to affect approximately 20% to 40% of women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Jacoby-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacoby 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallach-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallach 1992</LINK>), although it is possible prevalence may be even higher (70% to 80%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2003</LINK>). Fibroids are classified according to their anatomic location as subserosal, intramural and submucosal types (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2011</LINK>). Many fibroids are asymptomatic but a proportion of women have heavy menstrual bleeding (30%), anaemia, dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and pressure symptoms (34%), reduced quality of life and reduced fertility (27%) (<LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1981</LINK>). The standard treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids are surgical and radiological interventions. Fibroids are the most common indication for hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Merrill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merrill 2008</LINK>); less invasive procedures include myomectomy (in women wishing to preserve their fertility), hysteroscopic removal, uterine artery embolisation and other radiological interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2014</LINK>). Fibroids represent one of the most frequent indications for major surgery in premenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Carls-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carls 2008</LINK>) and as such they constitute a major public health cost.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-04 11:29:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Some medical therapies are currently being investigated as stand-alone treatments for fibroids, but the role of this review was to investigate medical therapies before surgery. These preoperative medical treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), progestins, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, dopamine agonists, prostaglandin analogues and selective progesterone receptor modulators.</P>
<P>Since the 1980s, GnRHa treatments, which induce a state of hypo-oestrogenism by suppressing pituitary ovarian function, have been investigated for women with fibroids. The main effects of this treatment are the temporary control of bleeding and reduction of fibroid and uterine size, but side effects include menopausal symptoms and bone loss with long-term use. After therapy is stopped, there is re-growth of both the tumours and the uterus to almost their pretreatment size, and in most women, a recurrence of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Matta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matta 1989</LINK>). Thus, they have been approved only for short-term use, as a preoperative adjunct to surgery.</P>
<P>Other potential hormonal therapies have also been investigated as preoperative treatment. Progestins have been used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding induced by fibroids but have thromboembolic and metabolic risks (<LINK REF="REF-Jourdain-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jourdain 1996</LINK>). Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis but preclinical studies suggest they may inhibit the proliferation of fibroid cells, consequently limiting their growth (<LINK REF="REF-Jirecek-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jirecek 2004</LINK>). Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), such as asoprisnil, mifepristone and ulipristal acetate, have more recently been investigated, and in 2012, ulipristal acetate was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids over a maximum of three months for preoperative management (<LINK REF="REF-P_x00e9_rez-Lopez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pérez Lopez 2014</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-27 14:30:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the pathogenesis of fibroids is not well established, it has been recognised that fibroid growth and maintenance are stimulated by oestrogen and affected by hormonal cyclic changes (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1990</LINK>). Oestradiol and progesterone receptors have been identified in myomatous tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Tamaya-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamaya 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>). Because of this dependence of fibroids on steroid hormones, it follows that medications to reduce the levels of gonadal steroids might be options for the treatment of uterine fibroids. If a state of reduced oestrogen secretion could be induced, this would result in the reduction in growth of fibroids and even their regression. Additionally, as progesterone is known to promote the growth of fibroids, modulating the progesterone pathway by acting on progesterone receptors in myometrial tissue may control heavy menstrual bleeding and reduce fibroid bulk (<LINK REF="STD-Donnez-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 2012a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pretreatment with medical therapy before hysterectomy is considered particularly useful for women with severe anaemia and to reduce blood loss during surgery. Other indications have included large fibroids or other factors that make surgery technically difficult (<LINK REF="REF-West-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1992</LINK>). Pretreatment with medical therapy may also enable greater use of vaginal hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Stovall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovall 1991</LINK>) compared to abdominal hysterectomy or even more conservative surgical options such as laparoscopic or hysteroscopic removal.</P>
<P>Conservative surgery, or myomectomy, has generally been used for women who wish to preserve or enhance their fertility but is often regarded as a more difficult procedure than hysterectomy, with a high risk of postoperative pyrexia (fever), pelvic haematoma formation and postoperative adhesions. Moreover, intraoperative haemorrhage can necessitate emergency blood transfusion or hysterectomy. Myomectomy may be performed via laparotomy, laparoscopy or hysteroscopy and the method must be distinguished in the evaluation of pretreatment with medical agents. Potential benefits of preoperative medical treatments are reduction in blood loss during the operation, ease of operability, better anatomical reconstruction and the possibility of using a transverse (Pfannenstiel-type) rather than vertical midline incision at laparotomy. However, concern has been expressed that the fibroid capsule would become less evident and may be missed, tumours will not 'shell out' cleanly and the excision may be more difficult (<LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stovall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovall 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A less invasive surgical option, hysteroscopic resection, is often used in women with submucous fibroids. This option offers advantages over myomectomy such as reduced trauma, shorter hospitalisation and recovery times and decreased risk of adhesion formation. GnRH analogues have been used preoperatively before this surgery for some time, but robust evidence to support this practice is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Parazzini-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parazzini 1998</LINK>). Controlled non-randomised studies have been undertaken but have reported conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Campo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perino-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perino 1993</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-04 11:29:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Fibroids represent one of the most frequent indications for major surgery in premenopausal women. GnRH analogues, and more latterly other types of medical therapy, have been investigated before surgery for uterine fibroids to improve intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. It is important to determine precisely the specific advantages and disadvantages of this practice compared to no presurgical therapies and to compare the effectiveness of individual presurgical therapies.</P>

<UL>
<LI>progestins;</LI>
<LI>selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs);</LI>
<LI>selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs);</LI>
<LI>dopamine agonists; and</LI>

<P>Misoprostol, another therapy that has been used particularly before myomectomy, was not included; its effectiveness was considered (along with other interventions for the prevention of haemorrhage specifically in myomectomy) in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Kongnyuy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kongnyuy 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>We made the following comparisons:</P>

<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. incidence of adverse events), we used the number of events in the control (or other treatment) and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR). For continuous data, (e.g. uterine volume) we calculated the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. We reversed the direction of effect of different studies, when required, to ensure consistency across trials. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.</P>

<P>The data were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, as far as possible, and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists.</P>
<P>Where data to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, we used the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of the included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values, standard error of the mean). Where this was not possible (e.g. missing measure of variation), we imputed values for the missing data by entering the largest comparable measure used by the other pooled studies. Any imputation was subjected to sensitivity analysis. Otherwise, if imputation was not feasible or realistic, only the available data were analysed.</P>

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 14:13:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since many of the outcomes assessed were likely to be influenced by other factors such as different hospital policies in different countries (e.g. hospital stay, duration of surgery) or differences in participants' characteristics (size of fibroids, haemoglobin levels), we combined data using random-effects models to compare intervention with control (or other treatment).</P>
<P>Outcomes with continuous data were assessed for the likelihood of skew. Where the authors of individual studies reported a median and range, or where the methods used to analyse the data were non parametric, it was considered that skew was likely. For other outcomes, where a mean and SD were reported, a rough check was made, where possible, by calculating the observed mean minus the lowest possible value (or the highest possible value minus the observed mean) and dividing this by the standard deviation. Where this ratio was less than 1, it was considered that skew was likely.</P>
<P>Where skew was considered likely, the outcome data were not pooled in a meta-analysis but displayed in other data tables. The findings of each of these studies were included in the interpretation of overall results for each outcome.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-08-04 17:17:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As assessment of some outcomes could be influenced by participant knowledge of whether they were receiving pretreatment or not, we conducted subgroup analyses (where possible) to determine the separate evidence according to whether control group women with fibroids went on to immediate surgery or had no pretreatment, or whether there was placebo control. No other subgroup analysis was undertaken.</P>
<P>In most cases, a pooled effect estimate was calculated to combine the results of both subgroups but where there were markedly different estimates, a summary effect measure was not calculated. The findings within each subgroup informed the interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>Where moderate heterogeneity was detected (I² &gt; 50%), we explored possible explanations by checking the data and by examining clinical and methodological differences among studies to determine whether there was any plausible explanation. We took statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, particularly when there was variation in the direction of effect.</P>
<P>Where considerable statistical heterogeneity was detected (I² &gt; 75%), we did not pool the studies but displayed individual study results on a forest plot, without calculating a summary effect estimate.</P>
</SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS>
<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-08-27 14:48:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses, where possible, for the primary outcomes to determine whether the conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding eligibility and analysis. These analyses included consideration of whether the review conclusions would have differed if:</P>
<OL>
<LI>eligibility was restricted to studies without high risk of bias; or</LI>
<LI>a fixed-effect model had been adopted.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We also undertook sensitivity analysis for comparison 5: GnRHa versus other medical treatments. 'Other medical treatments' constituted SPRMs, SERMs, dopamine agonists, progestins and oestrogen receptor antagonists. Data from the included studies for the trials assessing these other treatments were scarce and so these treatments were combined until further data becomes available to enable separate sensible comparisons. It was recognised that the different treatments might have different effects on the outcomes and sensitivity analyses were undertaken, where necessary, to assess whether these effects could be distinguished.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall quality of the body of evidence</HEADING>
<P>One review author (AL) generated 'Summary of findings' (SoF) tables using GRADEpro software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK>). Another review author (LP) checked the SoF tables for errors but no disagreements between authors were identified. The SoF tables displayed findings for all the primary outcomes (those considered most critical), as well as adverse events (which was a secondary outcome). The primary outcomes for all stages of assessment were: uterine or fibroid volume, preoperative haemoglobin, reduction of fibroid-related bleeding, duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, requirement for blood transfusion, and complications.</P>
<P>The SoF tables evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the primary review outcomes, using GRADE criteria (study limitations (risk of bias), consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias). Judgments about overall evidence quality (very low, low, moderate or high) were documented alongside the overall results for each of the primary outcomes, enabling judgments to be made with respect to the confidence in these results (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants in all studies had symptomatic fibroids, mostly diagnosed by ultrasound, and were scheduled for surgery. About half of the studies did not specify any details regarding size or type of fibroid. The remaining trials had various requirements; some excluded submucous or subserous fibroids, and others only included these types of fibroids; where size of the uterus in gestational weeks was a requirement, this was specified as greater than 8, 12, 14 and 16 gestational weeks with two trials assessing women with large uteri (over 18 gestational weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Stovall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stovall 1994</LINK> or &#8805; 600 cm³ in <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1989</LINK>). Where size of fibroids was a requirement, this was usually specified as larger than 2 cm or larger than 3 cm. Six studies required that women had evidence of anaemia (2 required haemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL; 2 required haemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL; and 2 required diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia). Two other studies required women to have haemoglobin values over 10 g/dL. Two studies enrolled women with fibroids and infertility (<LINK REF="STD-Campo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Campo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type of surgery varied among the studies. Surgery was either unspecified or was described as either myomectomy or hysterectomy in 12 studies. Participants had hysterectomy (unspecified or abdominal) in 12 studies and in one study participants received laparoscopic hysterectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Seraccholi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seraccholi 2003</LINK>). Myomectomy (unspecified) was performed in seven studies, two had laparoscopic myomectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Campo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Campo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 1998</LINK>) and one had both laparotomic and laparoscopic myomectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Hudecek-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hudecek 2012</LINK>). Two studies offered women fibroid resection (<LINK REF="STD-Mavrelos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mavrelos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muzii-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Muzii 2010</LINK>) but only data from <LINK REF="STD-Muzii-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Muzii 2010</LINK> could be included in analyses; only a proportion of women in <LINK REF="STD-Mavrelos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mavrelos 2010</LINK> went on to have surgery.</P>

<P>A number of different GnRHa preparations were administered via different routes and regimens. Leuprolide acetate, goserelin and triptorelin were given either by intramuscular depot injection or subcutaneous depot implant every four weeks before surgery; in three studies nafarelin or buserelin were given daily by nasal spray (<LINK REF="STD-Bustos-L_x00f3_pez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bustos López 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cetin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cetin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fedele-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fedele 1990</LINK>). Duration of treatment ranged from two to three months, and in one study, participants were treated for four months (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1989</LINK>). In those trials with no preoperative treatment arm, control group participants had surgery either immediately or as soon as practicable, but in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolov--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cagnacci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cagnacci 1994</LINK>) there was a three month observation period before surgery equivalent to the duration of treatment in the GnRHa group.</P>
<P>Dosages for depot formulations were 3.6 mg (goserelin), 3.75 mg (leuprolide acetate or triptorelin) or 3.2 mg (triptorelin). However, in two studies a larger dose was administered to cover the three month pretreatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Muneyyirci_x002d_Delale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muneyyirci-Delale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seraccholi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seraccholi 2003</LINK>).

Two doses of leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg and 7.5 mg) were compared with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Stovall-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stovall 1995</LINK>, and sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess whether dosage influenced results. Two of the placebo trials included iron in both treatment arms since participants were anaemic (<LINK REF="STD-Benagiano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benagiano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stovall-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stovall 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Benagiano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benagiano 1996</LINK> also included a GnRHa + placebo iron arm which was not considered in this review.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes from the included studies were characterised within the comparisons as preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative. Since intraoperative or postoperative outcomes were influenced by type of surgery, it was necessary to divide the timing of the outcomes in the comparisons, so that these outcomes were measured in separate comparisons according to type of surgery performed. There were sufficient studies to distinguish the comparisons in this way when GnRHa was compared with no treatment or placebo, but not when other types of presurgical treatments were compared.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Preoperative outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary review outcomes:</HEADING>
<P>Preoperative uterine or fibroid or both uterine and fibroid volume was calculated either by the prolate ellipsoid method and the formula V = 0.5233 (D1 X D2 X D3), where D1, D2 and D3 are the longitudinal, transverse and cross-sectional diameters of the uterus or fibroid, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Geirsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geirsson 1993</LINK>), the water displacement method, or magnetic resonance imaging in 24 studies. Other preoperative outcomes included haemoglobin levels (after pretreatment and before surgery commenced (19 studies)) and bleeding prior to surgery; two trials evaluating an SPRM (ulipristal acetate) (<LINK REF="STD-Donnez-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donnez-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 2012b</LINK>) measured the influence of interventions on menstrual bleeding before surgery using the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score and <LINK REF="STD-Wilkens-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkens 2008</LINK> used a similar assessment for menstrual bleeding (a menstrual pictogram).</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary review outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>Studies reported adverse events (from pretreatment (20 studies)) and withdrawal because of adverse events (8 studies). However, data on adverse events in some trials were either too poorly reported or not given for the control group; data could not be extracted from these trials. Quality of life was measured in four trials (two piloted a Measurement of Discomfort due to Fibroids questionnaire, one study used the SF-36 and Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QoL), and another used only the UFS-QoL (but data for these latter two studies were insufficient for extraction)).</P>

<P>Other intraoperative outcomes included: degree of difficulty of surgery (estimated by surgeons) (6 studies), rate of performance of vaginal hysterectomy (3 studies) (in hysterectomy participants), and rate of vertical incisions (5 studies). Duration of hospital stay was measured by 10 studies; however (as with duration of surgery), because of numerous confounding factors likely to influence these outcomes, the studies were not pooled but individual estimates for each trial were shown on forest plots.

<P>Seventeen studies evaluated this outcome (12 had a no pretreatment arm and 5 had a placebo arm). Four of these studies either had skewed data or the data were in a form that precluded pooling. The individual findings for these studies are reported in tabular format (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Given substantial heterogeneity in the subgroup where GnRHa was compared to a no treatment control group, we investigated the characteristics of the studies to determine potential causes of the variation in effects. The elimination of the data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zullo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 1998</LINK>) markedly reduced the heterogeneity. This study focused on participants where the main fibroids were intramural and GnRHa treatment was given for only two months (with the majority of included studies having three or four months of active treatment). In addition, variation in the findings could be expected given the variability in participants with respect to initial uterus size and number and type of fibroids. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the body of evidence for this analysis, GnRHa fairly consistently reduced uterine volume when compared to control, with uterus volume ranging from a value of 80 cc to 570.1 cc in the GnRHa groups compared to a range of 255 cc to 920 cc in the control groups.</P>
<P>When the overall estimates were combined regardless of type of control group (no pretreatment or placebo), GnRHa pretreatment was associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume compared to control (MD 175.3 mL, 95% CI -219.0 to -131.7; 13 studies; 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-quality evidence).</P>

<P>Six studies comparing GnRHa with no pretreatment and three studies comparing GnRHa with placebo assessed duration of surgery (2 no pretreatment and 1 placebo-controlled trials were reported in tabular format; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1706222136169351959118625053674&amp;format=REVMAN#CMP-002.01">Analysis 2.1</A>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). There was moderate evidence of heterogeneity in the body of evidence. Heterogeneity was expected, given differences in the expertise of the surgeons, variable methods of measuring the length of the surgery and, in particular, the type of hysterectomy performed. One trial undertook laparoscopic hysterectomy and two studies performed vaginal as well as abdominal hysterectomy, where possible.</P>
<P>Overall, when studies were combined (control group either no pretreatment or placebo), GnRHa reduced duration of surgery by 9.6 minutes (MD 9.6 min, 95% CI -15.9 to -3.3; 6 studies; 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-quality evidence; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1706222136169351959118625053674&amp;format=REVMAN#CMP-002.02">Analysis 2.2</A>).</P>

<P>Many individual adverse events were measured by only a few of the relevant trials and definitions may have varied influencing the reliability of the results. As GnRHa has been compared to other medical treatments before surgery, overall totals where there are more than one trial need to be broken down. There was clear evidence that hot flushes were more likely with GnRHa pretreatment compared to other medical pretreatments (which included raloxifene, ulipristal acetate, mifepristone, cabergoline and lynestrenol) (OR 12.3, 95% CI 4.0 to 37.5; 5 studies; 183 participants; I² = 61%; low-quality evidence). The odds of headache (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.1 to 18.6; 4 studies; 102 participants; I² = 67%; low-quality evidence; Analysis 5.6.2), sleep problems (OR 20.71, 95% CI 2.5 to 172; 1 study; 56 participants; very low-quality evidence; Analysis 5.6.6) and bone sensitivity (OR 125.8, 95% CI 6.8 to 2343.3; 1 study; 50 participants; very low-quality evidence; Analysis 5.6.20) were also increased with GnRHa.

<P>Where there was more than one study in the comparison, sensitivity analyses were undertaken to establish the differential effects of the other medical therapies (which were combined as control in the comparison). For hot flushes, GnRHa was associated with a greater odds of hot flushes when compared with other medical treatments independently, with odds ratios varying from 5.7 (ulipristal acetate), 6.45 (lynestrenol), 9.0 (raloxifene), 221.0 (mifepristone) and 327.9 (cabergoline).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-03 17:48:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We assessed the effect of preoperative medical therapy on a number of important preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes for resection, myomectomy and hysterectomy in the surgical treatment of women with uterine fibroids. A rationale for the use of preoperative medical therapy is to reduce the difficulty of any surgical procedure and thereby improve associated outcomes. The included studies did not contribute data to every outcome and, for some outcomes, findings were stratified according to whether the control group was no pretreatment or placebo. Summaries of overall results for the main outcomes, with overall quality assessments, are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gonadotropin-hormone releasing analogues (GnRHa) versus no pretreatment or placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Preoperative outcomes (versus no treatment or placebo)</HEADING>
<P>The combined results of both placebo-controlled and GnRHa versus no treatment trials strongly suggest that, regardless of subsequent surgery, the use of GnRHa is associated with an increase in preoperative haemoglobin, and a reduction in both uterine and fibroid volume, although this came at the expense of a greater likelihood (odds) of adverse events, in particular hot flushes, headache, dizziness, vaginitis, change in breast size and sweating.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes during and after hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>Duration of surgery was reduced by up to 14 minutes with GnRHa pretreatment in most studies, although some studies with skewed data did not find a benefit of pretreatment. Other benefits of GnRHa pretreatment included: a significant reduction in blood loss and the need for blood transfusions, smaller odds of requiring vertical incision, lower likelihood (odds) of difficult surgery (only in placebo trials) and improved postoperative haemoglobin levels. Evidence was inconsistent with respect to duration of hospital stay and odds of performance of vaginal rather than abdominal surgery. The odds of complications were also reduced with GnRHa pretreatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes during and after myomectomy</HEADING>
<P>In women undergoing myomectomy, most trials found that GnRHa reduced intraoperative blood loss, although substantial heterogeneity was found and no overall pooled estimate could be calculated. There was no evidence that pretreatment influenced duration of surgery, odds of intraoperative blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, and recurrence of fibroids or postoperative haemoglobin levels. One small trial found that in women undergoing abdominal myomectomy, the odds of vertical incision were reduced and another trial found that pretreatment was associated with greater postoperative haemoglobin levels. However, because of small numbers, these findings are very uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes during and after endometrial resection</HEADING>
<P>One small study found that duration of surgery was reduced by a mean of 5.4 minutes with GnRHa pretreatment when compared to no pretreatment, although this is not likely to be clinically important. There was no evidence of a difference in the perception of difficult surgery or recurrence of fibroids with GnRHa pretreatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">GnRHa versus other medical therapies (lynestrenol, selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs), selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor agonists)</HEADING>
<P>For most comparisons and outcomes, only one trial contributed data, because control groups were stratified according to type of medical therapy being compared to GnRHa. Two trials compared GnRHa with multiple doses of the control medical therapy (of ulipristal acetate and fulvestrant). Only the trial comparing GnRHa with ulipristal acetate was placebo-controlled with double blinding. Because of few data, the other medical therapies were combined in one control group, and sensitivity analyses undertaken to determine the differential effects of the treatments.</P>
<P>With regard to uterine volume, there was no evidence of a difference between GnRHa and raloxifene or mifepristone, but GnRHa pretreatment was associated with a greater reduction in volume than ulipristal acetate, regardless of dosage of ulipristal acetate. With respect to fibroid volume, there was no evidence of significant differences between groups (in comparisons of control groups with dopamine agonist, raloxifene and ulipristal acetate); however, GnRHa was associated with a greater reduction in volume than either dose of fulvestrant. There was no evidence of differences between groups for other outcomes: preoperative haemoglobin, reduction in bleeding, blood transfusion rates and quality of life. However, GnRHa was more likely to be associated with hot flushes than other medical therapies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPRMs versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>SPRMs were associated with greater reductions in uterine volume (ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) and fibroid volume (ulipristal acetate, mifepristone, CDB2914 and asoprisnil) than placebo pretreatment, and with increased preoperative haemoglobin levels (ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil). Ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil were also associated with a greater reduction in bleeding before surgery than placebo and quality of life was greater with ulipristal acetate pretreatment. There was insufficient evidence to determine rates of adverse events, because these were mostly measured by only one trial.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-27 19:35:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2017 update, the review was expanded from assessment of the role of GnRHa treatment before surgery for uterine fibroids to include all potential medical pretreatments (except for misoprostol which is covered by another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Kongnyuy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kongnyuy 2014</LINK>)). We included other medical treatment options such as SPRMs (asoprisnil, ulipristal acetate, mifepristone or CDB-2914), progestins (lynestrenol), SERMs (raloxifene), dopamine agonists (cabergoline), and oestrogen receptor antagonists (fulvestrant). This update included 38 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 3560 participants but there were multiple comparisons with different types of interventions, which mean that some comparisons were underpowered. Hence, results based on small numbers of participants should be treated with caution. Only 12 of the 38 studies had 100 participants or more.</P>
<P>Participants in the studies all had symptomatic fibroids, with the expectation of surgery, but there was substantial variation among studies in types of fibroids included, size of uterus, degree of anaemia and type of subsequent surgery, limiting the generalisability of the results. Evidence on GnRHa pretreatment was based on a reasonable number of participants but results from other medical pretreatments was based on much smaller numbers of women.</P>
<P>Adverse events were sometimes only anecdotally reported in text format in the included studies but the larger studies mostly provided full tables of individual symptoms associated with pretreatment. Although hyperplasia rates did not differ, the authors of two large trials comparing ulipristal acetate with placebo or GnRHa (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012</LINK>) noted that a spectrum of morphological endometrial changes were associated with three months of treatment with ulipristal acetate (that had been described previously in women receiving SPRM treatment), but these disappeared two months after the end of therapy.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-03 17:50:02 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The quality of the included studies was determined in two ways; risk of bias was assessed for each individual study and an overall quality grading for the body of the evidence was also assessed for each outcome, based on the GRADE criteria: limitations in study design, consistency, indirectness, imprecision and likelihood of publication bias.</P>
<P>Only three of the included studies had low risk of bias for all domains. When summarised as a body of evidence (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), less than half the included studies had low risk of bias for allocation, or blinding of participants and investigators or other potential bias, such as baseline comparability. About 30% had low risk of bias for outcome assessment, and about 50% had low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. The remainder of the included trials had either unclear or high risk of bias for each these domains. A number of the included studies reported receiving pharmaceutical company funding or support; for these studies, it was not possible to determine whether the conflict of interest had influenced the findings.</P>
<P>With respect to overall quality assessment, heterogeneity was substantial for many of the outcomes (particularly those influenced by different hospital policies, participants' uterine size, fibroid type, experience of surgeons etc.). Thus, for many outcomes, pooled estimates could not be calculated and the forest plots display individual estimates for studies, because combining these was not sensible. Imprecision, with findings based on either small trials, low number of events, or with very wide confidence intervals, was also a characteristic of the findings of some outcomes, leading to uncertainties about benefits or harms.</P>
<P>As a result, for most of the primary outcomes reported in the 'Summary of findings' tables, the overall quality of the evidence (using GRADE criteria) was low, with some exceptions. This suggests there are some uncertainties associated with many of the findings in this review.</P>

<P>Efforts were made to retrieve all eligible studies by thorough searching of electronic databases and trials registers. However, the possibility remains that some unpublished studies were not retrieved. Rigorous processes were followed for selection of studies, data extraction and data entry, with efforts undertaken to access missing or unclear data from the publications to ensure accuracy of all data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-28 15:27:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three systematic reviews have evaluated the role of GnRHa preoperatively: before any surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2014</LINK>), before laparoscopic myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>) and before hysteroscopic resection (for submucous fibroids) (<LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2014</LINK>). One systematic review and network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2016</LINK>) provided a more general analysis of the role of medical therapies for fibroids, both before surgery and when used alone. Two analyses have been undertaken to assess the economic effects of ulipristal acetate; one was a cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Nagy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagy 2014</LINK>) and the other a cost minimisation and budget impact analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Zakiyah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakiyah 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of this review broadly reflect the findings of the <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2014</LINK> review which included 26 studies: these were that preoperative GnRHa reduces fibroid volume, increases haemoglobin levels, reduces the chance of a vertical incision, increases the chance of a vaginal procedure, without any increase in postoperative complications. In addition, our review also found a reduction in uterine volume before surgery, a reduction in blood loss (during either hysterectomy or myomectomy), a reduced chance of blood transfusions and postoperative complications (where surgery was hysterectomy). However, GnRHa was associated with an increased risk of adverse events before surgery (in particular, hot flushes). Reduction in intraoperative blood loss when surgery was restricted to laparoscopic myomectomy was also reported in the systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>The systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2014</LINK> included both trials from this review where women underwent hysteroscopic resection for submucous fibroids. <LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2014</LINK> concluded there was insufficient evidence of benefit to support the routine use of GnRHa before resection for this particular indication; this finding mirrors our conclusion.</P>
<P>The network meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2016</LINK> ranked all potential medical treatments before any surgery, according to different outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2016</LINK> found that trials were at high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low. <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2016</LINK> concluded that no medical treatment could currently be recommended before surgery for fibroids without consideration of the relative importance that women ascribe to adverse events and without consideration of cost-effectiveness analyses.</P>
<P>A group of authors from Hungary (<LINK REF="REF-Nagy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagy 2014</LINK>) undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis of ulipristal acetate using a Markov model and based estimates on the findings from Pearl I (<LINK REF="STD-Donnez-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 2012a</LINK>) (a study included in the current review), together with a multicentre cohort study and estimates from an expert panel. <LINK REF="REF-Nagy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagy 2014</LINK> found that adding three months of preoperative ulipristal acetate before surgery rather than immediate hysterectomy resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of EUR 3575 per quality-adjusted life year in women with moderate to severe bleeding as a result of their fibroids. This finding was limited to effects on symptoms. <LINK REF="REF-Nagy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagy 2014</LINK> did not assess the cost-effectiveness of any other preoperative treatment. A cost minimisation analysis was undertaken to compare ulipristal acetate to leuprolide, which was considered the standard of care in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Zakiyah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakiyah 2017</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Zakiyah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakiyah 2017</LINK> concluded that ulipristal acetate was a cost-saving option for preoperative treatment of moderate and severe symptoms of fibroids compared to leuprolide in the short term, with the potential to provide savings on the healthcare budget in the Netherlands.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-04 11:43:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-27 19:56:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the most frequently asked questions in daily practice is whether preoperative treatment actually makes fibroid surgery easier. There is clear evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that preoperative gonadotropin-hormone releasing analogues (GnRHa) can reduce both uterine and fibroid volume and improve haemoglobin levels, although at the expense of increased adverse effects such as hot flushes, before surgery. Rates of vertical incision and blood loss are also reduced (in women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy) and women are more likely to have a vaginal procedure and less likely to have postoperative complications when undergoing hysterectomy. However, there is inadequate evidence to support the use of GnRHa for all women with fibroids undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy. GnRHa could be considered for preoperative use in women with greatly enlarged uteri, preoperative anaemia or where a midline rather than transverse incision was planned. In addition, some women undergoing hysterectomy would benefit from a less invasive vaginal rather than an abdominal procedure. There was insufficient evidence of benefit for other patient or surgical outcomes, such as duration of surgery or hospital stay.</P>
<P>Recent RCTs suggest that ulipristal acetate, an SPRM, may offer another alternative pretreatment to enhance outcomes during and after surgery in women with fibroid-related anaemia, although to date the evidence is based on only two RCTs (both which received pharmaceutical company funding). When compared to GnRHa, ulipristal acetate was not as effective at reducing uterine volume but both pretreatments appeared to have similar effects on other outcomes. These findings will need to be replicated before routine use can be confirmed, with clarification about which women will benefit.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-04 11:43:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Although duration of surgery, total blood loss, postoperative haemoglobin and postoperative complications can be used as surrogates for surgical difficulty, few blinded placebo-controlled data have conclusively measured this outcome and future trials should be both blinded and consider evaluating operative difficulty in a reproducible way.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness data are lacking in all published trials, and given the very significant cost of preoperative agents, some attempt should be made to generate such data in future trials.</P>
<P>The question of whether the chances of fibroid recurrence and women's quality of life is increased after the use of preoperative medical therapy should also be evaluated further in future randomised trials.</P>
