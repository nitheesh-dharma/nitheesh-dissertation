<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-09 10:53:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inferior turbinate (lining of nose) surgery is a commonly performed procedure in ENT as shrinking the lining may reduce some of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, particularly nose blockage. This procedure is carried out using a multitude of techniques including cautery, laser and plasma knife. Although unusual, there is the potential for complications such as excessive bleeding and dry nose from these procedures.</P>
<P>We set out to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of inferior turbinate surgery compared to continued medical treatment in allergic rhinitis patients in whom medical treatment had failed to relieve symptoms. We also looked for RCTs comparing one technique of turbinate surgery with another. Although our search was extensive, we were not able to find any RCTs which met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Research, in the form of properly conducted trials comparing various techniques and assessing long-term results and complications, has not yet been done in this field. We therefore conclude that the evidence in the literature is not robust enough about the usefulness of surgery using any technique for this condition.</P>

<P>Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease that results from an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the nasal mucosa to inhaled allergens. It is primarily treated by allergen avoidance and medical treatment, but when these measures fail to control symptoms then surgery to the inferior turbinates of nose is often performed.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:16:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:16:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease affecting approximately 10% to 20% of the population in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 1991</LINK>). Studies based on questionnaires, objective testing or medical examination indicate that its prevalence is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Aberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 1990</LINK>). Allergic rhinitis is characterised by nasal obstruction, watery nasal discharge, itching and sneezing. Additional associated symptoms include headache, impaired sense of smell and eye irritation. Several other conditions can cause similar symptoms and are referred to as non-allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, diseases including nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis and nasal tumours can also present with similar symptoms.</P>
<P>Allergic rhinitis results from an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the nasal mucosa to inhaled allergens, distinguishing this condition from all the other causes of rhinitis. Typically diagnosis is based on a familial and personal medical history of allergy, the possible presence of lower respiratory tract disease such as asthma, skin symptoms such as eczema, and pollen or food-related allergies. A definitive diagnosis can then be made either with skin prick tests using standardised allergen extract, or by the measurement of allergen specific IgE in the serum by the principle of radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA).</P>
<P>Treatment of allergic rhinitis has been based on guidelines from various panels of experts (International Consensus on Rhinitis, Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Rhinitis, EAACI consensus on Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)) (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plaut-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plaut 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Cauwenberge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cauwenberge 2000</LINK>). Broadly speaking, all these guidelines follow a pattern and consist of 1) allergen avoidance measures, 2) pharmacotherapy (medications) and 3) immunotherapy (desensitisation with allergen-specific serum). Treatment is instituted according to the severity of symptoms. Allergen avoidance measures are recommended in all patients. A graded approach of pharmacotherapy is suggested using oral or topical antihistamines, topical nasal steroids or a combination. Further symptomatic relief may be required for some patients, e.g. ipratropium bromide for watery nasal discharge. Immunotherapy is indicated in patients with a limited spectrum of allergies (one or at the most two clinically relevant allergens) and in whom pharmacotherapy and avoidance measures are insufficient. There is a lack of clarity about the role of surgical intervention in allergic rhinitis in all these guidelines, and in particular the position of inferior turbinate surgery in this condition. In general, it is advocated that if medical treatment fails to relieve nasal obstruction because of hyperplasia or pronounced hypertrophy (enlargement) of the inferior turbinates, a surgical reduction could be performed (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Plaut-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plaut 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Cauwenberge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cauwenberge 2000</LINK>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-24 19:03:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Turbinate reduction surgery is based on the assumption that an increase in nasal airway volume will facilitate better functional nasal airflow, which in turn will produce improvement in patient symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2001</LINK>). Anecdotal evidence from therapeutic trials in the literature illustrates that this common procedure occurs in institutions worldwide, that patients can be children or adults, and that it can be performed in the operating theatre or in outpatient settings by both general otolaryngologists and specialists in rhinology, using different techniques.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-09 10:56:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The narrowest point of the normal nose is the nasal valve, which is bordered by the lower edge of the upper lateral cartilages, the anterior end of the inferior turbinate and the adjacent nasal septum, together with the surrounding soft tissues. This is the main site of nasal resistance to airflow. Nasal blockage could also be due to conditions such as adenoid hypertrophy (in children), a deviated septum, choanal atresia/stenosis (rarely), nasal polyps etc. All these need to be excluded before concluding that the inferior turbinates are the cause. The nasal airway resistance changes according to variation in the bulk of the inferior turbinate; this in turn is determined by cycles of swelling and constriction of the venous sinuses of the inferior turbinate and the nasal septum (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2000</LINK>). The logical conclusion, therefore, is that reducing the bulk of inferior turbinate would, by increasing the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve, reduce nasal resistance and increase nasal airflow. Surgical procedures such as diathermy, cryosurgery and laser ablation produce tissue necrosis, and the ensuing fibrosis causes shrinkage of the soft tissues of the inferior turbinate. On the other hand, turbinectomy procedures (total, partial or endoscopic) reduce the bulk of the bony turbinate with or without the soft tissues covering it. The amount of turbinate reduction achieved varies according to the technique used, with the latter group of procedures usually resulting in a larger reduction.</P>
<P>While turbinate surgery is commonly performed for numerous conditions which cause nasal obstruction (not just allergic rhinitis), there has long been disagreement over its clinical effectiveness in the short and long term. The controversy dates back to the turn of the 20th century. At that time many surgeons advocated total turbinectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1900" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1900</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1895" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1895</LINK>). However, rhinologists soon began to shy away from total and near total turbinate resections due to excessive bleeding, prolonged postoperative crusting and the fear of atrophic rhinitis, a dreaded complication (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1999</LINK>). Partial turbinate surgery became gradually popular among surgeons over the following years (<LINK REF="REF-Courtiss-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtiss 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fry-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1984</LINK>). More recently, surgical techniques to the inferior turbinate seem to have been driven by the availability of newer technology rather than by demonstrable benefits to patients. Whilst rhinologists seem to have their individual preferred technique for turbinate reduction, not all research on turbinate surgery has been positive. <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1985</LINK> evaluated a cohort of patients who underwent total inferior turbinectomy for nasal obstruction after a follow up ranging from three to five years and concluded that complications and morbidity outweighed the benefit and that the procedure "should be condemned". Moreover, publication bias in the literature may result in the under reporting of poor results and of complications.</P>
<P>It has been shown that objective measurements of nasal patency using rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry and peak inspiratory nasal flow measurements do not always correlate with a subject's own assessment of nasal patency (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panagou-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panagou 1998</LINK>). The sensation of nasal airflow probably involves cold receptors in the nasal mucosa and receptors in the skin of the nasal vestibule (<LINK REF="REF-Aldren-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldren 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1989b</LINK>) and therefore improving nasal volume by turbinate surgery may not improve the sensation. Any benefits of inferior turbinate surgery should be weighed against its common complications, including profuse haemorrhage and the attendant cardiovascular risks in the immediate postoperative period, and synechiae (adhesions) and crusting in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-09 10:56:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The success of turbinate surgery in the long term is controversial. The duration of follow up in published studies ranges from six months (<LINK REF="REF-Back-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Back 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2001</LINK>) to many years (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1985</LINK>) and often the results from variable follow ups are combined. Meredith (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1988</LINK>) reported that following electrocautery to the inferior turbinate 31% of patients noted recurrence of nasal obstruction when followed up for more than 33 months.</P>

<P>Patients of any age with unrelieved or partially relieved nasal obstruction after maximal medical treatment of allergic rhinitis. Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis should have been made either with skin prick tests using standardised allergen extract, or by the measurement of allergen specific IgE in the serum by the principle of radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA). We defined maximal medical treatment as instituting a combination of both antihistamines and nasal steroids, or immunotherapy, in addition to allergen avoidance measures in all the patients. The above measures must have been continued for at least a few weeks. We excluded studies with mixed groups, i.e. where some participants did not have either of the tests above, unless the details of individual patients could be extracted from the article or obtained from the authors.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Allergic rhinitis affects 10% to 20% of the population and causes distressing symptoms that affect their quality of life. Medical treatment is effective in many, however a significant group remain with partially controlled symptoms and request further help, particularly for relief of nasal blockage. Inferior turbinate surgery is commonly performed worldwide in the belief that a reduction in the size of turbinates will result in long-lasting improvement in nasal breathing. The number and types of procedures to the inferior turbinates have mushroomed over the years and seem to be driven by the adoption of newer technologies rather than firm evidence that any of these procedures are beneficial for the patient. Moreover, these procedures could potentially result in complications, for example haemorrhage and atrophic rhinitis. Therefore, it was imperative to address the issue with a systematic review of the literature that would justify embarking on these procedures.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-22 10:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies of inferior turbinate surgery conducted to date generate insufficient evidence for several reasons: 1) combining of allergic and non-allergic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Joniau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joniau 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wojdas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojdas 2004</LINK>), 2) non-randomised distribution of patients to groups (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2003</LINK>), 3) failure to use stringent criteria for patient selection and allocation into groups (<LINK REF="REF-Kunachak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunachak 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papadakis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadakis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passali-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passali 2003</LINK>) and 4) poor long-term follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Csoma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Csoma 2004</LINK>). Although many studies seemed to show good surgical outcomes, they had to be excluded due to poor quality. This review therefore has to conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any form of surgical intervention to the inferior turbinates in patients with allergic rhinitis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-08-24 19:27:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the absence of evidence that inferior turbinate surgery is an effective tool for allergic rhinitis, these interventions are not recommended for routine use until such corroborative research becomes available.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-08-24 19:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We could not reach clinically useful conclusions due to the lack of quality of studies in the literature. There appears to be a tendency to pool patients with apparent enlargement/hypertrophy of inferior turbinates into a single group and to institute the intervention despite the obvious fact that the cause of turbinate hypertrophy is multifactorial. Studies were often wound up too early or did not last long enough to reach any meaningful conclusion regarding long-term outcomes. Randomisation processes were poor even in the relatively better research papers.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-08-24 19:30:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used an extensive search strategy to identify studies for this review which incorporated more than 14 databases. We applied no language or publication restrictions and the searches are up to date to July 2010. While it is possible that relevant studies could have been missed, this is unlikely.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-09-08 05:53:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jemy Jose">
<P>Inferior turbinate surgery is commonly performed after failed medical treatment for allergic rhinitis. In the absence of evidence in the literature with regard to its effectiveness, particularly long-term results and complications, one needs to be cautious about selecting this procedure until such evidence becomes available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-24 19:31:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the need for randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of inferior turbinate surgery for nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment. Future trials needs to be rigorous in design and delivery, separate adults from paediatric patients, not combine allergic with non-allergic patients and last long enough to determine lasting results and complications.</P>
