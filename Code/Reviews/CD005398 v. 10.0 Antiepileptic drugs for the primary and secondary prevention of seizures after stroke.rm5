<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-14 15:47:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Seizures (epileptic attacks) after stroke are a major clinical problem. It is unclear whether antiepileptic drugs are effective in preventing seizures after stroke in adults. This review searched in August 2013 for high quality evidence to help clarify this problem. We found only one high quality clinical trial that looked at whether antiepileptic drugs may be more effective than placebo in preventing seizures after stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The only study that was included in this review was <A HREF="Gilad 2011">Gilad 2011</A>. This was a prospective randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial studying the efficacy of valproic acid versus placebo in the primary prevention of seizure in 72 adults (over 18 years of age) with spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Patients were randomly allocated to either the treatment or the placebo group with active treatment lasting one month; the primary outcome was seizure occurrence at one year. People with very early seizures (within 24 hours of onset of haemorrhage) were excluded from the study. Seizure was diagnosed on the basis of eye-witness evidence from staff, relatives or other eye witnesses.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Of The Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There does not appear to be bias in <A HREF="Gilad 2011">Gilad 2011</A>, on the basis of the information available within the study.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="Gilad 2011">Gilad 2011</A> did not show a statistically significant benefit when comparing valproic acid with placebo for the primary prevention of seizures after spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Currently, therefore, there is not enough evidence to justify the routine use of antiepileptic drugs to prevent seizures after stroke (evidence current to 08/2013). Further research is needed for this important clinical problem.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-15 14:52:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is a major health problem in both the developed and developing world. In industrialised countries, it is the third most common cause of death after ischaemic heart disease and cancers, and almost half of all stroke survivors are left with a permanent handicap (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1991</LINK>). Stroke mainly affects the older generation, although about 25% of all strokes occur in people under the age of 65, and about 1% in people under the age of 30.</P>
<P>Cerebrovascular disease is the most commonly identified cause of acquired epilepsy. Post-stroke seizures account for 11% of all epilepsy, 22% of all cases of status epilepticus, and 55% of newly diagnosed seizures amongst older people (<LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeLorenzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeLorenzo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herman 2002</LINK>). The reported incidence of post-stroke seizures varies widely between epidemiological studies, ranging from 2% to 33% for early seizures (within the first 14 days) and 3% to 67% for later seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>). This is mainly due to the varying methods of case ascertainment and definitions used in relation to the timing of post-stroke seizures. According to epidemiological guidelines developed by the International League Against Epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1981</LINK>) seizures occurring within the first week of stroke are defined as 'early seizures', and those occurring after the first week are defined as 'late seizures'. Using this definition, approximately 2% to 6% of people with stroke suffer early seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Lamy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-So-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">So 1996</LINK>), and 3% to 5% suffer late seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Lamy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-So-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">So 1996</LINK>). In the longer term, one community-based study found that the cumulative actuarial risk of having a post-stroke seizure was 4.2% at one year and 11.5% at five years (<LINK REF="REF-Burn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burn 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Development of late seizures is more common in people who have experienced early seizures (risk of about 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Kilpatrick-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilpatrick 1990</LINK>)). Moreover, development of post-stroke epilepsy (that is, recurrent seizures) is more common in people who have experienced late seizures, with a risk of about 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2001</LINK>), than for those with early seizures where the risk is about 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sung-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sung 1990</LINK>). Possible risk factors for post-stroke seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Burn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinton 1988</LINK>) include the following:</P>
<P>(1) stroke subtype: cerebral haemorrhage (especially subarachnoid haemorrhage);</P>
<P>(2) location of the lesion: cortical involvement, stroke occurring within the carotid artery territory;</P>
<P>(3) stroke severity (but correlation may be weaker after adjusting for stroke subtype and location);</P>
<P>(4) occurrence of post-stroke bacterial infections.</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of early and late post-stroke seizures is believed to be different. In the first few days following an ischaemic brain lesion, cellular biochemical dysfunction can lead to cortical excitability and seizure activity (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2002</LINK>). Acute ischaemia leads to a massive release of glutamate, causing excessive activation of glutamate receptors. This process is believed to be responsible for secondary neuronal injury and epileptogenesis in ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>). Within the ischaemic penumbra, a mixed population of dead, dying, and surviving neurones can become the underlying substrate for ischaemia-induced epileptogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2002</LINK>). In contrast, late seizures may be caused by development of gliosis and meningocerebral cicatrices, with changes in membrane properties, deafferentation, selective neuronal loss, and collateral sprouting (<LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>). This can result in cortical hyperexcitability and neuronal synchrony sufficient to cause seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relationship between post-stroke seizures and outcome remains unclear. Several studies have found that post-stroke seizures may predict worse functional outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Menon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menon 2009</LINK>), but many of these studies have not adjusted for important covariates such as stroke severity (<LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>). One large study (<LINK REF="REF-Labovitz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labovitz 2001</LINK>) showed that, before adjusting for stroke severity, occurrence of early post-stroke seizures increased the risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 12.5). However, after adjusting for stroke severity using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, this association was not statistically significant (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.6 to 7.1). In another large community-based study, early post-stroke seizures actually predicted a better neurological outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Reith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1997</LINK>). There is also some evidence that post-stroke seizures may significantly affect health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Leidy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leidy 1999</LINK>) but a large prospective study did not find any adverse effect on rehabilitation outcome as measured by the Barthel Index or the Rivermead Mobility Index (<LINK REF="REF-Paolucci-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paolucci 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, it is unclear whether antiepileptic drugs should be routinely prescribed for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-08-15 14:52:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to assess the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke.</P>
<P>(1) For the question of primary prevention, we aimed to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in people who have had a stroke but have not had a seizure.</P>
<P>(2) For the question of secondary prevention, we aimed to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in people who have had a stroke and at least one post-stroke seizure.</P>

<P>We used the World Health Organization definition of stroke for this review (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>). We considered all studies that recruited participants with a new neurological deficit consistent with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. We considered studies that included participants with either ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, but we excluded studies that only recruited participants with subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, or other non-stroke diagnoses such as tumour- or infection-related infarction or haemorrhage. We also excluded studies that recruited only participants who had undergone any type of neurosurgery. The management of these excluded patient groups is likely to be substantially different from the generality of people with stroke. For studies which have reported the results for a mixture of participant groups, we attempted to separate them and identify those which were relevant to the participant groups of interest. When we found that this was not possible, we excluded the studies. We included participants of all ages suffering any seizure type.</P>

Of these, we obtained full-text paper copies for six completed studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Sabin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Sabin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pulsinelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pulsinelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tietjen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tietjen 1996</LINK>) and one ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00542802" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00542802</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the 2013 update of this review, we requested the full text of four further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Consoli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Consoli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mess_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Messé 2009</LINK>;<U> </U>

<P>We excluded all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2011</LINK> as they did not meet our review inclusion criteria. Please see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for details of why each study was excluded. In summary, two studies did not assess the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of post-stroke seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Pulsinelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pulsinelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tietjen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tietjen 1996</LINK>); five studies did not have a placebo/control group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Sabin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Sabin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mess_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Messé 2009</LINK>); three studies were not randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Sabin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Sabin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mess_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Messé 2009</LINK>); and two studies evaluated not only stroke patients but also other causes of epileptic attacks (<LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK>). However, in both of these studies, there was no placebo/control group and we could not separate or extract the data for the stroke subgroup. One study failed to recruit enough participants due to problems with the execution of the trial, and we could therefore draw no conclusion about the ability of the trial drug to prevent post-stroke seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Tuijl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Van Tuijl 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Consoli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Consoli 2012</LINK> reports on the results of the ongoing study <LINK REF="STD-NCT00542802" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00542802</LINK>. For the purposes of this review we have added it as an excluded study; however we may report on it narratively in the next update of this review.</P>
<P>The only study that was included in this review was <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2011</LINK>. This was a prospective randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial studying the efficacy of valproic acid versus placebo in the primary prevention of seizure in 72 adults (over 18 years of age) with spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The study included patients consecutively admitted to a neurological centre. They were then randomly allocated to either the treatment or the placebo group with active treatment lasting one month; the primary outcome was seizure occurrence at one year. People with very early seizures (within 24 hours of onset of haemorrhage) were excluded from the study. Seizure was diagnosed on the basis of eye-witness evidence from staff, relatives or other eye witnesses.</P>
<P>The methodology of six of the studies excluded from this review deserve more detailed description because of their relevance (please see the findings of these studies in <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>):</P>
<P>(1) <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK> was an 18-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel study of 593 participants over 60 years of age with newly diagnosed seizures ("geriatric epilepsy"). A minimum of one seizure during the three months preceding enrolment was required. Participants were randomised to gabapentin, lamotrigine or carbamazepine. There was no placebo/control group. The primary outcome measure was retention in the trial for 12 months. Secondary endpoints included seizure freedom at 12 months, time to first seizure and drug toxicity. Cerebral infarction was recorded as the most common primary aetiology of the seizures (29.9%) followed by arteriosclerosis (15%). There were no data on cerebral haemorrhage. A large majority of the study participants had evidence of underlying vascular disease with diagnoses of hypertension (391/593; 65.9%), stroke (302/593; 50.9%) and cardiac disease (286/593; 48.2%). Participants had multiple medical conditions and were on an average of seven other medications.</P>
<P>(2) <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK> was an unblinded randomised controlled trial in hospital-based outpatient clinics in the United Kingdom (UK). Arm A recruited 1721 participants for whom carbamazepine was deemed to be standard treatment, and they were randomly assigned to receive carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Participants over the age of four were recruited, and 108 participants (6.3%) had a history of stroke or cerebrovascular disease (with no data on proportions of cerebral infarct or haemorrhage). There was no placebo/control group. Primary outcomes were the time from randomisation to treatment failure (i.e. stopping the randomised drug due either to inadequate seizure control or to intolerable side-effects, or both, or the addition of other antiepileptic drugs, whichever was the earliest); and the time from randomisation to the achievement of a one-year period of remission of seizures. Quality of life and health economics were also assessed. Assessment was by both intention-to-treat and per protocol.</P>
<P>(3) <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK> studied the use of lamotrigine monotherapy versus carbamazepine for people with post-stroke seizure. They included 64 participants with ischaemic stroke in their study, and these were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either lamotrigine or carbamazepine monotherapy. Only those participants with a middle cerebral artery distribution stroke on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. They were followed up prospectively for 12 months. Participants with status epilepticus or more than two seizures within the first 24 hours were excluded from the study (two participants). The primary endpoint of the study was a second seizure or reaching the end of the 12-month follow-up without seizures. The tolerability of the study medications was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Limitations of the study are that there was no placebo/control group, participant numbers were small, the study was not double-blinded and participants with seizures within the first 24 hours were excluded.</P>
<P>(4) <LINK REF="STD-Daniele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 2005</LINK> studied the use of levetiracetam monotherapy for treating early post-stroke seizures. They included 54 participants in their study, with 34 participants (29 with ischaemic and 5 with haemorrhagic stroke) receiving levetiracetam and 20 participants as controls. It is unclear how the participants were selected and what treatments the control group received. Participants were followed up for a period of 12 months. The participants were not randomised, the study was not blinded, and participant numbers were small.</P>
<P>(5) <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Sabin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Sabin 2002</LINK> studied the long-term efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in 71 prospective participants (48 with ischaemic and 23 with haemorrhagic stroke) with a first post-stroke seizure. Participants were followed up for at least a year with a mean follow-up time of 30 months. The participants were not randomised, there was no placebo/control group, and participant numbers were small.</P>
<P>6) <LINK REF="STD-Mess_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Messé 2009</LINK> studied whether giving people who had sustained intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) a novel neuroprotective medication (AED) early was associated with poor outcome at day 90 - defined as a modified Rankin Score of five (severely disabled) or six (dead). Data were analysed from the placebo arm only of the Cerebral Hemorrhage and NXY-059 Trial (CHANT). CHANT was an international multicentre randomised trial that enrolled participants over the age of 18 within six hours of the onset of acute ICH. Three hundred and three participants were entered into the placebo arm of this trial: eight were excluded as they were already on AEDs. As only one arm of this trial was studied, participants in this subanalysis were not randomised and there was no control group.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2011</LINK> included only 72 participants. This small sample size may introduce bias to the results, although this will have been minimised by the randomisation process.</P>
<P>Seizures were diagnosed on the basis of eye-witness evidence. There was no continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring during this study; EEG was only done if definite seizures were observed, or if the diagnosis of seizure was in doubt (unexplained confusion, depressed mental status). Therefore, some seizure activity may have gone unnoticed.</P>
<P>In addition, the study excluded participants who experienced seizure within 24 hours of onset of intracranial haemorrhage. The group studied may therefore have been those at lower risk of seizures than those excluded, which could potentially have given falsely optimistic results in terms of seizure prevention at one year and in the secondary outcome of improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at one year.</P>
<P>Participants in the placebo group were treated with an anticonvulsant if they experienced a seizure. No comment is made in the study about whether participants in the treatment group were also given an increased dose or additional anticonvulsant if they experienced seizure. If both groups of participants experiencing seizures did receive anticonvulsants, this is a potential source of bias.</P>
<P>However, best medical practice is to treat seizures if they were recurrent or did not quickly self terminate. There would be ethical implications in not doing this for both groups regardless of their study status.</P>
<P>Based on the analysis included in the risk of bias table (below) there is a low risk of bias in this study on the basis of the information available.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2011</LINK> found that of 84 participants initially included, five suffered immediate seizures and seven were lost to follow-up. Therefore, 72 participants completed the study, 36 in each arm. There was no statistically significant difference between the group receiving valproic acid and that receiving placebo in terms of demographics, co-morbidities or the primary outcome of seizure occurrence at one year. There was a non-statistically significant reduction in early seizures (less than 14 days after onset of haemorrhage) in the treatment group compared to placebo. There was a statistically significant benefit in the secondary outcome of NIHSS score at one year in the valproic acid group compared to the placebo group (treatment group 4.4 &#8723; 4.1, placebo group 8.6 &#8723; 6.1, P = 0.002).</P>
<P>The results of six of the excluded studies are mentioned because of their relevance to this area (please see the methodologies for these studies in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>):</P>
<P>(1) <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK> found that of the 590 participants enrolled and not terminated due to administrative reasons, 276 (46.8%) completed one year in the trial. Tolerability of the three drugs was however different. There were more early terminators in the carbamazepine group (64.5%) than in the groups taking lamotrigine (44.3%) or gabapentin 51% (P = 0.0002)<I>. </I>In paired-group comparisons carbamazepine had more early terminators than either gabapentin (P = 0.008) or lamotrigine (P &lt; 0.0001). Few participants terminated the study due to uncontrolled seizures and there were no differences between the three groups. The majority of the participants in the carbamazepine group left the study due to adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity (rash of any degree) was more frequent with carbamazepine than with lamotrigine (P = 0.007). Six of the seven participants hospitalised for hypersensitivity reactions were in the carbamazepine group. Hyponatraemia was also more common in the carbamazepine group. Gabapentin participants were significantly more likely to gain weight over the first 12 months than those on carbamazepine (P = 0.002) or lamotrigine (P = 0.001). Water retention was also significantly greater with gabapentin than with carbamazepine (P = 0.004) or lamotrigine (P = 0.02).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in the seizure-free rate at 3, 6 and 12 months between the three groups. Seizure-free rates were 63.2% at three months (lamotrigine 63.1%, gabapentin 62.2%, carbamazepine 64.8%; P = 0.93), 58.6% at six months (lamotrigine 56.6%, gabapentin 56.6%, carbamazepine 64.8%; P = 0.39) and 53.3% at 12 months (lamotrigine 51.4%, gabapentin 56.6%, carbamazepine 64.3%; P = 0.09). When seizures occurring during the six-week period of drug titration are excluded, 63.4% of participants were seizure-free at 12 months (lamotrigine 61.3%, gabapentin 60%, carbamazepine 71.4%; P = 0.27). There were no significant differences in time to first, second, fifth and tenth seizures between the three groups. When looking at seizure-free retention, participants on lamotrigine did better at three and six months after seizures occurring during the six-week titration period were excluded. However, the differences at 12 months were not significant (overall P value = 0.16).</P>
<P>(2) <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK>: for time to treatment failure, lamotrigine was significantly better than carbamazepine, gabapentin and topiramate, and had a non-significant advantage compared with oxcarbazepine. For time to 12-month remission, carbamazepine was significantly better than gabapentin, and a non-significant advantage for carbamazepine against lamotrigine, topiramate and oxcarbazepine was observed. Longer-term per protocol analyses at two and four years demonstrated non-inferiority of lamotrigine compared with carbamazepine in the proportion of people achieving a 12-month remission. Around half of all participants reported adverse events at some point in the study. For the intention-to-treat population, lamotrigine was the drug with the least number of participants reporting adverse events (45% intention-to-treat, 37% per protocol) and topiramate the most (53% intention-to-treat, 49% per protocol). There were no significant differences in the quality of life between the five groups. The authors concluded that lamotrigine is clinically better than carbamazepine for time-to-treatment-failure outcomes and was therefore a cost-effective alternative for people diagnosed with partial onset seizures.</P>
<P>(3) <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK> found that more participants in the lamotrigine group were seizure-free (72%) versus those in the carbamazepine group (44%; P = 0.06). Significantly fewer participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events in the lamotrigine group (3%) compared with the carbamazepine group (31%; P = 0.02).</P>
<P>(4) <LINK REF="STD-Daniele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 2005</LINK> observed the recurrence of seizures in two (5.8%) of the 34 participants treated with levetiracetam compared with three (15%) of the 20 participants in the control group.</P>
<P>(5) <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Sabin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Sabin 2002</LINK> showed that 13 (18.3%) of the participants treated with gabapentin experienced one or more seizures during follow-up. Gabapentin treatment was discontinued in two people due to inadequate seizure control. Side effects were recorded in 27 cases (38%). The most common side effects were drowsiness (17%), dizziness (14%), headache and fatigue (7%), and nausea and vomiting (6%). Only two participants withdrew from the study due to drug side effects.</P>
<P>6) <LINK REF="STD-Mess_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Messé 2009</LINK> defined poor outcome at day 90 as a modified Rankin Scale score of five or six (severely disabled or dead). Eighty-two participants (28%) had a poor outcome at day 90; early initiation of AEDs was significantly associated with poor outcome after adjustment for other known predictors of outcome after intracranial haemorrhage (age, initial haematoma volume, presence of intraventricular blood, initial Glasgow coma score, and prior warfarin use).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-14 16:21:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to assess the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke. Using our review criteria, only one of the selected studies could be included for further analysis. This study of 72 participants did not produce a statistically significant result when comparing valproic acid with placebo for the primary prevention of seizures after spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the treatment group had a lower, non-statistically significant incidence of early seizures (less than 14 days after onset of haemorrhage) compared to the placebo group. The valproic acid treatment group also demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in the secondary outcome of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at one year compared to the placebo group. This supports the hypothesis of a neuroprotective/neuro-remodelling effect of valproic acid. Whether these results can be translated to apply to other forms of stroke (e.g. ischaemic, subarachnoid haemorrhage) is not certain.</P>
<P>We did, however, find three interesting randomised controlled trials comparing a number of different AEDs. One study was performed in older adults (mean age 72 years) with a mixture of diagnoses including stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>); another study was performed in children and younger adults with a mixture of diagnoses including stroke (<LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK>); and the last study was performed in people with stroke only (<LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>). The findings from these three studies suggest that lamotrigine may be a clinically more useful AED than carbamazepine, but this finding cannot be generalised to the post-stroke population as a whole. Results from the non-randomised <LINK REF="STD-Daniele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 2005</LINK> also suggest that it may be worth evaluating levetiracetam in future randomised controlled trials of seizures after stroke.</P>
<P>The management of post-stroke seizures therefore remains controversial. One observational study reported that during a four-year follow-up period half of all people who received AEDs after a first post-stroke seizure had at least one seizure relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>). European guidelines recommend the use of AEDs to prevent recurrent seizures after stroke but prophylactic administration to people with stroke who have not experienced a seizure is not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-EUSI-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUSI 2003</LINK>). American guidelines are less precise, simply stating that: "there are no data about the utility of prophylactic administration of AEDs after stroke".</P>
<P>Due to the lack of trial evidence on the efficacy of AEDs in the treatment of post-stroke seizures, clinical guidelines are often based on the established management of seizures that may complicate any acute neurological illness (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2003</LINK>). Some other experts go further and recommend that early and late post-stroke seizures should receive long-term prophylactic treatment with AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-Asconape-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asconape 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camilo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilo 2004</LINK>). In some countries such as the United Kingdom, sodium valproate remains a very popular AED for the treatment of post-stroke seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Stephen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephen 2003</LINK>), although there is no conclusive evidence to support this practice (<LINK REF="STD-SANAD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neurologists and stroke physicians will probably continue to struggle with the question of whether one isolated post-stroke seizure (especially an early seizure) requires immediate treatment with AEDs, and if so, which drug(s) should be initiated, at what dosage, and for how long. Many clinicians would agree that repeated unprovoked post-stroke seizures probably require treatment with AEDs, but again there is no good evidence to inform which drug(s) should be initiated, at what dosage, and for how long.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is some evidence that there may be potential risks with using AEDs in the post-stroke recovery period. For example, there are concerns that the use of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines in the post-stroke period may adversely affect motor recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1990</LINK>).</P>
