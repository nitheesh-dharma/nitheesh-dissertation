<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, results in narrowing and blockage of the arteries and can reduce the blood supply to the legs, causing peripheral arterial disease. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles that is brought on by walking and is relieved by standing still or resting. Pentoxifylline is a drug that is used to relieve IC while improving people's walking capacity. It decreases blood viscosity and improves red blood cell flexibility, promoting microcirculatory blood flow and increasing oxygen in the tissues. This review looked at all available evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficiency of pentoxifylline for treatment of IC.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review included 24 studies with 3377 participants (current until April 2015). Seventeen studies compared pentoxifylline with placebo, and the remaining studies compared pentoxifylline with flunarizine (one study), aspirin (one study), Gingko biloba extract (one study), nylidrin hydrochloride (one study), prostaglandin E1 (two studies) and buflomedil and nifedipine (one study). Large differences between included studies in how investigators measured and reported study findings made it impossible to combine results.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies suggested mild to moderate improvement in pain-free walking distance and total walking distance for pentoxifylline over placebo (and other treatments, which included Gingko biloba, buflomedil, iloprost, nylidrin, aspirin and prostaglandin E1). The statistical significance of findings from individual trials was unclear, and researchers observed large variability between studies in the effects of pentoxifylline. The most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea, and the drug was well tolerated.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of included studies was generally low, and very large variability between studies was noted in reported findings including duration of trials, doses of pentoxifylline and distances participants could walk at the start of trials. Most included studies did not report on randomisation techniques or how treatment allocation was concealed, did not provide adequate information to permit judgement of selective reporting and did not report blinding of outcome assessors. Given all these factors, the role of pentoxifylline in intermittent claudication remains uncertain, although this medication was generally well tolerated by participants.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:46:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pentoxifylline, one of many drugs used to treat IC, acts by decreasing blood viscosity, improving erythrocyte flexibility and promoting microcirculatory flow and tissue oxygen concentration. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of pentoxifylline in treating individuals with PAD, but results of these studies are variable. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.</P>

<P>Two review authors separately assessed included studies,. matched data and resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors assessed the methodological quality of studies by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and collected results related to pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and total walking distance (TWD). Comparison of studies was based on duration and dose of pentoxifylline.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:46:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review 24 studies with 3377 participants. Seventeen studies compared pentoxifylline versus placebo. In the seven remaining studies, pentoxifylline was compared with flunarizine (one study), aspirin (one study), Gingko biloba extract (one study), nylidrin hydrochloride (one study), prostaglandin E1 (two studies) and buflomedil and nifedipine (one study). The quality of the evidence was generally low, with large variability in reported findings.. Most included studies did not report on random sequence generation and allocation concealment, did not provide adequate information to allow selective reporting to be judged and did not report blinding of assessors. Heterogeneity between included studies was considerable with regards to multiple variables, including duration of treatment, dose of pentoxifylline, baseline walking distance and participant characteristics; therefore, pooled analysis was not possible.</P>
<P>Of 17 studies comparing pentoxifylline with placebo, 14 reported TWD and 11 reported PFWD; the difference in percentage improvement in TWD for pentoxifylline over placebo ranged from 1.2% to 155.9%, and in PFWD from -33.8% to 73.9%. Testing the statistical significance of these results generally was not possible because data were insufficient. Most included studies suggested improvement in PFWD and TWD for pentoxifylline over placebo and other treatments, but the statistical and clinical significance of findings from individual trials is unclear. Pentoxifylline generally was well tolerated; the most commonly reported side effects consisted of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:46:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the generally poor quality of published studies and the large degree of heterogeneity evident in interventions and in results, the overall benefit of pentoxifylline for patients with Fontaine class II intermittent claudication remains uncertain. Pentoxifylline was shown to be generally well tolerated.</P>
<P>Based on total available evidence, high-quality data are currently insufficient to reveal the benefits of pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is a cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles that is brought on by walking, is relieved by rest and is a result of reduced circulation (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). Intermittent claudication is a common presentation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) caused by atherosclerosis. From 2000 to 2010, the number of people living with PAD increased across all age groups by a mean of 23.51% (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>). These data include high-income countries, as well as low- and middle-income countries. Peripheral arterial disease is a progressive disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The main cause of mortality is associated cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease. Patients with IC have reduced quality of life and increased risks of stroke and myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary health care plays an important role in the treatment of individuals with intermittent claudication. First steps in treating IC include conservative risk factor control, exercise therapy and pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Tendera-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tendera 2011</LINK>). Revascularisation intervention, in the form of open or endovascular surgery, is usually reserved for incapacitating disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bachoo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachoo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1998</LINK>). In one study, 63% of newly diagnosed claudicants were treated by general practitioners with lifestyle advice or drugs, or both; only 37% required referral to hospital specialists (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 2002</LINK>). Understanding treatment options and their effectiveness is vital for controlling the disease at an early stage and preventing its progression.</P>
<P>Different types of medications have been used for treatment of IC. Vasodilators and antiplatelets reduce the chance of blood clots at the blockage site (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2011)</LINK>; other drugs help reduce the symptoms of claudication, improve walking distance and reduce disability associated with the condition (<LINK REF="REF-de-Backer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Backer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Backer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Backer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:49:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pentoxifylline is a vasoactive drug that has been authorised for the medical treatment of individuals with IC. Pentoxifylline decreases blood viscosity, improves erythrocyte flexibility and promotes microcirculatory flow, while increasing tissue oxygen concentration. It is a methylxanthine derivative that works by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase and by potentiating the effects of endogenous prostacyclin, a prostaglandin that possesses anti-aggregatory, fibrinolytic (decreased fibrinogen concentrations) and vasodilatory properties and increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in red blood cells, platelets and arterial cell walls (<LINK REF="REF-Micromedex-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micromedex 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication is a marker of increased morbidity and mortality, and treating symptoms is becoming ever more important with the increased prevalence of PAD. Previous studies and reviews have evaluated the efficacy of pentoxifylline in the treatment of IC and peripheral vascular disease, compared with other treatment options including other pharmacological interventions and exercise, yielding variable results (<LINK REF="REF-Bedenis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedenis 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2012</LINK>). Continued evaluation of pentoxifylline through evidence-based systematic reviews will result in improved understanding of available pharmacological interventions for IC.</P>
<P>Recently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended naftidrofuryl oxalate as the leading pharmacological treatment for IC on studies of effectiveness and costs (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In this review, we will not address cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>In a large multi-centre study, <LINK REF="STD-Creager-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Creager 2008</LINK> compared pentoxifylline versus placebo (and vs various doses of iloprost) over six months. In this study, 430 participants were randomly assigned to five groups: iloprost 50 g (87 participants), iloprost 100 g (86 participants), iloprost 150 g (87 participants), pentoxifylline 1200 mg (86 participants) and placebo (84 participants). Only 214 participants (&#8776; 50%) completed the entire six months of the study. Three hundred seventy participants were included in what was called an intention-to-treat analysis on the basis that they had received at least one dose of the study drug and had undergone at least one follow-up test, that is, within two to four weeks. Walking distance in the pentoxifylline group improved by 34.3% from a baseline PFWD of 118 m compared with a 21.2% improvement in the placebo group from a baseline PFWD of 120 m. Overall, pentoxifylline improved PFWD by 13.1% more than placebo, but this difference could not be analysed statistically because data were insufficient. Study authors reported that after one month, the difference between groups was statistically significant, but P values for significance results were not provided.</P>

As was done for PFWD, TWD was reported as percentage change in mean TWD from baseline to end of study for pentoxifylline and placebo groups separately, and as the difference in percentage change between groups. Again, data on mean change in TWD and standard deviation of the change were required to compare improvement in TWD between groups. In all 14 included studies, trial authors failed to report the standard deviation of the percentage change in mean TWD, so a statistical analysis could not be performed.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:48:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and poor quality of life. It reflects the presence of an underlying disease process that results in narrowing or maybe blockage of lower limb blood vessels. It is associated with the presence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the vascular tree, especially in the coronary and cerebral circulations.</P>
<P>As this pathology cannot be reversed, the main aims of treatment are (1) to stop or slow progression of the disease to critical ischaemia, to prevent adverse events, and (2) to alleviate the severity of symptoms to improve quality of life.</P>
<P>It is widely accepted, although at times controversial, that treatment of PAD at the stage of IC is medical, and that revascularisation is not the treatment of choice. Large numbers of interventions have been developed. Lifestyle changes and exercise are the basic essential interventions; they have a significant effect on both disease progression and symptoms. Other essential drugs like statins are very important for slowing the disease but have little effect on the symptoms. Pentoxifylline is one of many drugs used to relieve symptoms of IC and to improve quality of life.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In comparing pentoxifylline with placebo, 11 studies reported pain-free walking distance (PFWD). The duration of studies ranged from four to 40 weeks, and the pentoxifylline dose from 600 mg to 1600 mg. Baseline PFWD ranged from 27.1 m to 460 m, with large variability in results. One study reported less improvement in PFWD over the duration of the trial in the pentoxifylline group than in the placebo group - with a difference as great as 33.8%. On the other hand, maximum improvement in PFWD among participants receiving pentoxifylline was 73.9% more than in those given placebo.</P>
<P>A total of 14 studies reported total walking distance (TWD) as an outcome when comparing pentoxifylline versus placebo. Studies varied in duration from eight weeks to 52 weeks, and pentoxifylline dose from 400 mg to 1800 mg, but most studies used 1200 mg. Baseline TWD ranged from 56 m to 678 m, and for PFWD, results were highly variable. The minimum benefit of pentoxifylline shown was 1%, and the maximum benefit was 155.9%.</P>
<P>In one study, pentoxifylline showed greater improvement in PFWD when compared with Gingko biloba extract (GBE), buflomedil and iloprost; cilostazol showed greater improvement when compared with pentoxifylline; and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) showed greater improvement when compared with pentoxifylline. Data from the second study, which evaluated PGE1 and pentoxifylline, are too limited to allow meaningful conclusions. For TWD, greater improvement was shown for pentoxifylline than for nylidrin, GBE and aspirin, and for cilostazol and flunarizine than for pentoxifylline. PGE1 showed greater improvement in TWD in one study, and data in the second study are currently too limited to permit meaningful conclusions.</P>
<P>Pentoxifylline appeared to be well tolerated in most studies, with gastrointestinal side effects, mainly nausea, reported most commonly. These effects appeared mild.</P>
<P>Most included studies suggested improvement in PFWD and TWD for pentoxifylline over placebo (and other treatments), but the statistical significance of findings from individual trials is unclear, and pentoxifylline showed no improvement in ABI. It is important to appreciate the difference between statistical significance and clinical significance; even when a statistically significant improvement is described, improvement of a few metres might not make much difference to a patient.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows great variability between trial outcomes with pentoxifylline treatment. This helps to explain the large number of studies of pentoxifylline for IC that have been performed over three decades. Positive results in some studies were often only marginal, and across studies were generally inconsistent, encouraging further research to attain consistency.</P>
<P>Large variability in the results of studies included in this review was not unexpected. These studies used different doses of pentoxifylline, over variable durations, in different countries and by various study designs, but the variety of participant characteristics is most important. Investigators stated that they included individuals with IC Fontaine class II, but baseline walking distance varied from 27.1 m to 460 m for PFWD, and from 56 m to 678 m for TWD. This suggests considerable variation in the characteristics of participant groups across studies. Most researchers stated that baseline variables were comparable between intervention and control groups but did not specify these variables.</P>
<P>Only two studies reported use of an exercise programme in addition to pentoxifylline or comparison treatments. The remaining studies did not report an exercise programme or indicated that no formal programme was used. Some studies advised participants to stop smoking for the duration of the study. Advice on exercise and smoking appears inconsistent between studies, and effects of this on overall outcomes and placebo effects are unknown.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We judged the overall quality of the evidence to be low. For most included studies, the risk of bias is unclear, mainly because insufficient information is available to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This was the case for selection bias, blinding, detection bias in particular, attrition bias and bias due to selective reporting.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence is severely limited by the heterogeneity of included studies. Study duration varied from four weeks to 52 weeks. Pentoxifylline doses used for the intervention group varied. Most studies used 1200 mg, but doses from 400 mg to 1800 mg were reported. Variability in outcomes was evident in that studies assessed PFWD, TWD or both. In addition, different treadmill protocols that ranged from constant load tests to graded tests were used to measure PFWD and TWD. Some studies did not report the treadmill protocol used. PFWD and TWD were reported as means, geometric means, seconds to percentage change from baseline and ratios. Thus we could not perform a pooled analysis. </P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, we identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pentoxifylline versus placebo or other pharmacological interventions. Open, cohort and single-blinded studies were not included because pentoxifylline has been studied extensively, and research authors identified a considerable number of RCTs. Comparisons of lifestyle changes and exercise were not included because no evidence has supported their inclusion in any treatment plan. As IC is a long-term condition, we included studies with a minimum duration of four weeks. We believe our search for RCTs has been comprehensive, and it is unlikely that our standardised methods of study selection and data extraction could have introduced major bias. Heterogeneity of included studies and variable presentation of outcomes by trialists (requiring substantial data imputation) precluded pooling of data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-24 09:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review published in 2012 compared pentoxifylline, cilostazol and naftidrofuryl oxalate versus placebo, or versus one another, for the treatment of intermittent claudication in individuals with peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2012</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2012</LINK> review included four studies that were also included in our review - three comparing pentoxifylline versus placebo, and one comparing pentoxifylline versus cilostazol. Study authors employed imputation techniques to include study data in meta-analyses that we ourselves did not use because of heterogeneity. Their results revealed possible increases in both PFWD and TWD for pentoxifylline groups, with percent changes of 9% (95% credible interval 2% to 22%) and 11% (95% credible interval 1% to 24%), respectively. Adverse events were not reported in the meta-analysis, but with all vasoactive drugs, mild headaches and gastrointestinal issues were reported, and no increase in cardiovascular events or deaths was described for pentoxifylline, cilostazol or naftidrofuryl oxalate. Study authors noted that heterogeneity in quality of life reporting prevented them from reporting these findings in their review. However, these data are presented as part of <LINK REF="REF-Squires-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squires 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Squires-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squires 2011</LINK>, in technology assessment reports written for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and in a recent study evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews on pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication have yielded results (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frampton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frampton 1995</LINK>) similar to the findings of this review. Greater improvement in PFWD and TWD was shown for pentoxifylline versus placebo, but review authors concluded that clinical effects remain unclear and may depend on patient characteristics, such as ABI, duration of intermittent claudication, whether risk factors were addressed and whether other treatment options had been investigated.</P>

<P>Numerous studies on pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication over more than 30 years have reported highly variable outcomes. Whilst this comprehensive review summarises and critiques all available RCT evidence, and should prove helpful to clinicians and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding pentoxifylline for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication, the role of pentoxifylline in treatment remains uncertain. However, valuable research resources might be better directed toward discovery of more effective treatments or prevention measures.</P>
