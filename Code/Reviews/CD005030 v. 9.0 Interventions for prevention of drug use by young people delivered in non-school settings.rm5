<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 14:33:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drug use is widespread among young people including those still at school.Taking drugs is not a medical problem in itself but can affect physical andmental health and social functioning. People may become dependent on drugs, and use of low risk illicit drugs can escalate into use of higher risk<BR/>drugs. In schools, programs have been introduced to prevent or reduce drug use among young people. Non-school settings for interventions include youth<BR/>clubs, primary care centres, colleges, with families and in the community. Srategies can target entire populations or be directed at specific groups,<BR/>often those at high risk.<BR/>The review authors identified 17 controlled studies, 9 cluster randomised studies with 253 clusters and 8 individually randomised studies with 1230<BR/>participants. All but two of the studies were conducted in the USA. The other studies were in the UK and China. Follow-up periods varied from at<BR/>completion of the intervention to six years. The studies were too few and each intervention too different to draw any firm conclusions on whether<BR/>non-school based interventions prevent or reduce drug use by young people.The interventions with suggested benefits need further evaluation before it<BR/>can be firmly established that they are effective. One of two studies of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on<BR/>self-reported cannabis use. Three family interventions (Focus on Families, Iowa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years)<BR/>were evaluated, in two separate studies, and may have been beneficial in preventing self-reported cannabis use. The latter two programs were<BR/>compared to the school-based Life Skills Training program. All of the eight studies of family interventions included contact with parents, in family<BR/>groups or in separate sessions for parents and their children. Multicomponent community interventions did not have any strong effects on<BR/>drug use. There were five studies, four of which added the community component to a school drug education program. Education and skills training<BR/>was not effective in two studies.<BR/>Many of the studies lacked blinding and had high numbers of participants lost to follow up. No study reported cost outcomes.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Interventions intended to prevent or reduce use of drugs by young people may be delivered in schools or in other settings. This review aims to summarise the current literature about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in non schools settings.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) - To summarise the current evidence about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in non-school settings intended to prevent or reduce drug use by young people under 25;<BR/>(2) - To investigate whether interventions' effects are modified by the type and setting of the intervention, and the age of young people targeted;<BR/>(3) - To identify areas where more research is needed.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), EMBASE (1980-2004), PsycInfo (1972-2004), SIGLE (1980-2004), CINAHL (1982-2004) and ASSIA (1987-2004). We searched also reference lists of review articles and retrieved studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials that evaluated an intervention targeting drug use by young people under 25 years of age, delivered in a non-school setting, compared with no intervention or another intervention, that reported substantive outcomes relevant to the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were tabulated, as studies were considered too dissimilar to combine using meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen studies, 9 cluster randomised studies, with 253 clusters, 8 individually randomised studies with 1230 participants, evaluating four types of intervention: motivational interviewing or brief intervention, education or skills training, family interventions and multi-component community interventions. Many studies had methodological drawbacks, especially high levels of loss to follow-up. There were too few studies for firm conclusions. One study of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on cannabis use. Three family interventions (Focus on Families, Iowa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years), each evaluated in only one study, suggested that they may be beneficial in preventing cannabis use. The studies of multi component community interventions did not find any strong effects on drug use outcomes, and the two studies of education and skills training did not find any differences between the intervention and control groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is a lack of evidence of effectiveness of the included interventions. Motivational interviewing and some family interventions may have some benefit. Cost-effectiveness has not yet been addressed in any studies, and further research is needed to determine whether any of these interventions can be recommended.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-25 14:08:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Drug use is not in itself a medical problem, but it is a risk factor for a range of adverse consequences or harms, including deleterious effects on physical and mental health and social functioning. Dependence and other problems may result from a wide range of types of drug use, and the probability of their occurrence will depend on factors associated with the drug used, the characteristics of the user, and the environment in which the use takes place (<LINK REF="REF-Zinberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinberg 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among young people, there is additional concern that some types of illicit drug use which themselves may be considered to be relatively low risk, may escalate into types of drug use which are relatively high risk (<LINK REF="REF-Kandel-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandel 1986</LINK>). For example, oral or nasal use of cocaine or other stimulants may precede a transition to injecting or smoking of these drugs. </P>
<P>Drug prevalence studies have provided data on the high level of drug use, both among those of compulsory schooling age and among young people more broadly (<LINK REF="REF-ESPAD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESPAD 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boreham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boreham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2001</LINK>). Internationally, there is a growing awareness of the need to develop effective interventions with young people in light of rising drug prevalence and to systematically review possible responses. Whilst drug prevention interventions are common (for example, drug education is mandatory in British schools), study of their effectiveness has been limited outside the United States. Studies in the USA accounted for 90% of those examined in an earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-White-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many interventions for preventing drug use among young people are carried out in primary or secondary schools, and a Cochrane review of school-based interventions is being conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2005</LINK>). However, interventions are also delivered in other settings, especially if they target young people beyond the ages of school attendance. In a related Cochrane review of the prevention of alcohol misuse (<LINK REF="REF-Foxcroft-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxcroft 2002</LINK>), 42 of the 56 studies included examined interventions delivered entirely within the school setting, with a further four studies involving school and community or family components. Non-school settings for interventions identified by <LINK REF="REF-Foxcroft-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxcroft 2002</LINK> included youth clubs, emergency rooms, colleges, young offender institutions, the family, and the community. Interventions may seek to target either non-users, in order to prevent the initiation of use of any drugs (primary prevention), existing users with a view to the minimisation of harms (secondary prevention), or both. Interventions may also be universal in orientation, targeting entire populations, or be directed at specific groups defined by prior drug use or other risk characteristics.</P>
<P>This review aims to summarise the evidence about effectiveness of interventions delivered in non-school settings that are intended to prevent drug use among young people. It will therefore include randomised controlled trials that have compared any eligible intervention with a control group. The control group may have received no intervention, another specific drug prevention intervention (for example, in a trial comparing a non school-based versus a school-based drug use prevention programme), or a standard treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) - To summarise the current evidence about the effects of interventions delivered in non-school settings intended to prevent or reduce drug use by young people under 25, compared with no intervention or a different intervention, on drug use and other substantive outcome measures;<BR/>(2) - To investigate whether interventions' effects are modified by the type and setting of the intervention, and the age of young people targeted;<BR/>(3) - To identify areas where more research is needed.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Eligible study designs were randomised controlled trials </P>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion if:<BR/>(1) - the intervention(s) evaluated was intended to prevent or reduce drug use<BR/>(2) - the target population was people under the age of 25, and outcomes were reported for this group<BR/>(3) - the intervention was delivered in a non-school setting (i.e. not in a primary or secondary school as part of the curriculum). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Young people less than 25 years of age, either illicit drug users or non-users. Studies that included older participants were included if the number of older participants was small and the intervention was targeted at young people, or if data were published or could be provided for young participants separately. We did not include studies that do not report the age of participants, or where the intervention is not clearly targeted at young people and are likely to have included a substantial proportion of older people.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any non school-based intervention designed for prevention of drug use, targeted at young people, compared with another intervention or no intervention. We included studies that used schools as the site of recruitment but the intervention was not delivered in a school. Studies in which the experimental and control groups received the same school-based intervention, and the experimental group received an additional non-school based intervention were included, as they tested the effects of adding a non-school based component to a school-based programme. Studies evaluating a school-based programme plus a non-school based prevention intervention versus no treatment were excluded, as it was not possible to separate the effects of the school-based and non school-based interventions. However, studies evaluating interventions that included some school based elements in a predominantly non school-based intervention were included. A consensus decision was reached about inclusion of such studies. For example, a study of a classroom curriculum based intervention such as Life Skills Training (LST) plus a community intervention would be excluded, but a community intervention that involved teachers in one of a number of activities would be eligible.</P>
<P>Studies that evaluated treatment interventions i.e. those offered within formal services in response to either voluntary or coerced help-seeking for problems associated with illicit drug use, were excluded. Interventions that targeted either licit and illicit drug use, or illicit drug use along with other behaviours were included. Studies of the prevention of the use of solvents and other substances whose legal status may be variable were included, providing the substances themselves are generally understood to be 'drugs'. Both primary prevention and secondary prevention interventions were included, as were interventions specifically targeting drug users or other groups of young people. The prevention of steroid use or other forms of drug use not designed to be mood altering (such as performance enhancing drugs in sport), and for which drug dependence is understood not to be possible, were excluded.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses classifying studies by their type of intervention and setting were planned but not performed due to lack of data (see "Methods of review" below).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) - Drug use or initiation of drug use (for primary prevention studies) or reduction or cessation of drug use (for secondary prevention studies)<BR/>measured as(a) - self reported and (b) - biologically validated or otherwise corroborated<BR/>(2) - substance dependence ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM IV)criteria)<BR/>(3) - death (all cause and drug related)<BR/>(4) - hospitalisation<BR/>(5) - treatment for drug-related health problems<BR/>(6) - criminal activity</P>
<P>Other relevant outcomes (for example, scales measuring substance use) were reported by some studies and are reported in the review, identified as non-pre-specified outcomes.</P>
<P>Studies that reported eligible interventions but did not mention that any relevant outcomes were recorded were excluded. Where relevant outcomes were apparently recorded but not reported, authors were contacted for clarification.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-03-25 14:06:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We located relevant studies through a multiple search strategy including electronic searching and hand searching.</P>
<P>As eligible studies may be described in a variety of ways, we found it very difficult to produce a list of search terms that will identify all eligible studies. This is especially true for terms describing the intervention and the outcomes. Many different words could be used to describe prevention or reduction of drug use, and attempting to specify all of these would risk missing eligible studies.</P>
<P>We located relevant studies by electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials which includes the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trials Register (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (OVID 1966 - July 2004), EMBASE (OVID 1980 - July 2004) and PsycInfo (July 2004), CINAHL (1982 - July 2004), ASSIA (CSA Illumina 1987 - July 2004), and SIGLE (WEBSPIRS 1980 - July 2004).

</P>
<P>We checked the reference lists of all potentially eligible studies obtained as full reports to identify any further studies not retrieved by the electronic search. Full reports of review articles retrieved by the search were obtained and checked for other relevant citations.</P>
<P>All searches included non-English language literature and studies with English abstracts were assessed for inclusion using the same criteria. No potentially eligible studies in languages other than English were identified.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>One author (SG) screened the titles of all papers identified by the electronic searches to reject studies that clearly did not meet the review's inclusion criteria. Abstracts of the remaining studies were then checked by two authors, and those that were potentially eligible were obtained as full reports. Two authors then independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from eligible studies, including the study design and methodological information to allow assessment of protection against bias, subgroup information and the pre-specified outcomes. Authors of all included studies were contacted for clarification of the study methodology or outcome information where this was unclear or missing. Quality assessment was not used for any sensitivity or subgroup analyses, because no meta-analyses were performed.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of the methodological quality<BR/>
</B>The quality assessment included the following aspects of studies:<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Randomisation and allocation concealment<BR/>
</B>The method of generating a random allocation sequence and the mechanism for allocating participants to groups were recorded. Allocation concealment was graded as adequate, unclear or inadequate.<BR/>Adequate allocation concealment: central randomizations (e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics), opaque sealed envelopes, on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered or another description that guaranteed concealment.<BR/>Unclear allocation concealment: when the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach or reported an approach that did not fall in the category A or C.<BR/>Inadequate allocation concealment: alternation or reference to case numbers, dates of birth, day of the week. Any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation or could be changed after allocation, such as an open list of random numbers or other description that contained elements not guaranteeing concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding<BR/>
</B>Blinding of participants or practitioners was considered unlikely given the nature of the interventions. Blinding of outcome assessment was graded yes, no or unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Completeness of follow-up<BR/>
</B>This was evaluated by recording the number and percentage of randomised participants lost in each group.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Analysis in randomised groups (yes/no)<BR/>
</B>If participants had not all been analysed in their randomised groups, they were restored to the correct group for the review if sufficient information to allow this was included in the study report or could be obtained from the authors. <B> </B>
</P>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports on the review's specified outcomes. In many cases, results were presented as statistics resulting from complex analyses rather than as numbers of participants with the outcome. In these cases, we extracted the results of the published analysis, and, where possible, the numbers of participants with each outcome at each data collection point. Where these data could not be extracted, authors were contacted to ask whether they could be provided. </P>
<P>The results from each study, either a published analysis or a risk ratio and 95% confidence interval calculated from data in the report or supplied by the author, were tabulated (Tables 1, 2 and 3). No meta-analyses were performed because the studies' interventions were too different to allow meaningful combination.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>For inclusion of cluster randomised trials in meta-analyses, we planned to adjust the sample sizes of the intervention and control groups to take account of non-independence between individuals in the same cluster. Where published estimates of the intra cluster correlation coefficient were not available, authors were contacted to ask whether an estimate of the ICC was available from the study. For some cluster randomised trials, we calculated risk ratios and confidence intervals using data extracted from publications or provided by authors. In these cases, we adjusted the analysis to take account of clustering using a value of 0.02 for the ICC. This value was chosen because most reported ICCs from three studies were less than this (see Methodological Quality). We used the ICC to adjust the analysis using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>. These adjusted analyses were calculated for cases where the unadjusted analysis suggested that there may be a difference between the groups. For most analyses, the number of events was too small to show any difference in an unadjusted analysis; adjusting the analysis will always increase the width of the confidence intervals, and therefore in these cases the adjusted analysis would not reach a different conclusion. Adjustment by dividing by the design effect involves some approximation, as the adjusted number of events and denominator must be rounded to the nearest whole number; when the number of events is small this means that the adjusted analysis may be a poor approximation. For these reasons, adjusted analyses were performed only for analyses where there 10 or more events in one of the groups, or the unadjusted analysis suggested a difference. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses are indicated in the tales of results.</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were pre-specified but not performed due to lack of data:<BR/>(1). Age of participants: 12 years and under; 13 to -15, 16 to -19, 20 years and over, mixed or not specified; <BR/>(2). Type of intervention (e.g. psychosocial or educational) <BR/>(3). Setting of intervention.</P>

</UL>
<P>Eight studies (3 cluster randomised studies with 104 clusters, and 5 individually randomised studies with 845 participants) evaluated an intervention designed to improve family functioning or parenting skills, delivered to parents, children or families, either alone or in groups. One study evaluated the addition of a family-based intervention to the school-based Life Skills Training programme (<LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2002</LINK>), and one compared a programme delivered to parents and children with a child-only programme (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>). Six studies compared a non-school based programme of education or skills training to a control group. The comparison groups for these studies varied, and included delayed intervention (<LINK REF="STD-McGillicuddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McGillicuddy 2001</LINK>), self study (<LINK REF="STD-Wolchik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wolchik 2002</LINK>), minimal contact (<LINK REF="STD-Dembo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dembo 2000</LINK>) or no intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Lochman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lochman 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The content, duration, target group and mode of delivery of the training interventions varied.

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dembo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dembo 2000</LINK>) did not state the duration of the intervention or the number of sessions. The majority of programmes were delivered to groups of parents, young people, or families in locations other than their home; only two trials included interventions to individual families in their home (<LINK REF="STD-Dembo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dembo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>).

<B>Randomisation and allocation concealment</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>All studies were stated to have been randomised. Only one of the individually randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wolchik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wolchik 2002</LINK>) provided information on the generation of the random sequence (by computer random number generation), and none provided enough information on allocation concealment to judge whether it was effective.</P>
<P>Two cluster randomised studies gave information on the method of randomisation of clusters (<LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>). In one (<LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2004</LINK>) the method was adequately concealed (performed by a researcher not involved in the study), but in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>) concealment of allocations was unclear. Randomisation was in this case by tossing a coin, which is random but could be open to subversion.</P>
<P>A potential problem in randomisation was noted in one study (<LINK REF="STD-McGillicuddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McGillicuddy 2001</LINK>). This was initially assumed to be individually randomised, but information supplied by the author suggested that in fact groups of participants were randomised. This may have introduced bias into the comparison of the groups.</P>
<P>The text of one cluster randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>), which randomised villages to a multi-component community intervention or control, suggested that the intervention and control villages may have been in geographically separated areas. If so, this may have been a source of bias, as there are likely to have been differences between the control and intervention groups. For example, the report states that the ethnic mix of the intervention villages and control villages was different; the intervention villages contained about twice as many people belonging to the Jingpo ethnic minority (55% versus 25%) and half the proportion belonging to the Dai minority (28% versus 57%). The author was contacted for clarification but no reply was received.</P>

<B>Blinding</B>

</UL>
<P>The nature of the interventions evaluated in these trials makes blinding of participants virtually impossible. In many cases interventions were delivered by the researchers, who were therefore not blind to study group. No studies mentioned any attempts at blinding of practitioners, and only one had partially blinded outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2004</LINK>). In this study, an investigator blind to study group performed outcome interviews on a sample of participants.</P>

<B>Losses to follow-up</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Losses to follow-up were generally high. Five studies did not report outcome information for more than 20% of the participants at the longest follow-up. Follow-up of a high proportion of participants several years after recruitment is difficult, although one study achieved a rate of 91% at six years (<LINK REF="STD-Wolchik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wolchik 1993</LINK>). However, some studies reported high rates of loss to follow-up even short times after randomisation. No major differences were noted in follow-up rates between the arms of any trial.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Statistical analyses</I>
</B>
<BR/>Most studies used methods such as analysis of covariance for their statistical analysis, modelling the outcome variables as a function of baseline characteristics, time and group allocation. Results were almost always presented as statistics and p-values, or a statement about statistical significance, rather than a measure of the difference between the groups and a confidence interval.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>) reported outcomes for boys and girls separately, based on a finding of a statistically significant difference between the sexes. It was unclear whether these were planned or unplanned subgroup analyses. We have combined data for boys and girls in this review.</P>
<P>Nine cluster-randomised trials were included in the review. Five were analysed in the primary publication using a method that took account of non-independence between members of each cluster, but none reported values for the intra cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) in the primary publication. After contacting authors, three studies provided estimates of ICCs; in one, they varied, depending on the outcome, from 0 to 0.02, in one they were all less than 0.01, and in the third they ranged from 0 to 0.12.</P>

<I>(2) Family interventions</I>
</B> See Table 02<BR/>The published results generally showed no clear differences between the groups. Three interventions (evaluated in two RCTs) appeared to be superior to no intervention in preventing self-reported cannabis use; Focus on Families (p&lt;0.10) (<LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1997</LINK>), Iowa Strengthening Families Program (ISFP) (p&lt;0.01), and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years (PDFY) (p&lt;0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Spoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 1999</LINK>). Calculated results for this study, using the numbers of drug users at follow-up, showed an advantageous effect of the ISFP on self-reported lifetime cannabis use at 6 year follow-up (adjusted RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95) and self-reported cannabis use in the past year at six year follow-up (adjusted RR 0.44 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96), but no clear effect of PDFY on any of the outcomes and any follow-up period. However, less than 70% of the participants were followed up at 4 and 6 years, so there may be a possibility of bias in these results.</P>

<I>
<BR/>
</I>The primary care-based study (<LINK REF="STD-Oliansky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oliansky 1997</LINK>) used scores on the Substance Use Screening Instrument (SUSI) to measure drug use. The control group scores were higher than those of the intervention group at both 1 month and 3 month follow-up (1 month means, intervention 1.15, control 4.31, p=0.05; 3 month means intervention 1.58, control 7.46, p=0.04; no standard deviations given).</P>
<P>The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-McCambridge-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCambridge 2004</LINK>) included baseline covariate in its analysis to control for imbalances between the groups. There was a large decrease in the frequency of self-reported cannabis use in the intervention group (15.7 times per week to 5.4) but not in the control group (13.3 to 16.9); this remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounders. There were also reductions in the quantity of cannabis used and the number of days it was smoked in the intervention compared to the control group. There was no difference in the use of stimulant drugs, but the intervention group were less likely to report use of non-stimulant illicit drugs other than cannabis (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.82 p=0.04).</P>
<P>(4) Multi component community intervention See Table 03<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK> found a large reduction in new drug users in intervention villages compared to control villages (published result). However, the methodology of this study may be suspect, and the calculated result from the data extracted from the publication does not appear to support this conclusion.</P>
<P>Two studies that evaluated addition of a community component to a school-based programme (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 2004</LINK>) published results for boys and girls separately. No differences in substance use were identified. However, the calculated result from Flay 2004, combining data for boys and girls, suggested that the school plus community intervention may possibly reduce self-reported substance use. This result was marginally statistically significant when analysed without adjustment for clustering, but not so when adjusted using a value of the ICC of 0.02 (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05). This adjustment may be conservative. The third similar study, <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>, found a marginally statistically significant reduction in self-reported cannabis use in the group randomised to the community programme in addition to the school-based programme (p=0.043), but the difference in the number of users at four years was small (6.7% versus 8.5%).</P>
<P>The community study of native American youth, <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>, found no clear effects of the community intervention on self-reported cannabis use.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is a lack of evidence showing that non-school based interventions are effective in preventing or reducing drug use by young people. This is mainly because existing evidence is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. A large number of potentially eligible trials were excluded from this review because they did not collect data on substantive measures of drug use. We did not include studies that recorded only participants' attitudes to drugs and their behavioural intentions, rather than their actual use of drugs. The relationship of these surrogate outcome measures to drug use and drug-related health problems is unknown, but it cannot safely be assumed that there is a strong relationship.</P>
<P>We did not perform any meta-analyses in this review, as we judged that the interventions were too heterogeneous to be combined meaningfully. The included trials evaluated a wide variety of interventions, and so far there has been no replication of trials by different research groups. There needs to be independent evaluation of the interventions that suggest benefit, before it can be established firmly whether or not they are effective.</P>
<P>Many of the RCTs in this review were affected by methodological problems. Some of these may have been simply poor reporting: for example, few studies gave any information about concealment of allocations before randomisation, but it is likely that this was adequate in some studies but not mentioned in the published report. Losses to follow-up were high in many studies, with a consequent risk of bias. Some of the populations studied may be difficult to follow-up, and it may be that trials in these populations will always tend to have a high rate of exclusions. Many of the included studies used cluster randomised designs, which are appropriate for many of the interventions evaluated. For example, for multi-component community interventions cluster randomisation is probably the only design possible. However, some studies did not account for clustering in the analysis, but instead analysed as if the trial had been individually randomised. This will overestimate the precision of any difference between the groups, and make it more likely that spurious differences will be found. Typically, these studies included relatively few clusters with a large number of participants per cluster. In these circumstances an analysis as if individually randomised could be very misleading, as the precision of the effect estimate may be substantially overestimated.</P>
<P>Most of the RCTs evaluating family or educational interventions did not demonstrate clear effects on drug use or other substantive outcome measures. The quantity of evidence for each intervention is therefore limited. The <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 1999</LINK> study demonstrated a reduction in self-reported cannabis use in the groups assigned to the PDFY and ISFP, and hence suggests that these interventions may be helpful in preventing drug use. However, there was high loss to follow-up in this study, and the sample size available was not large. Further evaluation of these interventions in larger studies and different contexts would provide stronger evidence about their effectiveness.</P>
<P>There is little information from this review about the effectiveness of multi-component community interventions, as only five such studies were included. Several studies of community interventions were excluded from the review for various reasons. In four of the included studies the community component was an "add-on" to a school-based programme, and the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>) had significant methodological problems. Two of the studies suggested that the community intervention may have an effect on self-reported substance use or cannabis use (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 2004</LINK>), but these results were of marginal statistical significance. The interventions evaluated in the five included trials were all different, and it is not possible to draw any general conclusions about the effectiveness of this type of intervention.</P>
<P>None of the included studies included an economic evaluation or any cost outcomes. Use of non-school educational, family training or multi-component community interventions is likely to involve significant costs, so it would be beneficial for studies to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Decisions about whether to use any of them on a large scale will be based largely on economic considerations, and so high-quality economic evidence would help to provide a sound basis for service provision decisions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>None of these interventions has been shown unequivocally to be effective, and cost-effectiveness is unknown. It is therefore difficult to recommend their use until more research has been conducted.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to establish whether any of the interventions considered in this review is effective in preventing or reducing drug use by young people. Further trials are therefore justified. Some interventions appear to have potential benefit, and these should be prioritised for future trials. Future RCTs should measure substantive drug use, economic and health outcomes, use a sufficiently large sample size to show clinically important differences in these outcomes, and be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org). If a cluster randomised design is used, trials should be designed and analysed taking clustering into account.</P>
