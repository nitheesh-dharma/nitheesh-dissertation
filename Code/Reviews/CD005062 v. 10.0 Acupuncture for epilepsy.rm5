<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-01 12:35:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with epilepsy are currently treated with antiepileptic drugs but a significant number of people continue to have seizures and many experience adverse effects to the drugs. As a result, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies and acupuncture is one of those. Seventeen randomised controlled trials with 1538 participants were included in the current systematic review (literature search conducted on 3rd June 2013). </P>
<P>Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control (at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency). If we assumed that 500 out of 1000 patients treated with Chinese herbs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that 485 to 655 out of 1000 patients treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures or satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 97 to 177 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 289 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 700 out of 1000 patients treated with phenytoin alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 322 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 126 to 445 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 583 to 923 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom, but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 127 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 118 to 309 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve seizure freedom; If we assumed that 444 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 475 to 840 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may have been better in achieving seizure freedom but not satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 82 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 132 to 406 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 721 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 677 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. </P>
<P>Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. However, the included trials were small, heterogeneous and had a high risk of bias. It remains uncertain whether acupuncture is effective and safe for treating people with epilepsy.</P>

<P>We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow-up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE-31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:12:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 50 per 100,000 and a prevalence of 5 to 10 per 1000 in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>). About 2% to 3% of the general population will be given a diagnosis of epilepsy at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>), the majority of whom will go into remission. About 70% of patients with epilepsy become seizure free but up to 30% continue to have seizures despite treatment with adequate doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), that is they become drug resistant. Hence there is a constant search for newer modes of treatment. Furthermore, the commonly used AEDs can have adverse effects such as causing gingival hyperplasia; gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting); osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and bone marrow toxicity; hepatotoxicity; nephrotoxicity; neurological symptoms (ataxia, dizziness, diplopia, somnolence); cognitive, mood and behavioural disturbances; endocrine dysfunction; and teratogenicity; as well as allergic reactions including skin rashes, toxic epidermal necrolysis or Steven Johnson syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2001</LINK>). Other treatments for epilepsy such as a ketogenic diet, use of a vagal nerve stimulator, and epilepsy surgery have their own limitations and complications. As a result, many people are turning to alternative complementary therapy for treatment of their condition and acupuncture is one of the popular options.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:12:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acupuncture is a procedure in which specific body areas, the meridian points, are pierced with fine needles for therapeutic purposes. It is one of the major modalities of treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. In China its use can be traced back more than 2000 years (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1996</LINK>). Apart from the traditional needle acupuncture various forms of acupuncture have been developed, including electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, acupressure, and catgut implantation at acupoints. Being a relatively simple, inexpensive and safe treatment, acupuncture has been well accepted by inhabitants in China and people worldwide who are of Chinese origin. Acupuncture is widely used by many Chinese practitioners in various neurological disorders as an alternative treatment approach (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1993</LINK>). It is also increasingly practiced in some Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:12:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acupuncture involves complex theories of regulation of the five elements (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood), yin and yang, Qi, and blood and body fluids. By stimulating various meridian points disharmony and dysregulation of organ systems is corrected to relieve symptoms and restore natural internal homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Maciocia-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciocia 1989</LINK>). Many studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). These responses can occur both locally or close to the site of application (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 1989</LINK>) and at a distance, mediated mainly by the sensory neurons to many structures that are within the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Magnusson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magnusson 1994</LINK>). The result is activation of pathways affecting various physiological systems in the brain as well as in the periphery (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middlekauff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middlekauff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are both anecdotal reports and animal studies that suggest acupuncture may inhibit seizures. In an experiment of penicillin-induced epilepsy in rats electroacupuncture was found to inhibit seizures, possibly through decreasing neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription in the hippocampus (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2000</LINK>). Antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors was found to attenuate the antiepileptic effect of electroacupuncture, whilst electroacupuncture acted synergistically with the antagonists of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1997</LINK>). Electroacupuncture may theoretically have an effect on epilepsy by increasing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1992</LINK>) such as serotonin, GABA, or opioid peptides. Beneficial effects on human epilepsy have been reported in uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials compared needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs with Chinese herbs alone (<LINK REF="STD-Ma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xiong 2003</LINK>). Although the Chinese herbs used were different in the two studies, they were the same in the treatment and control groups in each study. Therefore, unless significant interaction between the effects of acupuncture and the particular type of Chinese herbs was present, it was expected that the comparison of outcomes between the treatment and control groups represented the net effect of acupuncture. Where the described outcomes were comparable, we combined the results in a meta-analysis. We found that apart from using different acupoints and different control herbs, there was no significant clinical heterogeneity between the two trials. Both trials included only paediatric patients with generalized epilepsy of widely differing durations. There was also no significant statistical heterogeneity in the various outcomes reported and hence the results were combined in meta-analyses using the fixed-effect model.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:14:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the current review, we included a total of 17 randomised controlled trials with 1538 participants suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The participants in the different trials had a wide age range. The included trials were small, heterogeneous, and had a high risk of bias and short follow-up.</P>
<P>Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (two trials). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (two trials) or at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency (two trials) but may have achieved a better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (one trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (two trials). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (two trials) but may have been effective in achieving at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency (two trials) and better QOL after treatment (one trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (four trials) but may have been effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (five trials) and better QOL after treatment (one trial). Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may be effective in achieving seizure freedom (four trials) and better QOL after treatment (one trial), but not at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency (four trials). Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to the control treatment in the included trials.</P>
<P>Although needle acupuncture and catgut implantation at acupoints appeared better than control treatment in some outcome measures they were not effective in many other outcome measures. Moreover, some outcome measures were reported by single trials only and no meta-analysis was possible. On the other hand, the single trial with a sham control (<LINK REF="STD-Kloster-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kloster 1999</LINK>) concluded that acupuncture was not effective in reducing seizure frequency, increasing the number of seizure-free weeks or improving QOL in any aspect. However, its small sample size might have limited the statistical power to detect a small difference. Since this trial focused on adults only, whether acupuncture has different effects on different age groups warrants further investigation.</P>
<P>Based on the current systematic review, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of acupuncture on epilepsy. Although we identified 17 randomised controlled trials, they were heterogeneous with respect to the treatment and comparison groups used, and the number of patients recruited in each trial was small. The included trials were also heterogeneous with respect to the age of the patients, underlying epilepsy types, acupuncture and control regimens, and outcomes chosen, which limits the reliability of the pooled results.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:14:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence on acupuncture for treatment of epilepsy is far from complete. The included trials were all quite small, recruiting only 34 to 170 patients in each trial (18 to 85 patients in the treatment groups and 16 to 85 patients in the control groups), thus limiting the statistical power and precision of the effect estimates. In addition, no trial reported a sample size calculation, which is essential for ensuring adequate sample size and statistical power. Because of the many different comparisons, which further limited the number of patients in each comparison, the generalizability of the findings is questionable. The follow-up period used in the trials was also quite short, just one year at most. Whether acupuncture is effective in the long term certainly needs further investigation.</P>
<P>Some of the included trials compared acupuncture with AEDs only, without a concurrent placebo or sham control group. We cannot tell whether acupuncture is effective per se in these trials. The drugs used in the control group might not be appropriate for all patients, as the patients might have been resistant to those treatments already. The dosage of the AED used in the control group might also be inadequate. Sometimes the AED used might aggravate seizures in some patients, resulting in an apparent effectiveness of acupuncture when in fact it was not effective. Furthermore, we cannot reliably determine which AED acupuncture might be superior to as the control treatment was not standardised in some trials. Similarly, which acupuncture regimen is effective and in which patients cannot be reliably determined as the treatment regimen was individualised in some of the trials. As the current review only included trials on needle acupuncture (with manual or electrical stimulation) and catgut implantation at acupoints, whether other forms of acupuncture such as laser acupuncture or acupressure are effective for treating epilepsy is uncertain.</P>
<P>Although no excessive adverse effects were found in the trials that were included, we cannot assure the safety of acupuncture in epilepsy patients since the small sample sizes might have limited the power of detecting rare adverse effects. Although the existing literature on acupuncture in epilepsy patients and patients with a variety of other conditions has supported that it is a relatively safe treatment modality, which can obviate the side effects of AEDs, acupuncture is not without risks. Infections and inappropriate needle placement causing inadvertent damage do occur occasionally. Acupuncture should, therefore, be performed by a well-trained therapist who is experienced, understands the theories behind it, and takes the necessary precautions.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:14:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials all carried a high risk of bias, as evidenced by the lack of descriptions of the randomisation methods, concealment of randomisation, or attempts at blinding in most trials. The reliability of randomisation was questionable in most trials since the treatment and the control groups might not have been comparable at baseline. The treatment and control groups had at least one potentially important baseline difference in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kloster-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kloster 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2000</LINK>) and important baseline characteristics were not mentioned in most of the other trials. Furthermore, most trials did not include a placebo or sham control group and therefore a placebo effect could not be excluded, and these trials might bias the results in favour of acupuncture. On the other hand, the acupuncture methods used were not standardised within the intervention or the control groups in some trials, nor were different methods stratified within a treatment group, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of a particular acupuncture protocol.</P>

<P>We searched extensively in the international and Chinese literature. Some studies that were not published in English or Chinese and not reached by our search strategies might have been missed. Publication bias was also possible although the small number of trials precluded further investigation of this by constructing a funnel plot.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:14:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although numerous observational human studies and experimental animal studies have suggested potential benefits of acupuncture for treating epilepsy, there is a paucity of high quality clinical evidence. The current evidence does not support the use of acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:14:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are not many randomised controlled trials assessing acupuncture for epilepsy, especially using control groups that allow estimation of the net effect of acupuncture. The existing trials are of small size with a high risk of bias. Further high quality studies with larger sample sizes and with appropriate standardised treatment and control groups are needed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating epilepsy. The randomisation method used should be rigorous and concealed. Although blinding of the therapist applying acupuncture is difficult, blinding of the patients, the other care providers, and outcome assessors should be attempted in order to minimise performance and detection biases. Since epilepsy is a highly heterogeneous disease with different aetiologies and severities, acupuncture is likely to have different effects, if any, on different subgroups of patients. Future clinical trials should, therefore, be focused on a particular subgroup or include a very large sample size to delineate the effect of acupuncture on different types of patients. The effectiveness of different forms of acupuncture at different acupoints using different regimens should also be systematically investigated, in a standardised way. Since epilepsy in children and adults have many important differences, both paediatric and adult clinical trials are needed before the results can be safely generalized to all age groups. Since epilepsy is a chronic disease which is well known to wax and wane, with or without treatment, a longer follow-up period with serial measurements of outcomes is also highly recommended to determine the genuine effectiveness of acupuncture and its long-term effects.</P>

<P>The assessment of risk of bias was updated to adhere to the recommendation by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). As a result, the Jadad score was abandoned. The plan for the sensitivity analysis was also changed accordingly to exclude studies which carried a high risk of bias. We updated the analysis to use 99% confidence intervals (instead of 95% confidence intervals) for frequency of adverse effects if there were several adverse effects reported in order to account for multiple statistical testing.</P>

<TITLE>Query regarding excluded studies</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The following query was made on 27 June 2006.<BR/>Why were trials which compared acupuncture alone with other treatments (pragmatic studies) excluded from the review? How many such trials were there? I think these are a valid form of evaluation and would like to know what data, if any, these studies yielded.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2014-04-01 14:20:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review is to evaluate whether acupuncture is effective for treatment of epilepsy. Therefore only studies that yielded the net treatment effect of acupuncture were included. Net treatment effect of acupuncture can be determined by comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments.</P>
<P>Studies comparing acupuncture with another treatment alone cannot help us to determine whether acupuncture itself is effective or not, because even though these studies show that acupuncture is more effective than another treatment for example antiepileptic drug or herbs, it does not necessarily mean that acupuncture per se is effective as the drug may have a negative impact on the outcomes such that even no treatment or an ineffective treatment is better than the comparator drug. Therefore these studies comparing acupuncture with another treatment alone were excluded.</P>
<P>Studies comparing acupuncture with another treatment alone that we identified through a systematic search of the literature are included in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. The detailed findings of these studies are not shown but interested readers may refer to the references listed.</P>
<P>
<B>NB: <U>17 July 2008</U>. Please note that this review has now been updated (Issue 4, 2008) to include the excluded studies i.e. studies comparing acupuncture with antiepileptic drugs.</B>
