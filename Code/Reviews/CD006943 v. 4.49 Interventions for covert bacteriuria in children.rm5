<P>Covert bacteriuria occurs when bacteria are found in urine either during routine screening or incidentally during other investigations. Unlike urinary tract infections, children with covert bacteriuria do not appear to have symptoms at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about whether antibiotic treatment can help to clear infection, reduce recurrence, or prevent kidney damage. Any harmful effects of providing treatment also need to be identified and understood.</P>
<P>We identified three studies reporting the results on 460 girls. There was insufficient evidence about the harms and benefits of treatments to draw reliable conclusions, but it appears that antibiotic treatment is not likely to benefit children in the long term.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-29 11:49:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>This review included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved 460 children (all girls). Overall, the studies were not methodologically strong. Gaps in reporting among the included studies made assessment of methodological quality challenging. One study reported that the number of children with bacteriuria was significantly reduced at follow-up six months after antibiotic treatment (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83). At follow-up two years after treatment, two studies reported that there was no evidence of a reduction in persistent bacteriuria (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.03 to 3.44). At follow-up four to five years after initial treatment, all included studies reported that antibiotic treatment was effective in reducing the number of children with bacteriuria (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70). There were no differences in kidney growth between treated and untreated groups (MD 0.62; 95% CI -0.43 to 1.68).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-12 08:09:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-29 12:01:36 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequently encountered bacterial infections in infants and children, and the most common bacterial infection in infants under three months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2005</LINK>). Accurately classifying the infection is often challenging in clinical practice. Infection of the urinary tract broadly presents as covert bacteriuria on screening, or with non-systemic symptoms and infection limited to the urethra and bladder (cystitis), or with systemic symptoms and infection of the kidneys (pyelonephritis). It is more common for boys under the age of 12 months to present with UTIs, but this pattern reverses in the childhood years when significantly more girls develop UTIs.</P>
<P>Conflicting results emerged from several screening studies of schoolgirls that investigated covert bacteriuria in the 1960s and 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Brundtland-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brundtland 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COBSG-1978" TYPE="STUDY">COBSG 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunin-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunin 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindberg 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meadow-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meadow 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savage-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1973</LINK>). At that time it, was estimated that 5% to 10% of girls developed covert bacteriuria during childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK>). This prompted some clinicians to advocate screening programs to detect bacteriuria and treat children with few or no symptoms. Children who screened positive for bacteriuria were often treated with antibiotics on the presumption that this would improve outcomes in the longer term. In some countries, screening for bacteriuria remains common practice, and to our knowledge, no review of studies investigating treatment effectiveness exists. Some clinicians now believe that many of these past studies do not provide adequate evidence of treatment efficacy to recommend antibiotics or other treatment options. Others are of the opinion that uncertainty around individual studies is sufficient reason to screen for and treat bacteriuria in infants, children and adolescents. As recently as the 1990s, uncertainty remained about whether to treat bacteriuria detected in mass screening studies of over 40,000 Malaysian children (<LINK REF="REF-Zainal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zainal 1994</LINK>) and 28,000 Japanese children (<LINK REF="REF-Iitaka-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iitaka 1990</LINK>). General practitioners and other primary and community health workers often detect covert bacteriuria incidentally in infants, children and adolescents. Clear evidence is needed to inform treatment decisions.</P>
<P>It is important to establish if antibiotics are effective in improving patient outcomes by eliminating infection, reducing recurrence and preventing long term kidney damage. Currently, antibiotics are prescribed for covert bacteriuria in some settings, but treatment also carries risks. Individual patients may develop resistance to antibiotics, and there are implications for the population in development of bacterial resistance. There are also significant costs associated with staff and patient time, and testing. Although treatment may be feasible, it is essential that benefit to individual children outweigh any harm.</P>
<P>The terms 'asymptomatic bacteriuria' and 'covert bacteriuria' are often used interchangeably, but 'asymptomatic bacteriuria' suggests that the child has never experienced symptoms, which is not always the case. In some previous studies, children identified with bacteriuria and no apparent accompanying symptoms later described mild urinary symptoms at the time of testing. We chose to use 'covert bacteriuria' indicating that bacteriuria remained undetected until testing was undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Newcastle-Group-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcastle Group 1975</LINK>). Covert bacteriuria can be defined as significant bacteriuria (at least 10<SUP>5</SUP> cfu/mL) (<LINK REF="REF-Savage-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1973</LINK>).</P>

<P>Subgroup analysis was planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, such as participants, interventions and study quality. Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, renal pathology, the type of agent used, prior agents used, duration of therapy, inclusion of children subsequently found to have reflux or renal parenchymal defects, method of urine collection, and endpoint reported such as symptomatic or covert infection. Another possible source of heterogeneity was the timing of endpoints reported. Because each included study defined success or failure at different time points, subgroup analysis would enable investigation of any differences in results between different time points for defining success or failure of the intervention. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed using descriptive techniques because they were likely to be different for the various agents used. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was to be calculated for each adverse effect and compared with either no treatment or another agent.</P>

<P>We included three studies that enrolled 522 participants, all of whom were girls aged 4 to 18 years. Data from 449 of the 522 participants were analysed. A detailed description of the studies is presented in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. All included studies were conducted in the UK. The Cardiff-Oxford Bacteriuria Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-COBSG-1978" TYPE="STUDY">COBSG 1978</LINK>) compared 7 to 14 day antibiotic regimens with no treatment; the Newcastle Covert Bacteriuria Research Group (<LINK REF="STD-NCBRG-1981" TYPE="STUDY">NCBRG 1981</LINK>) compared two year antibiotic regimens with no treatment; and <LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK> compared three month antibiotic regimens with a control group. No details were reported for the control group in the <LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK> study, so they were assumed to have not received treatment. All studies were in populations of school-aged girls who were recruited during screening programs that were conducted in schools during the late 1960s and early 1970s. These programs appear to have screened only girls; none of the studies mention boys. Duration of antibiotic treatment for all three studies was different; however, each study prescribed antibiotics to treatment groups based on the sensitivity of the organism cultured. Antibiotics included co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole), ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid and pivmecillinam. In control groups, no treatment was given, but all studies administered antibiotics to girls in control groups who developed either symptomatic UTI or another infection that required antibiotics.</P>
<P>Persistent bacteriuria was defined as 10<SUP>5 </SUP>cfu/mL at follow-up in all studies. Two studies required at least two positive urine samples, and one study required three. Apart from the microbial definition of bacteriuria, there was no consistent application of standard definitions for the measured outcomes in the included studies. Studies measured persistent bacteriuria at different times - from six months to five years - following treatment. Symptomatic UTI was reported as pyelonephritis in two studies and cystitis in two studies, but standard definitions of these conditions were not provided. In some cases we used symptoms suggestive of either cystitis or pyelonephritis to inform outcome categories. Kidney growth was measured in two studies.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK>) reported significantly reduced incidence of bacteriuria six months following treatment in participants who received antibiotics (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (1 study, 42 participants): RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83).

<P>All three included studies reported on persistence of bacteriuria at four to five years and showed that antibiotic treatment was effective in reducing the incidence of bacteriuria (3 studies, 444 participants): RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89). Although there was borderline statistical heterogeneity among studies (I = 67%), likely to be explained by differences in duration of the antibiotic regimen, the direction of the effect was consistent.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-29 12:06:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>There were insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for covert bacteriuria in children. It appears that by the age of four to five years, antibiotics contribute to a significant reduction in the incidence of bacteriuria, but there is no evidence that antibiotics reduce the number of symptomatic UTIs. This review identified conflicts in findings for persistent bacteriuria. One study showed reduced bacteriuria at six months, two studies showed no difference at two years, and three studies show a significant reduction in bacteriuria at four to five years. This is likely explained by the small number of included studies and the moderate to high heterogeneity among studies. Data regarding kidney growth is unclear, and although it appears that covert bacteriuria does not affect kidney growth, only two studies contributed to this outcome. The lack of precision around these results means that we were unable to draw conclusions with confidence.</P>
<P>We identified important methodological considerations that limit the strength of making conclusions.</P>
<P>One limiting aspect of this review is the lack of reporting of persistent bacteriuria, both in terms of defining bacteriuria and reporting if the persistent bacteriuria was symptomatic or asymptomatic. All three studies reported a reduction in bacteriuria at four to five years, but without a clear indication if symptoms contributed to this outcome, the clinical significance is not clear.</P>
<P>The different durations of antibiotic regimens were also a limitation. The regimens of the three included studies were quite different, and ranged from seven days to two years. This is likely to have contributed to the heterogeneity observed in most analyses.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-23 12:12:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>It is unclear if treating bacteriuria leads to serious complications in children. Other Cochrane reviews of covert bacteriuria have focused on adults, particularly pregnant women who are at increased risk of pyelonephritis, where it appears that treating covert bacteriuria is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2009</LINK>). All three included studies came to similar conclusions: that screening for covert bacteriuria and subsequent treatment with antibiotics was not beneficial. We found no evidence in the included studies that antibiotics reduced symptomatic infection, and there was no evidence of impaired kidney growth in participants (school-aged girls) with radiologically normal kidneys who did not receive treatment.</P>
<P>None of the included studies provided data on adverse events.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-12-29 12:07:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The quality of the evidence was relatively low, mainly due to deficits in reporting. According to GRADE criteria, evidence quality for each outcome was considered to be low or very low (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, because these studies were conducted in the 1970s, some deficits in quality are understandable. For example, intention-to-treat analysis was not commonplace at that time, and was not reported in any included study. Similarly, reporting of baseline characteristics is now mandatory but was not within the scope of studies at that time, and hence, baseline characteristics were not reported in any of the included studies. The small numbers of included studies and participants meant that confidence intervals for most effect estimates were wide, indicating imprecision.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-12-29 12:08:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We attempted to minimise bias by ensuring that two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias. All data were checked after entry.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-29 11:44:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>To our knowledge, there are no existing systematic reviews that investigate asymptomatic bacteriuria in children.</P>
<P>There appears to be general agreement that otherwise healthy school-age children with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics because they are not at increased risk of impaired kidney growth or deterioration in kidney function (<LINK REF="STD-COBSG-1978" TYPE="STUDY">COBSG 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCBRG-1981" TYPE="STUDY">NCBRG 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK>). No evidence was found to indicate that screening is cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-Kemper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemper 1992</LINK>). No studies reporting the benefits and harms of treating asymptomatic children with kidney impairment, or voiding disorders including VUR, were found. There were few studies reporting screening for bacteriuria in radiologically-normal children in whom treatment with antibiotics may be warranted, such as malnourished children (<LINK REF="REF-Bagga-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagga 2003</LINK>), or children with diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Fallahzadeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallahzadeh 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-22 14:59:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The included studies do not provide sufficient detail about the harms and benefits of treating covert bacteriuria to enable forming reliable conclusions. It appears that antibiotic treatment for covert bacteriuria is not likely to offer long-term benefit to children.</P>
<P>Although it is possible to eliminate urinary infections with antibiotics, this does not appear to be an effective course of action in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-23 11:25:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The three included studies were completed at a time when screening for bacteriuria was an important issue, but despite their consistent conclusions, the need for future research is probably not justified. Without evidence of harm, particularly longer-term kidney impairment, it seems unlikely that these studies would be repeated. If future research was to be conducted, adequately powered RCTs that compare culture-sensitive antibiotics with no treatment or placebo, and report longer-term outcomes including recurrence, renal parenchymal damage and antibiotic resistance, should be considered.</P>

<P>During data analysis, we discovered that studies recorded the outcome of persistent bacteriuria at different time periods. To ensure reporting of the most useful data, we split this outcome into persistent bacteriuria at six months, two years and four to five years. Similarly, for recurrent symptomatic bacteriuria, data were split into cystitis and pyelonephritis because this was assumed to be a more clinically useful outcome than symptomatic bacteriuria alone.</P>
<P>We had planned to use both random-effects and fixed effect models; however, because of the significant heterogeneity present in most pooled outcomes, the random-effects model was applied for all analyses.</P>

<LI>Girls with normal IVP and MCUGs received 3 months' treatment and a further 3 months treatment following their first relapse; later relapses received 6 months treatment. Antibiotic treatments were prescribed on the drug sensitivity of the organism and included ampicillin (250 mg four times daily for 2 weeks with no prophylaxis); nitrofurantoin (8 mg/kg/day 2 weeks followed by half this dose prophylactically for the next 10 weeks); or trimethoprim 40 mg + sulphamethoxazole 200 mg three times daily for 2 weeks followed by 10 weeks prophylaxis with 20 to 40 mg trimethoprim and 100 to 200 mg sulphamethoxazole twice daily.</LI>
