<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-17 12:26:47 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>There is little evidence as to how care for hypertensive patients should be organized and delivered in the community to help improve blood pressure control. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of interventions whose objective was to improve follow-up and control of blood pressure in patients taking blood pressure lowering drugs. We included studies that had as population of interest adult patients with essential hypertension in an ambulatory setting. The interventions included all those that aimed to improve blood pressure control. The outcomes assessed were mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, control of blood pressure and the proportion of patients followed up at clinic.</P>
<P>Seventy two randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The range of interventions used included (1) self-monitoring, (2) educational interventions directed to the patient, (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional, (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care, (5) organizational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care, (6) appointment reminder systems. The trials showed a wide variety of methodological quality, part of which may be attributed to poor reporting. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce blood pressure and all-cause mortality in a single large RCT- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Weighted data analysis showed that self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reductions in systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.7 to -1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2 mmHg). Trials of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way of improving control in patients with hypertension, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control, improved systolic blood pressure and more modestly improved diastolic blood pressure, but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (absolute difference 16%, but this pooled result should be treated with caution because of the heterogeneous results from individual RCTs) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73).</P>
<P>We conclude that an organized system of registration, recall and regular review allied to a vigorous stepped care approach to antihypertensive drug treatment appears the most likely way to improve the control of high blood pressure. Health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care and appointment reminder systems requires further evaluation. Education alone, either to health professionals or patients, does not appear to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure.</P>

<P>72 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies varied. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD) -8.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.8 to -7.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -4.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.7 to -3.9 mmHg) for three strata of entry blood pressure, and all-cause mortality at five years follow-up (6.4% versus 7.8%, difference 1.4%) in a single large RCT- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reduction in systolic blood pressure (WMD -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.7 to -1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2 mmHg). RCTs of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way forward, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control and mean SBP and DBP but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems also require further evaluation due to heterogeneity and small trial numbers, but the majority of trials increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-07 08:42:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Liam Glynn">
<P>Family practices and community-based clinics need to have an organized system of regular follow-up and review of their hypertensive patients. Antihypertensive drug therapy should be implemented by means of a vigorous stepped care approach when patients do not reach target blood pressure levels. Self-monitoring and appointment reminders may be useful adjuncts to the above strategies to improve blood pressure control but require further evaluation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-17 12:35:06 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>High blood pressure (hypertension) is an important public health problem in terms of associated stroke and cardiovascular events. It is mostly of unknown aetiology, is easy to diagnose and is readily preventable by blood pressure reduction. Extensive epidemiological data have strengthened the well-recognised relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk and have confirmed the importance of systolic BP as a determinant of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Prospective-Studies-Collaboration-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prospective Studies Collaboration 2002</LINK>). Evidence from randomized trials has shown that effective drug treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gueyffier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueyffier 1999</LINK>). However, there is ongoing concern that the benefits demonstrated in randomized trials of antihypertensive drug treatment are not implemented in everyday clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Burnier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnier 2002</LINK>). Community-based studies throughout the world show that blood pressure goals are achieved in only 25 to 40% of the patients who take antihypertensive drug treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Burnier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1990</LINK>), a situation that has remained unchanged for the last 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Wilber-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilber 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of care patients with hypertension receive from health professionals has a clear impact on their risk of suffering a cardiovascular event. Observational studies in the UK have shown that inadequate control of blood pressure and poor follow-up is associated with a significant risk of stroke and avoidable vascular deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Du-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1993</LINK>). In terms of the process of care that hypertensive patients receive, characteristics of the patient, health professional and the healthcare system in which they are given their medical care have been implicated in poor blood pressure control. Lack of adherence to medication and not having a primary care physician were associated with poor blood pressure control in a US study (<LINK REF="REF-Shea-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1992</LINK>). More recent studies have shown that frequent contact with health care professionals does not guarantee better blood pressure control unless there is more vigorous use of antihypertensive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Hyman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berlowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlowitz 1998</LINK>), and that individual practitioners vary substantially in their clinical performance when managing hypertension in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Frijling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frijling 2001</LINK>). These observations have led some commentators to suggest that poor control of blood pressure in the community may be due to ineffective management and inadequate practice organisation, described jointly as "clinical inertia" (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001</LINK>). Use of self monitoring of blood pressure by patients and professionals has gained popularity and is now recommended in certain patients in some national and international guidelines. A recent meta-analysis of randomised trials on the subject did suggest a benefit in terms of mean blood pressure and blood pressure control (<LINK REF="STD-Cappuccio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cappuccio 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst there is a strong evidence-base for the benefits of antihypertensive drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staessen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 2001</LINK>), there is little clear evidence as to how care for hypertensive patients should be organized and delivered in the community to help improve blood pressure control. This systematic review aims to update and build upon previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; Fahey 2006), to summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials that evaluate different models of care that have been used to improve the control and follow-up of patients with hypertension.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review are to:</P>
<P>(1) Evaluate which models of care are effective in improving "control" of high blood pressure;</P>
<P>(2) Evaluate the effectiveness of reminders on improving the follow-up of patients with hypertension.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-10-07 09:03:54 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Liam Glynn">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized trials of interventions that have sought to evaluate different models of care for patients with hypertension with the overall aim of improving blood pressure control or follow-up care of patients. Included studies had to be RCTs with a contemporaneous control group where patient care in the intervention group(s) was compared with either no intervention or usual care. We excluded studies using interventions not intended to increase blood pressure control by organisational means, particularly drug trials and trials of non-pharmacological treatment.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The population of interest was composed of adult patients (aged 18 years or over) with essential hypertension (treated or not currently treated with blood pressure lowering drugs) in a primary care, outpatient or community setting. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-01-19 01:52:59 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Liam Glynn">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched for primary studies:</P>
<P>a)    The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2007, Issue 4)</P>
<P>b)    English language databases, including MEDLINE (1950-February 2008) and EMBASE (1980-February 2008). </P>
<P>Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining a variation of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms relating to hypertension.  No language restrictions were used.  The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into the other databases using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-17 13:01:51 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Two of the authors (LG and AM) assessed lists of citations and abstracts independently. We were not masked with regard to authors or journal. Each reviewer indicated whether a citation was potentially relevant (i.e. appearing to meet the inclusion criteria), was clearly not relevant, or gave insufficient information to make a judgement. To be included, a study had to meet all the inclusion criteria. We (LG and AM) resolved differences by discussion and final adjudication was performed by TF and SS. We obtained reprints of all potentially relevant citations</P>
<P>We (LG and AM) independently extracted data in duplicate on study design, methods, clinicians and patients, interventions, outcomes and potential sources of bias using a structured data collection form. We wrote to the corresponding authors of studies to request missing data, clarify study details and enquire about unpublished studies.</P>
<P>For assessment of study quality, we collected data on inclusion and exclusion criteria; randomization procedure; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, providers of care and outcome assessors; and losses to follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). We also identified those studies that used a cluster design, which has the potential for unit of analysis errors, and performed a sensitivity analysis excluding those studies which may have been analyzed incorrectly.</P>
<P>We examined the effects on blood pressure between interventions at follow-up (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) according to the six pre-defined intervention categories. We compared and pooled the mean blood pressure differences from baseline to final follow-up in the intervention and control groups using the weighted mean difference approach (see Cochrane Heart Group web site: <A HREF="http://www.epi.bris.ac.uk/cochrane/stats3.html">http://www.epi.bris.ac.uk/cochrane/stats3.html</A>). When only partial information about the variance was provided in RCT reports, we calculated variances using the method described by Follman (<LINK REF="REF-Follman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follman 1992</LINK>). We have taken account of the correlation of baseline and final blood pressure measurements by using empirical data from the Caerphilly data set which examined the correlation between baseline and 5-year follow-up blood pressure measurements in 2000 men (r=0.568 for systolic and r=0.514 for diastolic blood pressure) (personal communication Margaret May, Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol).</P>
<P>For blood pressure control and clinic attendance at follow-up, statistical and clinical significance was evaluated by means of estimating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Individual study definitions of control of blood pressure and attendance at clinic were used. For both continuous and categorical outcomes, we checked the meta-analyses for heterogeneity by visual inspection and by Cochran's test. When heterogeneity is significant, the individual study results are presented to illustrate the magnitude of blood pressure reduction reported but no overall pooled results are presented. Pooled odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated with The Cochrane Collaboration RevMan 5 software.</P>

The pooled results though favouring appointment reminder systems for follow-up of patients (odds ratio of being lost to follow-up 0.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.5) are heterogenous because of the single outlying RCT and the pooled results should be treated with caution.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-17 13:02:52 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>
<B>Key findings from this review<BR/>
</B>The main finding from this systematic review is to a large extent dominated by the findings from the largest RCT, the HDFP study (<LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1982</LINK>). Though partly intended as a trial to assess the value of systematic identification of hypertensive patients (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>), the key ingredients of how patients with established hypertension and taking antihypertensive drug treatment were managed- free care, registration, recall and regular review in tandem with a rigorous stepped care approach to antihypertensive drug treatment- should be emphasized as this multi-faceted intervention was effective in terms of reaching blood pressure goals and reducing all-cause mortality. It is interesting to note that a two-year post trial surveillance study showed that blood pressure control was attenuated when the stepped-care arm of the study was discontinued. This lack of control was associated with a decline in the use of antihypertensive medication (<LINK REF="REF-Hypertension-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hypertension 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other significant finding from this review is that self-monitoring was associated with a decline in systolic blood pressure (2.5 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (1.8 mmHg). Although this blood pressure reduction does not appear substantial in clinical terms, it appears to be nonetheless a useful adjunct to care and is likely to lead to a reduction in cardiovascular events. Further evaluation in larger RCTs and prospective studies including cardiovascular outcomes are warranted. Other interventions assessed in this systematic review did not produce clear results. None of the other interventions were associated with large, clinically important, reductions in either systolic or diastolic pressure, see MetaView. Education alone, directed either to patients or health professionals appears unlikely to influence control of blood pressure as a single intervention, as results were highly heterogeneous or of marginal clinical importance. Use of health care professionals such as nurses and pharmacists, though producing significantly heterogeneous results, did have mainly favourable effects, and merit further definitive evaluation in larger RCTs. Lastly, reminders (postal, computer or telephone based) were associated with an improvement in the follow-up and control of patients with hypertension but produced heterogeneous results in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This finding is consistent with the organisational structure of the HDFP study and re-iterates the importance of systematic recall systems when organising care for hypertensive patients.</P>
<P>
<B>Context of other studies<BR/>
</B>There are elements identified from this review that appear to be associated with improved blood pressure control and are consistent with findings from observational studies and previous systematic reviews. In a large community-based study, patients who received intensive antihypertensive drug therapy were significantly more likely to have reduced systolic blood pressure of 6.3 mmHg compared to an increase of 4.8 mmHg in those who received less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Berlowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlowitz 1998</LINK>). A more recent observational study showed that antihypertensive drug therapy was initiated or changed in only 38% of episodes of care, despite documented uncontrolled hypertension for at least six months (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliveria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveria 2002</LINK>). Lack of practice organisation is associated with a failure to achieve treatment surrogate goals in hypertension, diabetes and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001</LINK>). A recent systematic review of self monitoring also produced similar findings of modest but potentially important benefit in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Cappuccio-2004-errat" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappuccio 2004 errat</LINK>). This is important in light of the fact that self monitoring is now practiced by up to two thirds of the hypertension population in the US and Europe (Pickering 2008). We have found substantially more RCT evidence in terms of hypertension management than a recent systematic review that examined interventions used in disease management programmes for patients with chronic illness (<LINK REF="REF-Weingarten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weingarten 2002</LINK>). In that review, eight hypertension-related RCTs were cited, which provided some evidence of benefit in terms of education directed at the patient and provider (health professional) (<LINK REF="REF-Weingarten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weingarten 2002</LINK>). In this systematic review of 72 RCTs, the subset of RCTs where the intervention was directed at the patient (n=20) or physician (n=10) does not support this finding, showing no clinically important evidence for patient or health professional education as an effective implementation strategy in the management of hypertension.</P>
<P>
<B>Study limitations<BR/>
</B>There are several shortcomings that need to be highlighted in this systematic review. The HDFP study was designed as an intervention that would identify newly diagnosed hypertensive patients and then start or modify antihypertensive treatment in those with untreated as well as uncontrolled hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). A consequence of this study design is that a differential number of people were receiving antihypertensive drug treatment in the two arms. At follow-up in year five, 81.2% of patients in the stepped care arm were taking antihypertensive medication compared to 64.2% of patients in the referred care arm (see details on included studies). So though it appears that the systematic follow-up and stepped care approach in HDFP is an important element in effective clinical care and prompts rigorous antihypertensive drug treatment, it is not possible to distinguish between the independent effect of these interventions on blood pressure control. Several other RCTs included both treated and untreated hypertensive patients and had differential rates of antihypertensive drug prescribing (<LINK REF="STD-Vetter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Midanik-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Midanik 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rudd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ornstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ornstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Contreras-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Contreras 2005</LINK>), with rates of prescribing at higher levels in the intervention arm at follow-up. Secondly, many RCTs contained multi-faceted interventions that did not fit into a single intervention category. For example, several RCTs that were included under categories of patient education, physician education, health professional led care and organisation of care also incorporated some form of reminder intervention such as postal reminders or computer generated feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takala-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Takala 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Takala 1983</LINK>). Consequently, it has been difficult to attribute how far single elements that make up complex interventions exert their independent effect on blood pressure control. In terms of self monitoring, it is well established that "office" blood pressure readings are around 10/5mmHg higher when compared to ambulatory or self monitored readings (<LINK REF="REF-Staessen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2004</LINK>). Several of the RCTs did not make any recommendations about the need for adjustment of target blood pressure readings when self monitoring was the intervention being assessed, nor did they appear to anticipate lower blood pressure readings in the self monitoring group (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1984</LINK>; Baqu&#8218;Äö 2005). This may have attenuated the impact of self monitoring on blood pressure control because of failure to intensify treatment. Poor adherence to therapy is thought to be associated with poor control of blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Shea-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1992</LINK>) and medication adherence in hypertension is estimated to be only around 50% to 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>). Yet only a few trials examined the relationship between adherence to medication and control of blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackett-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sackett 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sookaneknun-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sookaneknun 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Castro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Castro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wetzels-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzels 2007</LINK>) despite the significant influence that adherence may have on blood pressure control. Future studies will need to be designed to assess the relationship between poor adherence and poor response to antihypertensive drugs in patients with good adherence. Cluster design was used in 14 of the 71 randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. The majority (8) of these trials correctly adjusted for clustering effect. However, in those six trials that did not, the potential exists for unit of analysis errors. However, sensitivity analysis excluding those studies did not significantly alter our main results. Lastly, not all RCTs reported on the outcomes of blood pressure achieved or blood pressure control. This has meant that the relevant a priori outcomes have not been reported for all included RCTs, and pooling of data from all RCTs has not been possible. Two further trials were identified which were published outside the search dates and thus were not included in the analysis. The first was a 2 × 2 randomized controlled trial with two year follow-up comparing two self-management interventions for improving BP control among 636 hypertensive patients in two university-affiliated primary care clinics (<LINK REF="REF-Bosworth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosworth 2009</LINK>). Patients received usual care, a behavioral intervention (bimonthly tailored nurse-administered telephone intervention targeting hypertension-related behaviours), home BP monitoring three times weekly, or the behavioral intervention plus home BP monitoring. Combined home BP monitoring and tailored behavioral telephone intervention improved BP control, systolic BP, and diastolic BP at 24 months relative to usual care. The success of this combination of self-monitoring and nurse-led care appears to consolidate some of the findings of our review. The second was a randomized controlled trial in<SUP> </SUP>14 community pharmacies in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, of 227 patients<SUP> </SUP>with diabetes who had BPs higher than 130/80 mm Hg on two consecutive<SUP> </SUP>visits two weeks apart (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 2008</LINK>). In patients who had diabetes and hypertension<SUP> </SUP>that were relatively well controlled, a pharmacist and nurse<SUP> </SUP>team based intervention resulted in a clinically important<SUP> </SUP>improvement in BP.<SUP> </SUP>

<P>Despite these limitations important messages emerge from this systematic review. Effective delivery of hypertensive care requires a systematic approach in the community, incorporating regular review of patients and a willingness to intensify antihypertensive drug treatment, usually by adding additional classes of antihypertensive drugs, when blood pressure goals are not being met (<LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hypertension-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hypertension 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). This approach of intensive drug therapy and "tight" control of blood pressure has been demonstrated to be possible in clinical trials in hypertensive and diabetic patients alike (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-PDS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UK PDS 1998</LINK>). There are reports of successful systematic care of hypertensive patients in the community over a 20 year period (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1991</LINK>), but the challenge is to translate these findings into usual clinical care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-17 12:56:48 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>In terms of future studies, careful preliminary work is needed when developing and testing complex interventions and thought needs to be given as to how their individual and combined effects are measured (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>). Aside from definitive RCTs examining the effects of self-monitoring and allied health professional led care (pharmacist and nurses), there is also a paucity of evidence in terms of computer-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in hypertension and how adherence-enhancing strategies influence subsequent blood pressure control (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>). HDFP was a well-funded study with substantial staffing resources. This meant that the "stepped care" intervention was provided by a highly motivated workforce. An economic evaluation of delivering organised care to hypertensive patients should accompany future studies. Lastly, none of the included RCTs attempted to manage hypertension in the context of overall cardiovascular risk. Future studies need to be congruent with hypertension guidelines that recommend treatment and control of blood pressure in combination with multi-factorial risk reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions<BR/>
</B>Effective delivery of hypertension care in the community requires a rigorous approach in terms of identification, follow-up and treatment with antihypertensive drugs. This systematic review shows that such an approach is likely to translate into reductions in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hypertension-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hypertension 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hypertension-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hypertension 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). Supplementary and alternative models of care, including self monitoring of blood pressure by patients, blood pressure management by allied health care professionals and CDSSs require further development and evaluation. Educational interventions directed to either patients or health professionals alone are unlikely to produce clinically important reductions in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.</P>

<P>A total of 258 patients with high BP despite use of antihypertensive medication were randomly assigned to either continuation of usual care (with adjustment in antihypertensive medication if necessary) or to the introduction of electronic monitoring. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was monitored for 2 months without medication changes.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-08-04 07:42:26 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Liam Glynn">
<P>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who reached target BP levels after a 5-month follow-up period. </P>
<P>At 5 months, 50.6% of the patients in the usual care group reached adequate BP, v 53.7% in the electronic monitoring group (P = .73). The percentages of patients with drug additions or increases in dosage were higher in the usual care group compared with those in whom adherence was monitored (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: These data show that electronic monitoring in comparison to usual care results in similar BP control but leads to fewer drug changes and less drug use. This result is likely to be achieved by improving adherence. Hence a strategy that includes electronic monitoring has the potential to prevent unnecessary treatment escalation in patients with poor adherence</P>
