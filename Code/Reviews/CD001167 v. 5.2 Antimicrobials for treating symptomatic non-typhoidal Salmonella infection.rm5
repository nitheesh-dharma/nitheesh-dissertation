<P>Non-typhoidal <I>Salmonella</I> (NTS) can cause diarrhoea in people. In this review, we investigated the benefits and safety of antibiotics for treatment of NTS versus placebo or no antibiotic treatment. We found that in otherwise healthy people, treatment with antibiotics did not have any benefit over treatment with no antibiotics. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics made it more likely that patients would continue to excrete the same organisms for up to one month after treatment. We are unable to comment on the use of antibiotics in very young people, very old people and people who are unable to fight off infection because the trials we identified did not include these patients.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-05 09:20:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (up to August 2012), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) published in <I>The Cochrane Library (</I>up to Issue 8 2012); and MEDLINE, African Index Medicus, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Science Citation Index, all up to 6 August 2012.

<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea caused by NTS species with placebo or no antibiotic treatment. We selected trials that included people of all ages who were symptomatic for NTS infection. Examples of symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. We excluded trials where the outcomes were not reported separately for the NTS subgroup of patients. Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria prior to study inclusion.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-05 09:23:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants; very low quality evidence). No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoea at five to seven days after treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; two trials, 192 participants; very low quality evidence), clinical failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25; seven trials, 440 participants; very low quality evidence). The mean difference for diarrhoea was 0 days (95% CI -0.54 to 0.54; 202 participants, four studies; low quality evidence);for fever was 0.27 days (95% CI -0.11 to 0.65; 107 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence); and for duration of illness was 0 days (95% CI -0.68 to 0.68; 116 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). Quinolone antibiotic treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment (microbiological failure: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.56; 166 participants, four trials).</P>
<P>Antibiotic treatment meant passage of the same <I>Salmonella</I> serovar one month after treatment was almost twice as likely (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.98; 112 participants, three trials), which was statistically significant. Non-severe adverse drug reactions were more common among the patients who received antibiotic treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-30 15:57:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infection with <I>Salmonella</I> bacteria can cause typhoid fever in people if they are infected with <I>Salmonella enterica enterica</I>, serovar Typhi (<I>S</I>. Typhi) or <I>S. enterica enterica</I>, serovar Paratyphi (<I>S</I>. Paratyphi) A, B and C. Non-typhoidal <I>Salmonella </I>(NTS)<I> </I>disease is caused if the infectious agent is any of the NTS serovars, such as <I>S. enterica enterica</I>, serovar<I> </I>Enteritidis, or <I>S. enterica enterica</I>, serovar<I> </I>Typhimurium<B>. </B>This review focuses on NTS infection, which can present as either an invasive disease or as enterocolitis with diarrhoea. Another Cochrane Review studied treatments for typhoid fever (<LINK REF="REF-Effa-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effa 2011</LINK>). This review examines the currently available body of evidence regarding antibiotic treatment of NTS infection. This review is an update of part of an earlier review which investigated the use of antibiotics for the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic NTS infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sirinavin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirinavin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>NTS infection is an important cause of food poisoning in most areas of the world. The disease is often under-reported as affected people can sometimes be asymptomatic and hence do not go to the hospital for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rabsch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabsch 2001</LINK>). In the USA, an estimated 1.4 million people suffer from the disease annually, of which about 80,000 to 160,000 seek medical attention, approximately 16,000 are hospitalized and about 600 people die from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 1999</LINK>). Invasive disease due to <I>Salmonella enterica</I> <I>enterica</I> serovar Typhi as well as NTS is common in children younger than five years old in developing countries, particularly in many places in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Animals are a major reservoir of NTS infection. The infection is mainly acquired by eating contaminated food, such as poultry, beef and eggs. However, it can also be transmitted by handling farm animals, like chickens. Infection can be passed transovarially from chickens to their eggs. Furthermore, bacteria can be spread by pets, including snakes. There has been a report of fatal <I>Salmonella</I> sepsis following platelet transfusion from an asymptomatic donor who acquired the infection from his pet boa constrictor (<LINK REF="REF-Jafari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jafari 2002</LINK>). <I>Salmonella </I>bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person by the faecal-oral route, by direct contact with a contaminated person or fomites, medicines and rarely by aerosols (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the findings of a prospective study in Africa highlighted the importance of person-to-person transmission in Kenya (<LINK REF="REF-Kariuki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kariuki 2006</LINK>), animal-to-human transmission is still recognised as being more important in accounting for the current epidemiological patterns of NTS.  </P>
<P>Certain host factors, such as gastric acidity, can give some protection from NTS infection and infection usually requires large bacterial inocula. However, in people whose host defence mechanisms have been compromised, for example those on acid-suppressing drugs, patients with pernicious anaemia and infants, there is a higher risk of NTS infection. Notably, liquids which pass through the stomach quickly, or milk and cheese that raise the pH, enable smaller inocula to be infective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Features               </HEADING>
<P>NTS infection can manifest in two distinct forms: either as an enterocolitis with diarrhoea or as an invasive disease, which can occur without diarrhoea. The latter form is particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
<P>The syndrome of enterocolitis is more often present in developed countries and usually manifests with diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramps, and sometimes fever. Symptoms usually start between six to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria (but can sometimes be delayed for up a week) and tend to resolve within five to seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Hohmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohmann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MDH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">MDH 2007</LINK>). In general the incubation period depends on the immune system of the host and the bacterial inoculum size. Infection can cause acute severe diarrhoea or chronic and prolonged diarrhoea, which can result in the disturbance of fluid and electrolyte balances (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2000</LINK>). NTS infection can be severe, invasive and recurrent in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), resulting in up to 47% mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kankwatira-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kankwatira 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The infection can sometimes be invasive when it causes bacteraemia (bacteria in the bloodstream) or has extraintestinal manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ispahani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ispahani 2000</LINK>). About 2% to 45% of people with diarrhoea may develop bacteraemia (bacteria in the bloodstream) with fever (<LINK REF="REF-Zapor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zapor 2005</LINK>), while some may develop bacteraemia without diarrhoeal episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2007</LINK>). NTS can cause life-threatening infection in some individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS. Recurrent <I>Salmonella</I> septicaemia is one of the conditions that defines the AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2007</LINK>). Children with sickle cell anaemia are particularly at risk of NTS osteomyelitis.<BR/>
<BR/>Extraintestinal manifestations can result in complications, with various clinical focal syndromes affecting the meninges, bones, joints, adrenal gland, aorta, inner lining of the heart, the kidneys/urinary tract, and the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-Dorado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez Dorado 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zapor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zapor 2005</LINK>). The risk factors for invasive disease in adults and children include immunosuppression of any cause, including HIV-positive status, malaria infection, severe anaemia, or malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Morpeth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morpeth 2009</LINK>). The development of extraintestinal focal infections is associated with higher mortality rates, more severe septic manifestations, longer hospital stays and a longer duration of antimicrobial therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to further understand the molecular biology of the NTS strains responsible for invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa, multilocus sequence analysis of certain strains of <I>S.</I> Typhimurium from patients in Kenya and Malawi was performed. A dominant genotype, ST 313, was identified which is responsible for many cases of the invasive disease. ST 313 isolates harbour genome signatures that differentiate them from <I>S.</I> Typhimurium causing gastroenteritis in other regions of the world. These include a novel repertoire of prophage elements and evidence of genome degradation (<LINK REF="REF-Kingsley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingsley 2009</LINK>). In Africa, ST 313 infection presents as a separate clinical entity with generalized sepsis and focal infection due to its adaptability to the human host.</P>
<P>Some people may have infection caused by NTS without showing any symptoms of the disease while excreting the organism in their stool (asymptomatic carriers) (<LINK REF="REF-Jertborn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jertborn 1990</LINK>). In certain cases following recovery from symptoms of the disease, individuals continue to excrete NTS bacteria in their stools (convalescent carriers) (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 1984</LINK>). These carrier states can be for a short period of time. However, excretion of the organism may be prolonged especially in children aged less than five years old and can persist for more than a year (chronic carriers) (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2000</LINK>). A carrier is considered cured from the first day of three consecutive negative stool cultures (ie when the <I>Salmonella</I> is absent in the stool), and this may be difficult to achieve with antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Carlstedt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carlstedt 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Salmonellosis is diagnosed by isolating <I>Salmonella</I> bacteria from the stool, blood (if associated with bacteraemia and extraintestinal infection) (<LINK REF="REF-Kankwatira-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kankwatira 2004</LINK>), or, less commonly, urine (if there is a focal infection of the urinary tract) (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-Dorado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez Dorado 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallenas-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallenas 1985</LINK>). <I>Salmonella</I> bacteria can also be isolated from bone marrow aspirates. The bacterial concentration in bone marrow can sometimes be as much as 10 times that in peripheral blood. In patients who have received antibiotic treatment, the bacteria may still be found in the bone marrow even when it may no longer be present in the blood when cultured.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-08 10:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antimicrobial agents are either natural or synthetic substances which can kill or inhibit the growth of microbial organisms. They are generally described based on their mechanism of action which may determine if a particular antibiotic may be clinically useful for the treatment of an infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-27 13:48:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several reasons why clinicians have concerns regarding the use of antibiotics to treat NTS infection. Antibiotic use may not result in rapid control of symptoms or stop the excretion of the bacteria in stools. Instead it may lengthen the time period that bacteria are excreted in the stools, thereby increasing the risk of infecting other people (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2003</LINK>). Concerns about the development of antibiotic resistance have limited their use for NTS treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hakanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakanen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molbak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molbak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panhotra-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panhotra 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1997</LINK>) and infection with multiple-drug resistant strains of NTS has been noted to result in higher mortality and morbidity rates.</P>
<P>There have been several reports regarding the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of NTS, particularly following the increased and more widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of NTS infection in livestock. The number of cases appears to be increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Frost-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frost 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hakanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakanen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molbak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molbak 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Notably, some people continue to carry S<I>almonella</I> bacteria even after the antibiotics have treated the symptoms. For example, the previous version of this Cochrane Review showed that antibiotic treatment may result in more negative stool cultures especially during the first week of treatment, with more positive stool cultures after the third week of treatment due to relapse of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sirinavin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirinavin 2000</LINK>). Also, there are risks of adverse drug reactions to these antibiotics, such as skin rash with ampicillin, leucopenia with co-trimoxazole, and urticaria, severe headache, nausea, epigastric pain, and dizziness with fluoroquinolones (<LINK REF="REF-Reese-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reese 1991</LINK>). There are also concerns regarding the use of quinolones in young children because of the risk of tendonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Yee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yee 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>This review is an update of certain aspects of a previous Cochrane Review, which investigated the use of antibiotics for treating <I>Salmonella</I> gut infections in both symptomatic and asymptomatic people (<LINK REF="REF-Sirinavin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirinavin 2000</LINK>). Since the review, the use of new antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones for adults and third-generation cephalosporins for children, has become more widespread and new trials have been conducted using these drug interventions. In this review, we have focused our investigation on NTS symptomatic patients only. We have updated the review methods to reflect recent methodological changes and we searched for new trials taking into account these changes.</P>

<P>Two authors (IO, CO) independently screened the results (titles and abstracts) of the literature search for potentially relevant trials. We retrieved full text articles of the potentially relevant trials and independently determined whether they met the review inclusion criteria using a pre-tested eligibility form. For each step of the review, we resolved contentious issues through discussion. We consulted an editor from the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group where necessary. We also attempted to contact trial authors for further information where trial eligibility was unclear. We have listed all excluded studies along with the reason for exclusion (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-09-26 19:13:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors (IO, CO) independently extracted data using a pre-tested data extraction form. One author (CO) entered the data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK> while a second author (IO) cross-checked the data for completeness and accuracy. We extracted data concerning the number of participants randomized and the number of participants analyzed in each group for each reported outcome. For dichotomous outcomes we extracted data concerning the total number of participants randomized, the number of participants experiencing the events and number of participants in each treatment group. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants for each treatment arm, arithmetic means and standard deviations. Where we encountered data with skewed distribution, we extracted geometric means and standard deviations on the log scale where geometric means were reported, or medians and ranges if medians were reported. For rate and count outcomes (such as participants with outcomes that occurred more than once over the period of trial), we extracted the number of events or episodes experienced in each trial arm and person-time over which the events were experienced for each group. We extracted hazard ratios and standard deviations for time-to-event outcomes (such as the development of life-threatening extraintestinal focal infection). We extracted data on reported adverse events. We contacted the trial authors where the relevant details were not recorded or were unclear. We resolved any disagreements regarding data extraction through discussion and by asking the third review author to attempt data extraction. If necessary, we also sought assistance from an editor with the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-05 09:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (IO, CO) assessed the risk of bias independently according to the specifications of the latest edition of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We independently assessed the risk of bias within each included study in relation to the following five domains:sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting by using the ratings of 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias).</P>
<P>Details of specific assessments are as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We analysed continuous data if means and standard deviations were available. Where mean differences were provided, we extracted and utilized these values for the analysis irrespective of whether mean and standard deviation values were provided as we were interested in post-intervention values. We re-calculated the standard deviation values in instances where the standard error was reported. Also, we extracted data from studies that reported adequately on skewed continuous data as medians rather than means. Where appropriate, we have reported these data separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Binary data</HEADING>
<P>We analysed binary outcomes by calculating the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>When necessary, we attempted to contact the study author(s) to supply any unreported data (eg group means and standard deviations (SDs), details of dropouts, and details of interventions received by the control group). If a study reported outcomes for participants that completed the trial only or for participants who followed the protocol only, we contacted authors to provide additional information to facilitate intention-to-treat analyses. In instances where this was not possible we performed a complete case analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), which describes approximately the proportion of total variation that is due to variation between studies. In addition, we employed the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test of homogeneity at 10% level of statistical significance to determine the strength of evidence against the hypothesis that all studies come from the same population. An I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic value of between 0% and 40% may not be significant; of between 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; of between 50% to 90% may represent statistical heterogeneity; and between 75% and 100% may indicate considerable heterogeneity. We also inspected forest plots, as poor overlap may be due to significant heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>We had planned that if there are more than 10 trials in a comparison, we will prepare funnel plots (estimated treatment effects against their standard error) to explore publication bias. Asymmetry could be due to publication bias, but can also be due to a relationship between trial size and effect size. As we did not identify at least 10 trials for any comparison, we did not prepare funnel plots to explore publication bias.</P>

<P>We planned to assess important clinical heterogeneity by comparing the distribution of important clinical (study participants, study setting, type of intervention and co-intervention) and methodological (randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, losses to follow up) heterogeneity factors.

One study (n = 168) included all ages (<LINK REF="STD-Joint-Project--ASID-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Joint Project ASID 1970</LINK>). Almost all studies excluded pregnant patients and those with underlying diseases, previous antibiotic treatment, severe illness and history of allergy to the group of study drug. One study included malnourished children (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-de-Olarte-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia de Olarte 1974</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Eleven studies involved sporadic cases of patients presenting for treatment of either acute diarrhoea or travellers' diarrhoea. One study reported an outbreak in hospital personnel in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Neil-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Neil 1991</LINK>). Randomization was conducted on diarrhoeal patients prior to culture results being available in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-de-Olarte-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia de Olarte 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazemi-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Kazemi 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Neil 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistrom-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wistrom 1992</LINK>).

For assessment of microbiological failure, we used data that combined both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients as the distribution of asymptomatic patients was similar in both the treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>Duration of diarrhoea preceding entry to the study varied between the included studies, however the duration was similar between control and experimental groups in each study. In eleven studies, the history was short (&lt; 7 days). One study had a range of between 1 to 34 days (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1980</LINK>). One study did not specifically state the duration (<LINK REF="STD-Joint-Project--ASID-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Joint Project ASID 1970</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-de-Olarte-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia de Olarte 1974</LINK> included patients who were less than and more than seven days with the diarrhoea. In one study, patients were randomized on the ninth day following onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Neil-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Neil 1991</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Studies were from Europe and Scandinavia (four studies), North America (four studies), Australia (one study) Taiwan (one study). There were two international multicentre studies: one included Italy, Thailand, Indonesia, Ivory coast, Mexico and Israel and the second included Asia, South America and Italy. There was one study from Colombia.<BR/>
<BR/>Exact <I>Salmonella</I> serovars were not reported in all of the studies. The outbreak assessed in <LINK REF="STD-Neil-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Neil 1991</LINK> was caused by <I>S. java</I>. About 90% of culture positive cases were caused by <I>S. enteritidis</I> in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pitkajarvi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkajarvi 1996</LINK>), and by <I>S. typhimurium</I> in another (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1954</LINK>).

Not all of the studies reported adverse events. Some studies reported adverse events as overall events in all diarrhoeal patients randomized to comparative groups (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-de-Olarte-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia de Olarte 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joint-Project--ASID-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Joint Project ASID 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1954</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-05 09:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review suggest that antibiotics may not be of clinical benefit for the treatment of NTS diarrhoea. We were unable to demonstrate any statistically significant effect of antibiotic treatment on any of our clinical outcomes of intervention efficacy. Antibiotic administration appeared to increase the risk of microbiological relapse and fecal carriage at follow-up in patients who were treated compared to those who were either not treated or treated with placebo. Although no serious adverse events were reported among the patients in our included studies, a slightly higher number of other adverse events were associated with the use of antibiotics as compared with placebo or no treatment. Although most of the authors did not report statistically significant differences between the antibiotic and placebo groups, the observed adverse events are of enough clinical significance to discourage antibiotic use, particularly when its use is of questionable benefit.</P>
<P>These findings are of importance both from clinical and public health perspectives. Routine antibiotic administration for the treatment of NTS diarrhoea could potentially worsen disease transmission in the community as many of the treated patients could go on to excrete pathogens for longer periods than they normally would if they were not treated with antibiotics. This would have some impact on the incidence of acute bacterial diarrhoeal episodes. There is also the potential for the spread of resistant strains with the use of unnecessary antibiotics. The question regarding the appropriateness or otherwise of antibiotic administration with regard to NTS diarrhoea is one that has been controversial with respect to the findings that have been made in studies that have attempted to answer this question.</P>
<P>Notably, the actual number of patients in the included studies and subsequent meta-analysis were few and when taken alone, may not be enough to detect a statistically and clinically meaningful difference. However, the direction of effect was fairly consistent across the studies in the review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-26 19:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies we included in this review were mostly those that studied patients with acute bacterial diarrhoea, and we extracted data from the NTS subgroup. The studies did not assess the impact of antibiotics on severe diarrhoeal illness caused by <I>Salmonella</I>, as severe illness was an exclusion criteria in almost all of the studies. One of our included studies evaluated malnourished children, but no studies evaluated other immunocompromised people (people with AIDS, or other immunocompromising conditions). In one of the trials, immunocompromised people were specifically excluded. We therefore cannot answer the question as to the benefit or otherwise of antibiotic intervention in this group of patients. We could also not answer the question as to the benefit or otherwise of antibiotic administration in very young or very old people as most of the studies did not include these patients at all. In studies where they were included the numbers were very few and outcome assessments were not reported separately. We were therefore unable to perform a subgroup analysis on this category of patients.<BR/>
<BR/>One of the potential risks of intestinal salmonellosis in young infants is extraintestinal infection. No study reported on this outcome and this review is unable to provide information as regards the effects of antibiotics on this outcome in children. There was no study of the effect of a fluoroquinolone in infants and young children, partly because of safety concerns stemming from the observed effects on cartilage in animals.</P>
<P>A major concern regarding treatment with fluoroquinolones, and indeed all antibiotics, is the risk of emergence of resistance and outbreaks of infections due to resistant organisms, which could potentially cause serious extraintestinal infections in high risk groups.</P>
<P>Notably, we may have missed studies that assessed people with diarrhoea that included patients with <I>Salmonella</I> but did not refer to this group of patients in its title/abstract or MESH etc, but only in the full text or tables.</P>

<P>Our review utilized evidence from RCTs. Some of the data that we have included in the meta-analysis are skewed and so our overall effect estimates must be interpreted with caution.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-09-26 19:58:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We faced challenges in our data extraction, and assessment of the intervention effect on our pre-specified outcomes as a result of the generally poor quality of reporting of some of the outcomes in the trials, particularly with regard to the consistent reporting of continuous outcomes. Also, the included trials and some of the excluded trials could have contributed more to the review if the authors had performed subgroup analysis with respect to the isolated pathogens after stool culture. This would help to better elucidate the pattern of antimicrobial drug efficacy in the treatment of bacterial diarrhoea.</P>

<P>This review is still affected by some of the methodological issues in the included trials in the earlier version of the review. However, the results of our review is in agreement with the previous review.</P>
<P>Only one new trial is now available that was not available at the time of the 1999 review. None of the identified trials have investigated invasive NTS disease. This highlights the need for more research into other aspects of NTS infection.</P>

<P>We are unable to demonstrate a positive clinical effect of antibiotic therapy on the treatment of NTS diarrhoea in people with non-severe diarrhoea. Adverse drug reactions, although minimal, do occur with antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic administration, therefore, should not be routinely recommended. For patients with some underlying immunosuppressive disorder, or in patients who are very young or very old, current data are insufficient to make a conclusive statement as regards appropriate management.</P>
<P>Antibiotic therapy appears to result in early negative stool cultures, but higher rates of relapse afterwards.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-27 14:34:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unable to comment on the effects of antibiotic therapy on NTS intestinal infection in the high-risk groups for extraintestinal invasion (infants, elderly and immuno-compromised patients) and on severe diarrhoea. There is a need for further randomized, placebo controlled trials in these patients. These trials would have to be adequately powered to enable the detection of clinically meaningful effects and multicentre collaboration may be beneficial.</P>
<P>New antibiotics with potential for therapeutic usefulness in treatment of symptomatic <I>Salmonella</I> infection need to be investigated in the context of RCTs. One of the identified but excluded trials evaluated the use of rifaximin but could not be included in the review because the number of NTS patients was very small and included with other patients.</P>
<P>These trials can proceed to study all patients with bacterial diarrhoea but would perform subgroup analysis by the isolated pathogen. These trials need to include enough patients to be able to have statistical power and also need to study the patients long enough (for at least 8 to 10 weeks) to enable a clearer picture to be obtained as regards microbiological failure and detection of the same <I>Salmonella</I> serovar 1 to 2 months after treatment. Also these studies would need to continue to examine the stool cultures even after they become initially culture negative as this would enable it detect patients who relapse after treatment.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> Downgraded by one for risk of bias: allocation concealment was not adequately described in any of these studies.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> No serious indirectness: these four trials have tested standard doses of chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, azithromycin, and cefixime. Most of the patients were children and severe cases have generally been excluded.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Downgraded by one for imprecision: each of these antibiotics have only been tested in a single trial, and these trials are too small to confidently exclude the possibility of an effect.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No serious indirectness: these two trials have tested four different antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin and cefixime. One trial was in adults and one in children.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Downgraded by two for imprecision: each antibiotic was evaluated in a single small trial, with too few patients to confidently detect or exclude clinically important benefits or harms<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Downgraded by one for indirectness: one trial testing chloramphenicol is now over 50 years old. The remaining trial has only tested ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> Dowgraded by one for inconsistency: one trial of norfloxacin did show a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo. However this result should be repeated before concluding that norfloxacin is beneficial.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> Downgraded by one for imprecision: these trials are individually small and tested different antibiotics. Even the cumulative sample size remains underpowered to confidently exclude benefits.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> Downgraded by one for indirectness: these two studies have only tested norfloxacin and fleroxacin. Clinically important benefit with alternative antibiotics cannot be excluded.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Downgraded by one for indirectness: these two trials have only evaluated ampicillin and norfloxacin.</P>
