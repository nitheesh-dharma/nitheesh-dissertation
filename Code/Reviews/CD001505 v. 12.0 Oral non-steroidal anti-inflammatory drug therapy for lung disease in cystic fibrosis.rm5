<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:12:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed evidence to see if drugs that weren't steroids could reduce inflammation in the lungs and stop lung function getting worse in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Inflammation in the lungs increases the damage done to them and is the most common reason for early death in people with cystic fibrosis. In high doses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen, may work against inflammation, but in low doses there is some evidence that they may cause the inflammation. The use of high doses has also raised concerns about the potential for unwanted effects, which has limited the use of these drugs in cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 04 February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for trials comparing oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to a a placebo (a tablet that contained no active medicine). We looked for any dose level. but the trial had to run for at least two months in people with cystic fibrosis. We found 10 trials and included four of these with a total of 287 people aged five to 39 years; one trial has not yet been published in full and we will assess this when we have more information. Three of the included trials compared ibuprofen to a placebo; two of these trials were run in the same centre and used some of the same people. One trial compared a drug called piroxicam to placebo. The longest trial lasted four years.</P>
<P>We aimed to report on lung function, nutritional status, lung x-rays, how often intravenous antibiotics were needed, details about hospital admissions, survival and side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We could combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials and showed that volunteers taking ibuprofen had a significantly lower annual rate of decline in lung function which was consistent across three different ways of measuring the outcome. We then decided to look at these results split by age (even though we did not originally plan to do this) and found that two of the lung function measurements showed a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline in lung function in younger children. In one trial, long-term use of a high dose of ibuprofen was linked to less need for intravenous antibiotics, better nutritional status and healthier lungs as seen by x-ray. No major side effects were reported in the trials, but they had not been designed to show differences in the rates of side effects.</P>
<P>To summarise, we found evidence showing that a high dose of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, most notably ibuprofen, can slow the progression of lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in younger people. The long-term safety data are limited but we feel that there is enough evidence to recommend that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be temporarily stopped when people with cystic fibrosis are receiving intravenous aminoglycosides or other drugs that may badly damage the kidneys.</P>
<P>The piroxicam trial did not report many results in a form that we could analyse in the review. We did not have any results for our main outcome of lung lung function. The only results we had reported no difference between the piroxicam group and the placebo group for the number of hospital admissions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We thought the three ibuprofen trials had a good or adequate level of methodological quality with little risk of bias to the results, but used a range of different outcomes and summary measures. We did not have any concerns with regards to risks of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:11:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The searches identified 10 trials; four are included (287 participants aged five to 39 years; maximum follow up of four years) and one is currently awaiting classification pending publication of the full trial report. Three trials compared ibuprofen to placebo (two from the same centre with some of the same participants); one trial assessed piroxicam versus placebo.</P>
<P>The three ibuprofen trials were deemed to have good or adequate methodological quality, but used various outcomes and summary measures. Reviewers considered measures of lung function, nutritional status, radiological assessment of pulmonary involvement, intravenous antibiotic usage, hospital admissions, survival and adverse effects. Combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials showed a significantly lower annual rate of decline for lung function, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second mean difference 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 2.42); forced vital capacity mean difference 1.27 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 2.28); forced expiratory flow (25-75%) mean difference 1.80 (95% confidence interval 0.15 to 3.45). The post-hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline of percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity in the ibuprofen group in younger children, mean difference 1.41% (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.80) and mean difference 1.32% (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 2.60) respectively. In one trial, long-term use of high-dose ibuprofen was associated with reduced intravenous antibiotic usage, improved nutritional and radiological pulmonary status. No major adverse effects were reported, but the power of the trials to identify clinically important differences in the incidence of adverse effects was low.</P>
<P>We did not have any concerns with regards to risk of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo. However, the trial did not report many data in a form that we could analyse in this review. No data were available for the review's primary outcome of lung function; available data for hospital admissions showed no difference between the groups. No analysable data were available for any other review outcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-05 13:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-23 16:13:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common recessively inherited genetic condition affecting Caucasian populations. It is estimated that, among Northern Europeans, one person out of 25 is a carrier of a CF gene and that one child out of every 2500 born is affected, with other populations affected to a lesser extent (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 1998</LINK>). The most important clinical manifestation in CF is progressive pulmonary deterioration, which is associated with recurrent lower respiratory tract illnesses, respiratory failure and death. As morbidity and mortality among those with CF is largely a consequence of these respiratory complications, the pathogenesis of respiratory disease in CF and the prevention of pulmonary deterioration are important therapeutic goals.</P>
<P>The role of airway inflammation in mediating lung injury among those with CF has received increasing attention (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1997</LINK>). Persistent infection of the airways with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>), <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> or <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> is thought to contribute to a hyperactive inflammatory response, with cytokines, proteases, oxygen radicals and elastase being released profusely once infection is established (<LINK REF="REF-Chmiel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chmiel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). These mediators of inflammation are likely to make an important contribution to airway damage. In addition, persistent stimulation of the immune system leads to high serum and tissue IgG levels, accompanied by extensive neutrophil infiltration. This combination of cellular and biochemical events form part of a cascade of inflammation which is associated with progressive and irreversible airway damage in CF.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-18 12:51:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are agents that affect the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, resulting in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and, at high doses, ibuprofen also affects the lipoxygenase pathway. However, uncertainty remains regarding the exact mode of action of ibuprofen and it has been suggested that, at low doses, ibuprofen may be pro-inflammatory (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 2003</LINK>). Mean peak plasma concentrations of greater than 50 micrograms per milliliter (&#956;g/mL) have been associated with maximal anti-inflammatory effect. A potentially narrow therapeutic window for ibuprofen may exist, as experimental work in animals and humans suggests that low plasma concentrations may be associated with a paradoxical increase in inflammation. In view of this, the importance of maintaining high plasma levels in the therapeutic range based on pharmacokinetic trials and careful pharmacological monitoring to devise optimal individual dosing schedules has been stressed.</P>
<P>Difficulties in access to pharmacological assays with which to optimise individual dosing schedules, combined with concerns regarding potential adverse effects of NSAIDs, may be important considerations. Recent debates in literature about safety of low-dose NSAIDs and cardiovascular disease further highlights the need for careful monitoring of pharmacokinetic levels. The likelihood of adverse events among people with CF may be increased in the presence of impaired liver or renal function, and these in turn may influence plasma levels of potentially toxic co-therapy such as, for example, with aminoglycosides. This emphasises the importance of assessing these consequences adequately within the context of randomized trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-05 13:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>As pulmonary damage in CF may occur as a consequence of inflammation, it has been hypothesized that prolonged use of NSAIDs may prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration and respiratory morbidity.</P>
<P>Previous trials have provided circumstantial evidence in support of this hypothesis. In the Wheeler trial, the authors observed that, among young children with CF, respiratory status was better in those with very low serum IgG levels compared to age-matched CF children with normal or elevated serum IgG (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1984</LINK>). Konstan infected a group of rats with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> and then treated them with either ibuprofen or placebo for 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1990</LINK>). The active treatment group had 30% less lung inflammation than the placebo-treated group. Although the rat model for pulmonary infection with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is different from human CF in many ways, the above results offer further support for the hypotheses that:</P>
<OL>
<LI>there is an immunological or inflammatory component to lung function decline in CF; and</LI>
<LI>treatment with NSAIDs may delay progression of Pseudomonas-related lung disease in people with CF.</LI>
</OL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-18 10:23:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This systematic review aims to establish whether administering oral high-dose NSAIDs to people with CF alters the pattern of change in specific clinical markers of CF-related disease progression. Specifically, it aims to explore the extent to which existing evidence supports a beneficial effect of NSAIDs on lung function and respiratory morbidity in people with CF. The potential negative effects of such treatment, especially when given over prolonged periods, will also be considered. Recognized adverse effects of NSAIDs include: minor and major haemorrhage (life-threatening gastrointestinal bleed, haemorrhagic stroke); gastrointestinal upset (dyspepsia, nausea); diarrhoea; allergic reactions (rash, fever); tinnitus; bronchospasm; and fluid retention.</P>
<P>The original review summarising three trials found preliminary evidence to suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may prevent pulmonary deterioration in people with mild lung disease due to CF, but that their routine use could not be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 1999</LINK>).

<P>The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with NSAIDs in preventing pulmonary deterioration and maintaining an optimal level of pulmonary function among those with CF. Specifically, we wished to examine the hypotheses that treatment with NSAIDs for a period of two months or more:</P>
<OL>
<LI>improves or prevents deterioration in objective measures of lung function;</LI>
<LI>reduces the need for intravenous antibiotic therapy for respiratory exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>reduces the need for hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>reduces the number of days spent in hospital for respiratory exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>improves quality of life;</LI>
<LI>improves survival;</LI>
<LI>is associated with adverse effects (including major haemorrhage such as a life threatening gastrointestinal bleed or haemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal upset including dyspepsia or nausea, diarrhoea, allergic reactions (rash, fever), tinnitus, bronchospasm or fluid retention).</LI>

<P>At the time of the initial review two authors (CD and AC) independently applied inclusion criteria to all potential reports.

<P>The authors independently extracted data using a standard data extraction form.</P>
<P>In order to directly compare pulmonary function outcomes in the pediatric population as defined in the Konstan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>), data from the Trans-Canadian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>) were re-analyzed by stratifying the data at 13 years of age.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:06:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In order to establish a risk of bias for each included study, the authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. The authors recorded details of the following: concealment and generation of the randomisation sequence; whether the trial was blinded; whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible from the available data; and whether the report documented the number of participants lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the trial. </P>
<P>If the generation and concealment of allocation were judged to be adequate, this corresponded to a low risk of bias; if they were judged to be inadequate, this corresponded to a high risk of bias and if they were judged to be unclear, the risk of bias too was judged to be unclear. </P>
<P>For blinding, the risk of bias decreased if more people (participants, clinicians or outcome assessors) were blinded to the intervention. The risk of bias was unclear if the studies did not describe the degree of blinding used. </P>
<P>Regarding incomplete outcome data, there was a risk of bias if a number of participants withdrew or were lost to follow up with no good reason supplied or if the reasons differed across groups. The risk of bias was low if the amount of missing data was approximately equal and balanced across groups. If the numbers randomized into each intervention group are not clearly reported, the risk of bias from missing data was judged to be unclear.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-06-23 16:28:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We proposed a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome measure across trials, specifically the odds of an outcome among treatment-allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls. We considered improvement in any of those outcomes that demonstrated efficacy of treatment to be beneficial.</P>

<P>The original review in 1999 identified five trials, of which three, reporting data from a total of 145 participants met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).

At the time of the original review, the remaining trial (a large Canadian trial comparing ibuprofen to placebo in children aged 6 to 18 years) had completed recruitment but results were not available. This trial, including a total of 142 children followed for a period of two years, has since been published and was included in this review in 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The participants included in the four eligible trials ranged from 5 to 39 years of age. In two separate trials from the same center, eligibility was defined according to an objective measure of lung function (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the first trial, participants with mild to moderate lung disease were included, defined as those in whom FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was more than 30% of that predicted for age, sex and height (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In addition, only those judged to be clinically stable, without a history of adverse effects with NSAIDs, and not taking 'interfering medication' were included. In the second trial, only those participants in whom FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was more than 60% predicted were included (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Additional criteria were employed in this trial, namely that participants had not received intravenous antibiotics in the preceding two months; inhaled sodium cromoglycate in the preceding six months; or inhaled or systemic corticosteroids in the preceding two years. Individuals were also excluded if they were known to: be hypersensitive to NSAIDs; have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; have a respiratory isolate of <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>; or have hepatic, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, haematological or peptic ulcer disease.</P>
<P>In the third trial by Sordelli, eligibility was defined by a combination of microbiological, anthropometric and clinical features; namely, previous sputum culture positive for <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, a Schwachman score less than 50, body weight greater than 15 kg, an ability to swallow medication and an ability to comply with pulmonary function tests (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Canadian multicenter trial recruited children with a sweat chloride diagnosis of CF and an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> greater than 60% predicted at time of entry into the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Children were excluded if they had been hospitalized in the two months prior to entry, or if they had taken corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for more than one month in the past year, had abnormal hepatic, renal, hematologic disorders or coagulopathy, documented evidence of peptic ulcer disease (endoscopy) or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or a history of hypersensitivity reactions to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three of the trials examined ibuprofen compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>), while a fourth reported the use of piroxicam (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). In the first Konstan trial reporting ibuprofen, children were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled three-month dose escalation trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). This trial examined the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen, to identify the optimal dose and to evaluate adverse effects of ibuprofen treatment in children treated over a three-month treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). This first trial contributed to the design of the second trial from this center, which examined the long-term use of ibuprofen given over a four-year period (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The most recent trial from Canada is the biggest trial of NSAIDs in a CF population, following 142 children aged 6 to 18 years over a period of two years (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the trial of piroxicam, participants were assigned to piroxicam for a period of between 12 and 19 months (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In each trial the NSAID was compared with placebo. In the first Konstan trial, 13 children were randomized to receive ibuprofen and five to receive placebo, both of which were given for between one and three months (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). The dose of ibuprofen was 300 mg twice daily in the first month, increasing to 400 mg in the second month and 600 mg in the third month, if peak plasma concentrations of ibuprofen were less than 50 µg/mL (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the second Konstan trial, 42 participants were randomized to ibuprofen and 43 to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). All participants underwent a baseline pharmacokinetics trial employing 20 mg tablets at a dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg to a maximum of 1600 mg. The number of assigned pills was adjusted to provide a peak plasma concentration of 50 to 100 µg/mL. The participants took the prescribed dose twice daily and were followed for four years. This dose was revised if body weight increased by more than 25% during the trial and was reviewed in all participants during the third year to take account of increased body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the double-blind Canadian trial, participants were allocated treatment by a centralized pharmacy, using a predefined block randomization schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Like Konstan's second ibuprofen trial, all participants underwent a baseline pharmacokinetics trial employing 200 mg tablets at a dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg to a maximum of 1600 mg. The number of assigned pills was adjusted to provide a peak plasma concentration of 50 to 100 &#956;g/mL for each participant in the trial. The participants took the prescribed dose twice daily and were followed bi-annually for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the piroxicam trial, a single morning dose of between 5 to 20 mg, determined by participant's body weight, was given (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Of the outcomes specified in the prior hypotheses of the review FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> were reported in all four trials comparing an NSAID to placebo. However, the specific summary measures employed and the interval between starting treatment and assessing lung function varied between the four trials. In the first Konstan trial, FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>was summarized as group mean (standard deviation (SD)) of per cent predicted at entry to the trial and after an interval of two months (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the second Konstan trial, the primary outcome measure was the annual rate of change in per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> over the four-year period of treatment, with annual rate of change in per cent predicted FVC, FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> and body weight as secondary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The Canadian trial reported the difference in mean annual rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted, FVC % predicted and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Secondary outcomes included: chest radiography, nutritional status (body mass index (BMI), weight z score), overall hospitalization rates as well as specific hospitalization rates for respiratory and gastrointestinal admissions. In the piroxicam trial, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB>% were presented graphically as group means and standard errors of the absolute values, assessed at approximately four-monthly intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Participants were then categorized according to whether their respiratory function status was 'worse' or 'not worse' (the latter as determined by a more than 10% improvement in one or more of the respiratory function parameters).</P>
<P>Chest X-ray (Brasfield) scores were reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). In two trials these were summarized as the number showing improvement or deterioration (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>), rather than a specific score as in the piroxicam trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Change in weight was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Konstan reported per cent ideal body weight and its change over four years (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Although weight gain was evaluated in the piroxicam trial, this was grouped into a clinical status summary; and summaries of weight change were not provided (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). The Canadian trial reported nutritional status as weight and BMI z scores (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antibiotic use was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>), but the data were summarized differently: as average days oral antibiotic treatment per participant per year in the piroxicam trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>); and as change in the percentage using oral, inhaled or intravenous antibiotics over the period of the Konstan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The trans-Canada trial reported use of oral or inhaled antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality of life measures were not reported in any of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the adverse outcomes specified, abdominal pain was reported in four trials; epistaxis (nose bleeds) in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>); conjunctivitis in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>) occult blood, decrease in stool frequency in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>); nausea, diarrhoea, gastritis, epigastric pain, reflux esophagitis, hepatitis, vomiting tinnitus, reactive arthritis, elevated liver enzymes and gastro-intestinal bleeds in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). None of the trials reported haemorrhagic stroke, dyspepsia, rash, fever, bronchospasm or fluid retention.</P>

<P>The method used to generate the random sequence and the concealment of allocation were assigned to one of three categories: adequate; unclear; or inadequate; these corresponded to a low, unclear or high risk of bias respectively.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generation of sequence</HEADING>
<P>The method used to generate the random sequence was adequate in all three ibuprofen trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the earlier Konstan trial, randomisation was based upon a computer-generated randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the later Konstan trial, randomisation was carried out with permuted blocks of four participants each stratified by age (under 13 years, 13 to 18 years and 19 years or over) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the Lands trial, participants were allocated using a predefined block-randomisation schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). This corresponded to a low risk of bias for generation of the randomisation sequence in each of these trials.</P>
<P>In the piroxicam trial, while the process was described as random in the paper, the randomisation method was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). This led to the risk of bias for generation of sequence being judged to be unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Concealment of allocation</HEADING>
<P>Concealment of allocation was adequate in all three ibuprofen trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the earlier Konstan trial, the randomisation sequence was provided by the pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the later Konstan trial, only the pharmacologist and pharmacist were privy to the allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the Canadian trial, a central pharmacy coded and shipped the tablets to the participating centers; the code was broken by the central pharmacy only on request from the Safety and Monitoring Committee (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). This corresponds to a low risk of bias in these trials due to the concealment of allocation.</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation was not discussed and the risk of bias is therefore unclear in the piroxicam trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Reporting of double blinding was recorded as either present or absent.</P>
<P>Four trials were described as double blinded. In the earlier Konstan trial the pharmaceutical company provided the clinics with identical-appearing placebo tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the later Konstan trial, the placebo tablets were again identical in appearance to the ibuprofen tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Lands states that participants, care-givers and study personnel were all blinded to treatment assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Sordelli describes the placebo tablets as being "indistinguishable" from the piroxicam tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Therefore we judged the risk of bias from blinding to be low in four of the five included trials.</P>

<P>The reported 'intention-to-treat' analysis was defined as complete; or analysed with less than 15% of participants excluded; or analysed with more than 15% of participants excluded.</P>
<P>In two of the ibuprofen trials, analysis was based on intention-to-treat (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>), while in the other there were less than 15% of participants excluded (three participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). These three withdrawals were due to poor venous access, behavioural problems and difficulty in transport to follow up trial visits. We therefore judged the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data to be low in these three trials.</P>
<P>More than 15% of participants were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 8) (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Four participants from the treatment group and four from the control group did not complete the study. Reasons for exclusion included abdominal pain, hematemesis, hepatic dysfunction and acute respiratory exacerbation. Risk of bias was also low as withdrawals described and were equal across groups.</P>

<P>In two studies we did not identify any selective reporting as all the listed outcomes measured were reported in the results section of the paper (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Thus we judged these trials to be at a low risk of bias from selective reporting. It should be noted that in Konstan's ibuprofen trials, the trial investigators monitored a large number of potential adverse effects of ibuprofen but reporting was confined to those considered to be most important and findings which were not statistically significant were not reported; we therefore judge there to be a high risk of bias from selective reporting in these two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Objective measures of lung function</HEADING>
<P>In the second Konstan trial and the Canadian trial measures of lung function were summarized as the within-participant annual rates of change over the trial period (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the Konstan trial differences in rates of change for FVC, FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>and FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> included age as a covariate (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Like the Konstan trial, the Canadian trial used mixed-model analysis adjusting for the correlated nature of the repeated measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). It is important to note that participants in the Konstan trial ranged in age from 5 to 39 years (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>), whereas those in the Trans Canadian trial ranged from 6 to18 years (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). The other ibuprofen trial only measured FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, but did not report data we could enter into the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the piroxicam trial, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> were summarised as the group mean and standard errors at each of five visits during the study period and therefore could not be directly compared to the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Participants completing the study were also classified according to whether their respiratory function was 'not worse' (defined as 10% increase in baseline absolute value of one or more of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC or FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>) or 'worse' (less than 10% increase).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">a. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)</HEADING>
<P>We were able to combine data from two ibuprofen trials in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Overall, the meta-analysis results show a statistically significant positive influence of high-dose ibuprofen on the rate of change of per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.21 to 2.42) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). When the trials were considered individually, the second Konstan trial found participants treated with ibuprofen experienced a slower annualized rate of decline in per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> compared to the placebo group, MD 1.43% (95% CI -0.12 to 2.98), but this was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The annual rate of change per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the Canadian trial was also not significantly different between the two treatment groups, but demonstrated a slower decline in the ibuprofen group, MD 1.20% (95% CI -0.38 to 2.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the first ibuprofen trial, there were no data reported which could be included in the meta-analysis, but the authors reported no significant change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> among those completing treatment over a two-month period with either ibuprofen or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, the post-hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline of per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the ibuprofen group in younger children, MD 1.41% (95% CI 0.03 to 2.80), compared with a non-significant difference in children aged 13 years and over, MD of 0.75 (95% CI -1.02 to 2.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In the second Konstan trial the effect of ibuprofen was stronger amongst those starting treatment with ibuprofen before the age of 13 years, MD 2.71% (95% CI 0.60 to 4.82), compared to those aged 13 years and over at start of treatment, MD -0.36% (95% CI -2.49 to 1.77) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the Canadian trial the difference between the treatment and control groups was not significant in younger children, MD 0.42% (95% CI -1.42 to 2.26), but was statistically significant in the older children, MD 3.20% (95% CI 0.04 to 6.36) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">b. Forced vital capacity (FVC)</HEADING>
<P>Again, data from two trials could be combined in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Overall there was a significant difference in annual rate of change per cent predicted FVC in favour of NSAIDs, MD 1.27% (95% CI 0.26 to 2.28) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Individually, in the second Konstan trial the mean annual decline favoured the ibuprofen group versus the placebo group, but the result was not significant, MD 0.99% (95% CI -0.43 to 2.41) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The Canadian trial found a significant difference in the annual rate of change of per cent predicted FVC in favour of the ibuprofen group, MD 1.55% (95% CI 0.12 to 2.98) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>As with the FEV<SUB>1</SUB> data, we compared different age groups in a post-hoc change to our outcomes. Among participants enrolled before the age of 13, there was stronger evidence in support of ibuprofen for slowing the rate of decline of pre cent predicted FVC, MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.04 to 2.60), compared with the rate of decline in participants aged 13 years or older, MD of 0.78% (95% CI -0.71 to 2.27). In the under-13 age group, Konstan showed a significant difference in favour of ibuprofen, MD 2.03% (95% CI 0.10 to 3.96), but the results from Lands were non-significant, MD 0.76% (95% CI -0.95 to 2.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Conversely, in the over-13 age group, Konstan showed a non-significant result, MD -0.47% (95% CI -2.27 to 1.33), but Lands demonstrated a significant result in favour of ibuprofen, MD 3.48% (95% CI 0.83 to 6.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">c. Forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>)</HEADING>
<P>Similar trends were observed for the annual rate of decline for per cent predicted FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>); the overall result from both trials for all age groups combined was in favour of ibuprofen, MD 1.80% (95% CI 0.16 to 3.44), although both trials individually showed non-significant results; MD 1.92% (95% CI -0.10 to 3.94) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>) and MD 1.56% (95% CI -1.28 to 4.40) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the post-hoc analysis stratified by age, the overall difference between the groups was non-significant in both age groups; for under 13 years at randomisation, MD 2.03% (95% CI -0.09 to 4.16) and for 13 years and over, MD 1.28% (95% CI -1.22 to 3.79) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Within these groups, Konstan showed a significant difference in the under 13 age group, MD 2.90% (95% CI 0.20 to 5.60), but Lands showed a non-significant result, MD 0.62% (95% CI -2.83 to 4.07); and both trials showed non-significant results for the older subgroup, MD 0.49% (95% CI -2.35 to 3.33) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>) and MD 4.03% (95% CI -1.26 to9.32) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>Intravenous antibiotic usage was reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In this trial, a higher percentage of participants in the ibuprofen arm had received intravenous antibiotics in the 12 months preceding randomisation compared with the placebo group (27% versus 14% respectively). In the final 12 months (Year Four) of the trial, this percentage was similar in the ibuprofen arm (29%), but markedly increased in the placebo arm (37%). Within the trial report, changes in the frequency of concomitant therapy with intravenous antibiotics were compared using categorical-data modelling, a method which cannot be replicated here without access to individual patient data. Thus a data table was not compared for this outcome, although from this one trial long-term use of high dose ibuprofen appears to be associated with less use of intravenous antibiotic usage over a 12-month period. Inhaled antibiotic use was not recorded in the Canadian Trial, and no differences were observed in the concomitant use of inhaled and oral antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). Participants treated with piroxicam did not require more antibiotics than those treated with placebo in the Sordelli trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Antibiotic use was not reported in the first Konstan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Number of hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations were only reported in the Canadian trial: 26% (placebo) versus 20% (ibuprofen); however, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant Peto OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.65) (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>The percentage of participants requiring at least one hospital admission for any reason during the trial period were reported for all four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). In the first Konstan trial, one participant in the placebo group was hospitalised (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>). In the second ibuprofen trial by Konstan, 21 participants (51%) in the ibuprofen arm were hospitalised during the course of the trial, compared with 26 (60%) in the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the Canadian trial admission rates were lower in the ibuprofen group 18 (27%) versus the placebo group 25 (36%), but the difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the piroxicam trial, seven participants (35%) in the piroxicam arm were admitted to hospital compared with 11 (52%) in the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). Combining these results in the analysis, overall there was no significant difference in the number of admissions in the ibuprofen group compared to the placebo group, Peto OR 0.64 (95 % CI 0.39 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). However, the studies were heterogeneous with respect to type of NSAIDs assessed, criteria for inclusion, treatment duration (and hence period at risk for hospital admission), as well as methodological quality. Data were not reported by age group.</P>
<P>This analysis does not take into account the number of admissions per participant or the duration of each admission. These data were presented in three trials but in a different format in each, so that the information provided could not be combined (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). In one ibuprofen trial, the mean number of hospital days per participant and mean number of admissions per hospital patient were summarised by treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Both were lower in the ibuprofen compared with the control group, but were statistically non-significant, Peto OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.25) (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). In the piroxicam trial, median duration of admission was reported to be greater among the control group compared with the intervention group (18 days versus one day respectively). However, this analysis did not take account of individual variation in number and duration of admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Number of days admitted to hospital for respiratory exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Similarly the number of days spent in hospital for respiratory exacerbations was not reported separately within any trial. Although the number of days spent in hospital for any reason was reported in all four trials, data could not be combined due to the differing summary measures used. In the second Konstan trial, there was no difference reported in number of hospitalisations or days spent in hospital between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). This did not change when divided into subgroups by age. The Canadian trial reported the absolute number of hospital days in each group 561 (placebo) versus 248 (ibuprofen), as well as the hospitalization rate adjusted for overdisposition; 4.1 days per year (placebo) compared to 1.8 days per year (ibuprofen). Post-hoc analysis of hospitalization data split by age revealed a significant age trend with older participants having more hospital admissions than younger participants (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). In the Sordelli trial, the number of hospital days per patient days at risk was based on a completed treatment analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). The placebo-treated group required 301 hospital days of a possible 8609 patient days at risk, while the piroxicam group had 192 of 7920 risk days hospitalised (42% decrease), including one participant admitted four times for a total of 90 days.</P>

<P>Although not explicitly reported in the ibuprofen trials, the principal author of two of the trials has confirmed that no death occurred and that all participants were accounted for in these two trials (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1999</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Nutritional status</HEADING>
<P>Only the second ibuprofen trial reported change in percentage ideal body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Ideal body weight was determined on the basis of age, sex and height. Body weight as a percentage of ideal declined among those treated with placebo, whereas those treated with ibuprofen showed no or very little decline, OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.81) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). This effect was most marked among those aged less than 13 years; for each year the percentage ideal body weight declined by 1.45% (95% CI 0.33, 2.57) more among control children compared to those treated with ibuprofen (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

Overall, in all three ibuprofen trials, a greater proportion in both treatment groups reported a decrease in abdominal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>); while more participants in the piroxicam trial reported an increase in abdominal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Sordelli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sordelli 1994</LINK>). We were able to combine data from two trials looking at the increase in abdominal pain and the analysis showed a non-significant result in favour of ibuprofen, Peto OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:12:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is increasing biological and scientific evidence to suggest that inflammation is a major contributor to declining lung function in people with CF. The effectiveness of long-term treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDs in preventing this decline is therefore of major clinical relevance. Given that measures of lung function, particularly FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, are the most significant prognostic factors, changes in the rate of decline will have the most significant impact on prognosis. This systematic review and accompanying meta-analyses are primarily based on two trials of ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>) which contribute the majority of data and allow for meaningful analysis of the rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and other spirometric indices. </P>
<P>Based on data from 226 participants from these two trials, there is moderate evidence to support the use of ibuprofen twice daily for slowing the progression of CF lung disease. The use of ibuprofen can slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with mild CF lung disease. The additional results do not allow for further comment on an effect on nutritional status, other than what is reported in the Konstan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). Overall there were fewer hospitalisations and improved chest x-ray scores in the ibuprofen group, but the results were not significant. The rate of change of percentage of ideal body weight was greatest in the under 13 year group receiving NSAIDs, and for the cohort as a whole. Unfortunately, these trials are too small and follow up is too short to determine whether treatment with NSAIDs increases survival. Nonetheless, pulmonary function as assessed by FEV<SUB>1</SUB> is the primary predictor of survival in CF and it is therefore reasonable to assume that maintenance of pulmonary function is an important therapeutic goal in CF.</P>
<P>The trials reporting treatment with ibuprofen employed a high dose, designed to achieve mean peak plasma concentrations of greater than 50 µg/mL, which have been associated with maximal anti-inflammatory effect. A potentially narrow therapeutic window for ibuprofen may exist as experimental work in animals and humans suggests that low plasma concentrations may be associated with a paradoxical increase in inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 2003</LINK>). Careful pharmacological monitoring was employed in the ibuprofen trials to maintain peak plasma concentrations in the desired range. Further studies are required to determine whether other NSAIDs are associated with this biphasic response.</P>
<P>One additional point concerning ibuprofen is the need to repeat pharmacokinetic analyses. The current programs using ibuprofen suggest repeating these assays at least every two years but more frequent follow-up is necessary if there is a weight change of more than 25%. It is suggested that hematologic, renal, and hepatic status are monitored annually.</P>
<P>Monitoring the effects of therapeutic treatment relies on appropriate detection of important clinical changes in lung function. Since a biological marker for identifying lung function changes has yet to be identified, follow-up studies require recruitment of a sufficiently large sample, followed repeatedly over a period deemed adequate to detect important clinical changes which are a direct result of the therapeutic intervention.</P>
<P>Conventional therapy for CF is an evolving practice that requires constant evaluation of new treatments and therapies. To date, the study of NSAIDs to slow down the progression of lung deterioration has relied solely on the comparison of a placebo group on a background of other accepted therapies. To our knowledge, there have been no comparisons between different anti-inflammatory therapies or other medications, such as azithromycin, which may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since NSAIDs are considered a safe medication in children, they have become increasingly available as an over-the-counter preparation to young children; however, there is little known about the effects of using high doses for a prolonged period of time. Confirming previous studies, the additional information provided by the most recent Canadian trial suggests that high-dose ibuprofen did not result in an increase in abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Lands-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lands 2007</LINK>). The most recent trial did, however, report one case of significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage which led to the introduction of routine prophylactic prescription of H2-blockers or proton ion pump inhibitors to protect intestinal mucosa. The effectiveness of this protective strategy has not been documented. Furthermore, four cases of transient renal failure among children being treated concurrently with ibuprofen and intravenous aminoglycosides have been reported, emphasising the importance of adequately assessing adverse effects in the context of other drug therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Kovesi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovesi 1998</LINK>). More recently, Bertenshaw et al have retrospectively shown acute renal failure among individuals who were treated concurrently with aminoglycosides and NSAIDs (<LINK REF="REF-Bertenshaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertenshaw 2007</LINK>), which provides further evidence of an interaction between NSAIDs and intravenous aminoglycosides that may have important clinical implications. Given this evidence, the use of NSAIDs should be temporarily discontinued during intravenous administration of aminoglycosides and possibly colymycin (colistin) (<LINK REF="REF-Bertenshaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertenshaw 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, individuals with esophagitis or peptic ulcer disease should not use high-dose ibuprofen. Individuals with recurrent significant hemoptysis should also not be placed on this treatment.</P>
<P>A recent review of people on the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry was undertaken to evaluate the effect of high-dose ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 2007</LINK>). Data was evaluated from individuals with an initial age of 6 to 17 years and an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> below 60% predicted; the period covered was 1996 to 2002. There was a significant reduction in the rate of decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the high-dose ibuprofen group 0.48%,  (95% CI 0.19 to 0.78). This translated to an absolute 2.5% smaller decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> over five years. Adjusting for the use of inhaled tobramycin or dornase alfa (typically used in people who are more ill) strengthened the effect. However, adjusting for individuals who discontinued the ibuprofen did not appear to affect the results, even though these tended to be those with more advanced disease. There was an increase in the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleed with high-dose ibuprofen. However, the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer or renal failure was not increased.  </P>
<P>The mechanisms for the beneficial effects of high-dose ibuprofen have not been clearly elucidated. Commonly the effects have been attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of ibuprofen. However, a recent cellular study, using clinically relevant doses, suggests that ibuprofen may exert some of its effect through the activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2008</LINK>).  </P>
<P>An important consideration is that the existing trials have recruited participants from across a wide age span, and have included young children as well as adults with CF. The results of this review suggest that the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory treatment with NSAIDs may be greatest among young children with mild disease, in whom fixed structural damage to the lungs has not yet occurred. The second Konstan trial used the age of 13 years as an arbitrary cut off point and found similar results with different age cut off points (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1995</LINK>). The effects of NSAID treatment in children aged less than five years has not been reported. Further trials examining the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of NSAIDs and other anti-inflammatory therapies are required in young symptomatic children as well as very young pre-symptomatic children.</P>
<P>The current management of CF requires those affected and their families to devote a significant effort to complying with physiotherapy, and oral, inhaled or intravenous medication. The extent to which treatment with oral NSAIDs may reduce the need for concomitant treatment or hospital admission is of interest, since this may improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs for the individual and the health service. Evidence from this review suggests that there may be important reductions in days spent in hospital for all causes, but these findings require confirmation in other studies, which ideally should identify hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations separately. Although there are methodological problems in measuring quality of life for very young children, it is feasible to measure quality of life in older children and in their parents or carers. Future trials should begin to assess these outcomes as, given the current median survival for CF, quality of life assumes greater relevance.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review suggest that high-dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in children with CF. There may also be a beneficial effect on the number of days spent in hospital and ibuprofen appears to be relatively well-tolerated. However, the long-term effects of prolonged use of high doses of NSAIDs have yet to be determined. Furthermore, gastrointestinal protection is required as are regular pharmacokinetic trials and safety profiles. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapies can be beneficial for slowing down the rate of lung function decline in people with CF. Further work is required to understand the mechanism of action so that therapies with enhanced safety profiles can be developed. Future trials need to address the age at which such therapies are most effective. While pulmonary function and nutritional status are the primary outcomes of interest, evidence for a reduction in concomitant therapy, specifically intravenous antibiotic use, as well as in hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations, should be sought, as these secondary outcome measures may have important implications for cost-effectiveness of treatment as well as quality of life. All trials should be designed to be of adequate power to reliably identify important adverse events such as, for example, major gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Multicenter trials will add to the validity of findings by enhancing their generalisability. </P>
<P>The clinical variability of CF suggests that it may be helpful for future updates of this systematic review to be based on individual patient data rather than on the published trial reports, as this will allow appropriate meta-analysis of within-participant changes from baseline.</P>
