Mortality remains moderate as the upper end of the CI is very close to 1.00.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;plain language: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;However, as the majority of included studies are industry-sponsored, they are extremely likely to have followed gold standards for both random sequence generation and concealment of allocation and therefore be at low risk of bias.&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;. (LJN)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CJC this is ready for peer review. I have made one minor change to the SoF to downgrade the hospitalisations to low grade and altered the discussion as there was an incorrect assertion that there was no significant difference in people with one or more exacerbations. July 18th&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note from Steve to Emma and Chris 12 /07/2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The validation report indicates there is a problem with the Yang 2012 reference (seems to be particularly in relation to the Art No). Liz and I have looked at it together and in our opinion its fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering whether the PLS does need editing down to 400 words - taking decision that we'll try to leave it as is unless we hear from you and then we'll edit further&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma W notes 25/06/2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for submitting your review update. There is a bit of a way to go in terms of tidying the review up. In several places there are spaces missing between sentences, some parenthesis around references are amiss and there are some errant capitalisation e.g. Primary Outcomes in the title of the forest plots. Some of these I have changed in tracked changes, but would appreciate it if you could spend some time to look at this too. Make sure to carefully go through the review with respect to each of the points below as they do not represent exhaustive notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review update was tagged with 'conclusions not changed'. Is this the case? With approximately 5000 new participants, the conclusions may well have been strengthened and I invite you to consider this before you resubmit the review. The sentence &amp;quot;The major new finding of our review was the significant reduction in mortality &amp;quot; implies that the conclusions have changed as I assume this relates to the update. If it doesn't relate to the update, you will need to rephrase as it's hardly a new finding if it related to a previous version of the review.- Sorted. Becky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt; - the objectives here should match those in the review exactly. Please amend Have done this. Using those in main body of review. Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plain language summary - &lt;/b&gt;please look at the PLEACS standards and re-write&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/mecir - I have done this. Becky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;not sure you need the &amp;quot;, or placebo,&amp;quot; highlighted? I think you meant to talk about the possible synergistic effects and not the benefit of the drugs over placebo? - yes, I think that is correct. I have deleted 'or placebo'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a reference missing - Luis to fix. Fixed. Luis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;contributions of authors - add initials to say who did what (and throughout methods section) - done. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;selection of studies - describe the steps you did more carefully - done by Steve,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit of analysis - it was the individual patient rather than the trial. please amend I have done this Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the discussion of pooling does not belong in the methods. I don't think you should be making choices about how you analysed data based on other reviews - it should be done on whether it is appropriate to pool. I am confused because you can see that some of these data have been pooled - did you mean that you subgrouped according to which inhaler was used and did not pool the different inhaler types? - fixed by Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sensitivity analyses - your threshold of 20% heterogeneity does not seem to make sense with your new definition of thresholds can you rationalise.- I will discuss with Chris (Becky)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search :&amp;quot;A previous ongoing study, Morgan 2004, has not been identified by the most recent search and is therefore not included in this update.&amp;quot; - not sure that sentence is written quite right - it's not the fact that it was not identified by the search that justifies the exclusion, but the fact that it is not possible to locate a trial report? - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;A total of 10,400 participants were randomised to studies in the review.&amp;quot; - no they weren't! Participants were randomised to interventions within studies. suggest change to 'included in this review' Have fixed this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Lung function, if reported, was measured as FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or PEF in all the studies&amp;quot; this doesn't seem to be consistent - not sure you can say if reported and then refer to all the studies. amend - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need to link the analyses where you refer to them (click on the 'insert link' button to do just that) Have fixed this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pneumonia mentions a significant amount of heterogeneity - but in the methods you say that 30-60 may represent a moderate amount of heterogeneity - be consistent with the language Have fixed this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sentence garbled - table 4 doesn't exist: &amp;quot;The majority of the weight for this combined result again comes from the TORCH trial.Table 4, which tested the FPS inhaler.&amp;quot; - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I condensed the SGRQ/CDRQ under QoL to remove some of the headings and simplify it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lung function - there was a heading which seems unnecessary to include and I deleted it - but do make sure you are absolutely clear whether each reported outcome was pre- or post- dose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not have time to check this afternoon, but can you make sure that you have not reported only the significant adverse events as this may represent a source of reporting bias. I have checked this - we have reported nonsignificant as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure how helpful the following sentence is - can't tell from it which were clinically relevant. &amp;quot;In some cases the benefits reached the accepted levels of clinical significance, but only just.&amp;quot; - we will discuss with Chris&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The risk of bias in blinding, attrition and selective reporting varied among the trials.&amp;quot; did you think that any of these risks posed a threat to the conclusions of the review or the interpretation of the results? Your GRADEing decisions should be reflected here - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;In addition, we have 'pruned' a few outcomes especially from FPS, to aid clarity and to prevent the reader being overwhelmed.&amp;quot; pruned is a bit colloquial - can you say what outcomes were deleted instead- re-worded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Our review supports a stepwise approach, and not necessarily a move straight from placebo to combined inhalers.&amp;quot; are placebo inhalers prescribed in general practice? rephrase! - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;If symptoms are the main problem, but not exacerbations, then consider LABA or LAMA first.&amp;quot; this seems to be a recommendation and beyond the scope of the review - fixed. Becky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;It would now be difficult for ethics committee to approve a trial design with a placebo arm in a severe COPD population&amp;quot;. - would you suggest that we now stabilise this review and not update it again? - Will discuss with Chris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data and analyses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;v - should be versus (see Cochrane style guide) As far as I can see this is now OK Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;some outcomes (mortality at least) are divided according to whether they were reported as a primary or secondary outcome in the trial - this was not a pre-specified subgroup analysis. Please dismantle subgroups - done. Becky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delete subgroups without data I have fixed this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;replace &amp;lt;/= (and other symbols) with the correct symbol - you can select the symbol by clicking the omega button and then do a find and replace I have been all through and think I have managed to fix every example of this Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;abbreviations should be defined at first mention - e.g. FEV1 in the background I will do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be consistent - use ICS throughout and don't switch between ICS and corticosteroids I will do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BUDF crept in as an acronym - but you had chosen BDF. Can you please carefully check all acronyms are consistent and correct As far as I can see we are now OK with this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings tables &lt;/b&gt;- see notes in table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yang 2007 has been updated - please replace with the new reference and check and amend any statements supported by this review. Can you also please check if any of the other Cochrane reviews you reference have been updated in the same way. I have fixed this. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;see also Emma J's notes on references below I have fixed this - Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;inconsistent use of tags for published/unpublished data - please amend I will ask Steve about this,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma J notes re: refs 20.6.13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCO30005 listed x2? I have fixed this - Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCO30003 listed x2? (highlighted) I have fixed this - Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindberg 2006/Lindenberg 2006? I have fixed this - Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should GINA 2010 be updated to GINA 2012? I have fixed this - Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also please can you add 'dates accessed' for those I've highlighted. TVM! Becky - please could you ring me about this. Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 8 2013 CJC added methods and references for calculation of NNTs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not finish background Luis J N OCt 01-2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC editing following Peer Review Aug 1st&lt;br&gt;Abstract updated in red to reflect the class effects of combined inhalers as suggested by peer reviewer, also change in rate of exacerbation clarified and TORCH nnt added. Pneumonia also added as a primary outcome for both combined inhalers in forest plots. I have toned down the health status conclusion as one Peer Reviewer pointed out that either the changes are clinically significant or not (see results). **Toby please check you are happy with this and adjust if necessary**&lt;br&gt;TJL: FINE - I HAVE ALSO TWEAKED THE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY TO INCLUDE INFO REGARDING MORTALITY. CAN YOU CHECK THIS?&lt;br&gt;Background &amp;quot;The combination of these two drugs in daily practice, at GOLD stages IIB and III (or grades III and IV in the 2003 updated stages) of severity (GOLD 2006), patients typically seek medical attention because of dyspnoea or an exacerbation of their disease that has an impact on their quality of life.&amp;quot; I agree this sentence does not make sense and have removed it from para 2.&lt;br&gt;Clarification that good current evidence is available in ASTHMA.&lt;br&gt;***Toby could you sort out figure 2 to include exacerbations in the title and remove TRISTAN not TORCH for the sensitivity analysis? Please could you also clarify if the changes in SGRQ and other health measures are end of study or annualised? also did you look at funnel plots?******&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: END OF STUDY, HAVE ADDED THIS. I LOOKED AT FUNNEL PLOTS FOR MORTALITY AND PNEUMONIA - THEY LOOK PRETTY FUNNEL SHAPED TO ME! ELSEWHERE THEY ARE UNLIKLEY TO BE OF HELP WITH SO FEW STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR QOL (NB THIS IS BECAUSE ONLY TWO SYMBICORT STUDIES ARE AVAILABLE AND WE DID NOT POOL SERETIDE AND SYMBICORT FOR THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies: TORCH did not require previous exacerbations -add to patient details in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: in view of a 3 yr NNT of 36 I have removed SMALL from the effect description on mortality (questioned by one reviewer). I have also moved pneumonia up to be a primary outcome. (Post Hoc!). I have also added a pooled pneumonia result (as there is no heterogeneity) and used this for the 3 yr NNT. Point estimate unchanged but I have added Calverley 2003 to the NNT(H) table as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have modified the final para of the discussion and simplified it (in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a really important update for the next submission.&lt;br&gt;Next action: Toby to respond to *** above and please thank the peer reviewers for their input. Then this should be ready for the submission deadline.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC revisions Jun 26th&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Abbreviations removed. Emphasis changed from separate inhaler issues to doses of ICS for future research. Results expanded to draw out FPS and BDF results separately.&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Comparison with separate inhalers taken out (I think this is distracting and there is no data anyway).&lt;br&gt;Included studies&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;No studies have been undertaken which compare combination with concomitant administration of ICS and LABA in COPD.&amp;quot; Cut in view of the removal of this comparison.&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;I think we need to add N to the main results (done) and add them to the text as figures? ****Toby can you add figures please?****&lt;br&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Primary outcomes added to Metaview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FPS led to significantly greater differences compared with SAL in Mahler 2002: 0.9, P &amp;lt; 0.001, but no comparison between FPS and SAL was made in Hanania 2003. Mahler 2002 reported a significant difference when FPS was compared with FP alone (1.3, P = 0.033). No comparison was made with FP in Hanania 2003.&amp;quot; Passages comparing to other arms removed in various places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added TORCH 3 year NNT results to the text. I have also added the pooled primary outcome results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pneumonia data has been added for Calverley. The implications have also been tweaked a bit to emphasise doses of ICS as well as separate inhalers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****Toby please add Ernst 2007 reference and link into the discussion.****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;br&gt;=========================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit June 2007&lt;br&gt;CJC review on Archie&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;Abstract not clear where individual arm comparisons fit in this. No longer in this review so needs to come out of abstract.&lt;br&gt;Abstract conclusion might draw out the Fluticasone uncertainty rather than the separate inhalers issue? In fact should the one versus two inhalers be another review? What about different dose of ICS in combined inhalers as well?&lt;br&gt;TORCH has been included. Adjustment for interim analysis not relevant to Meta-analysis?&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;Surely Mortality should be a primary outcome?&lt;br&gt;Was Tiotropium allowed as a co-intervention?&lt;br&gt;Since Dal Negro and Hanania used 250 FP instead of 500 FP twice daily this should be looked at in relation to pneumonia etc&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;I need to see how the subgroup dichotomy applies to the papers. Salbutamol 400?&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;Well laid out. Para below does not belong to this review!&lt;br&gt;Symptom score&lt;br&gt;FPS combination versus placebo&lt;br&gt;FPS led to improved symptom scores (transitional dysponea index) when compared with placebo (MD 1.04 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.53) Mahler 2002 and Hanania 2003 gave a significant difference in change scores in favour FPS . FPS led to significantly greater differences compared with SAL in Mahler 2002: 0.9, P &amp;lt; 0.001, but no comparison between FPS and SAL was made in Hanania 2003. Mahler 2002 reported a significant difference when FPS was compared with FP alone (1.3, P = 0.033). No comparison was made with FP in Hanania 2003.&lt;br&gt;How we report the results may be important here! Contrast the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dichotomous data (number of people experiencing an exacerbation)&lt;br&gt;FPS versus placebo&lt;br&gt;No significant difference: OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.19, four studies, N = 1109.&lt;br&gt;Mortality&lt;br&gt;FPS combination versus placebo&lt;br&gt;Data were separated according to the time point, since this would likely influence rates of mortality. Data were subgrouped for data at three years, data reported at 1-3 years, data at 1 year and data at 6 months. The adjusted hazard ratio from TORCH did not identify a significant effect of FPS over placebo (0.825, 0.681 to 1.002, P = 0.052). Analysed as number of deaths in each treatment group by odds ratio and combined with data from other four other studies, there was a small, significant reduction in the odds of death in favour of FPS versus PLA and FP (0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98, N = 4829). Since differing lengths of follow-up across the studies hinders the calculation of a single NNT, we have tabulated this for each study individually (see Table 02).&lt;br&gt;BDF versus placebo&lt;br&gt;The two studies of one year duration failed to detect a significant difference between BDF and placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia needs an NNTH to compare with the benefits in other outcomes please&lt;br&gt;Also add pneumonia to missing outcomes for BDF please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;?Add concerns re pneumonia to first paragraph and add a note in relation fo unknown dose benefit relationship for inhaled corticosteroid component. Also that TORCH is reassuring compared to SMART for mortality. Could we have some pictures to go in the text for the NNTs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for Practice&lt;br&gt;In my view the issue of ICS dosage is what needs to be further investigated rather than separate inhalers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new&lt;br&gt;Please add pneumonia story. Also reviewers' contributions could be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METAVIEW:&lt;br&gt;Tidy up order of presentation (GIV first? #3,5,6,7,16,24,28,29. Also 4#1,4,5,6,7,11. 7#1,2)/.

We particularly focused on whether combined inhalers are a good but safe treatment for adults with COPD.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>COPD is a serious respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. In most cases, it is caused by smoking. COPD is often treated by using inhalers. Currently, three types of inhalers combine a steroid and a 'long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist' (LABA). Steroids work by reducing inflammation in the airways, and LABA work by relaxing the muscles in the airways and opening them up. Using combined inhalers is more convenient than taking the two drugs separately but is also more expensive. We looked for evidence on whether giving a combined inhaler is better or worse than giving placebo (dummy inhaler).</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>Nineteen studies involving 10,400 people were included in this review. The studies lasted between 4 and 156 weeks. All of the people included in the studies had COPD of different severity. Both men and women were included, and most of the studies included only adults aged 45 or older.</P><P>All studies compared a combined inhaler with a placebo that was identical in appearance to the combined inhaler, so the people in the trials did not know whether they were taking the drug or the dummy inhaler. Some of the studies included two groups treated with the combined inhaler; one group was getting a higher dose and one group was getting a lower dose.</P><P>The evidence presented here is current to June 2013.</P><P>Most of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>We found that people receiving a combined inhaler were less likely to have a flare-up (&#8216;exacerbation&#8217;) of their COPD. The chance of having an exacerbation was reduced by about one quarter.</P><P>A small reduction in the risk of death was seen over three years, although most of the evidence about death comes from one large, long trial called TORCH. According to TORCH, approximately 42 people would need to be treated with a combined inhaler for three years to prevent one death.</P><P>We also found that people receiving combined inhalers had small improvements in quality of life, symptoms related to COPD and their breathing tests. However, these improvements may not have been very noticeable to them.</P><P>People treated with combined inhalers were more likely to have a lung infection called pneumonia. Again, most of the evidence about pneumonia comes from the TORCH trial. According to TORCH, when compared with placebo, for approximately every 17 people treated with combined inhaler, one extra person would get pneumonia.</P><P>People treated with combined inhalers were no more or less likely to experience serious unwanted events, including side effects, during treatment.</P><P>No consistent differences were found between the three different types of inhalers included in this review.</P><P>However, it is important to note that we cannot tell from this review whether it is the combination that is important or whether one of the two drugs in the combined inhaler may have had the real impact.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The evidence presented in this review is generally considered to be of moderate quality. Most of the studies did not clearly explain how they decided which people would receive the combined inhaler and which would receive placebo, and this is an important part of a well-conducted study. Also, more people receiving placebo dropped out of the trials than those receiving a combined inhaler. This often happened because of exacerbations of COPD. This means that by the end of the trial, the groups might have been unbalanced, and this could affect the accuracy of the results.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-28 09:35:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Both long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been recommended in guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Dichotomous data were analysed as fixed-effect odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and continuous data as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-28 09:35:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell"><P>Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria (with 10,400 participants randomly assigned, lasting between 4 and 156 weeks, mean 42 weeks). Studies used three different combined preparations (fluticasone/salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol or mometasone/formoterol). The studies were generally at low risk of bias for blinding but at unclear or high risk for attrition bias because of participant dropouts. Compared with placebo, both fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol reduced the rate of exacerbations. Mometasone/formoterol reduced the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbation. Pooled analysis of the combined therapies indicated that exacerbations were less frequent when compared with placebo (Rate Ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.78, 7 studies, 7495 participants); the quality of this evidence when GRADE criteria were applied was rated as moderate. Participants included in these trials had on average one or two exacerbations per year, which means that treatment with combined therapy would lead to a reduction of one exacerbation every two to four years in these individuals. An overall reduction in mortality was seen, but this outcome was dominated by the results of one study (TORCH) of fluticasone/salmeterol. Generally, deaths in the smaller, shorter studies were too few to contribute to the overall estimate. Further longer studies on budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol are required to clarify whether this is seen more widely. When a baseline risk of death of 15.2% from the placebo arm of TORCH was used, the three-year number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with fluticasone/salmeterol to prevent one extra death was 42 (95% CI 24 to 775). All three combined treatments led to statistically significant improvement in health status measurements, although the mean differences observed are relatively small in relation to the minimum clinically important difference. Furthermore, symptoms and lung function assessments favoured combined treatments. An increase in the risk of pneumonia was noted with combined inhalers compared with placebo treatment (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.94), and the quality of this evidence was rated as moderate, but no dose effect was seen. The three-year NNTH for one extra case of pneumonia was 17, based on a 12.3% risk of pneumonia in the placebo arm of TORCH. Fewer participants withdrew from the combined treatment arms for adverse events or lack of efficacy.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-28 09:35:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell"><P>Combined inhaler therapy led to around a quarter fewer COPD exacerbations than were seen with placebo. A significant reduction in all-cause mortality was noted, but this outcome was dominated by one trial (TORCH), emphasising the need for further trials of longer duration. Furthermore, we note there has been some debate about the appropriateness of the analysis conducted in the TORCH trial (see Feeback). Increased risk of pneumonia is a concern; however, this did not translate into increased exacerbations, hospitalisations or deaths. Current evidence does not suggest any major differences between inhalers in terms of effects, but nor is the evidence strong enough to demonstrate that all are equivalent. Importantly, we cannot comment on the relative contribution of the individual components of combined therapy to the effects identified, as this review presents only the pair-wise comparison between combined therapy and placebo. To permit firmer conclusions about the effects of combined therapy, more data are needed, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different formulations and doses of inhaled ICS. Head-to-head comparisons are necessary to determine whether one combined inhaler is better than the others.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:58:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:58:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in most industrialised countries, and it is projected to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2012</LINK>). The disease is predominantly caused by smoking. An estimated three million people are affected by COPD in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC2010</LINK>). COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome that is characterised by reduced post-bronchodilator lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC)) &lt; 0.7 in all patients (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2012</LINK>). Acute bronchodilator reversibility has traditionally been regarded as a characteristic of asthma, and only in the past few years has it been generally acknowledged that this clinical feature is also present in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2011</LINK>), as it was found in the UPLIFT study (<LINK REF="REF-UPLIFT-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">UPLIFT 2008</LINK>), in which 53% of participants had an increase of at least 200 mL in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> post-salbutamol. In TORCH, an increase in predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 10% was an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>). Patients with COPD generally show progressive lung function loss, accompanied by worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, cough and sputum) and health status (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2012</LINK>). These clinical features are a result of persisting and progressive airway inflammation (i.e. bronchial infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and increasing evidence of autoimmunity (<LINK REF="REF-Cosio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosio 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that some phenotypes of COPD involve chronic systemic inflammation that has an impact on co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aymerich-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aymerich 2011</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review focusses on combined inhalers that contain both an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA).</P><P>ICS, LABA and long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA) have been shown to be effective in a range of outcomes in COPD. ICS have not been shown to reduce the rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, although short-term increases in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and significant reductions in exacerbations have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>). LABA and LAMA reduce exacerbation frequency and symptoms and improve quality of life.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend either a LABA with an ICS in a combined inhaler, or with a LAMA, if FEV<SUB>1</SUB> is less than 50% predicted. Furthermore, the guidelines recommended combined ICS/LABA In people with stable COPD with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &#8805; 50% who remain breathless or have exacerbations despite maintenance therapy with a LABA (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC2010</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The evidence base for the addition of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists to inhaled steroids in asthma is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2009</LINK>). In asthma, the scientific rationale for combining LABA and ICS in a single inhaler relates to synergy of action. At a molecular level, ICS up-regulate the expression of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist receptors in bronchial smooth muscle. At the same time, LABA increase the genomic actions of ICS by promoting passage to the cellular nuclei. Thus, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and ICS may interact in a beneficial way, with ICS preventing the loss of function of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with long-term use, whereas beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may potentiate the local anti-inflammatory actions of ICS in people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2002</LINK>).</P><P>Some of these mechanisms may also be important in COPD. Several possible advantages associated with a combination of therapies have already been shown to improve outcomes. In particular, ICS in combination with LABA may have a greater effect than either treatment alone on the number of exacerbations, or on other outcomes such as quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>). One clinical rationale is based on patient convenience, with the expectation that a simplified inhaler regimen may lead to greater treatment adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2002</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This is an update of a previous review, which considered the effect of combined therapy compared with placebo, as well as both monocomponents separately, in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2004</LINK>). The availability of several new studies has prompted us to split the review between comparisons with placebo and those with monocomponents. This review summarises the evidence from clinical trials comparing combined ICS and LABA with placebo. Reviews of the comparison between combined therapy and ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>) or long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2012</LINK>) are published separately.</P><P>Concerns have been raised recently regarding the safety of LABA in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>). Moreover, questions have surrounded the validity of summary estimates from clinical trials that assessed exacerbation rates without accounting for follow-up time or adjustment for between-participant variability (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK>). Two well-known COPD guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCGC2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC2010</LINK>) had issued a strong recommendation regarding ICS/LABA combined therapy.

Thirteen studies involved a combined inhaler of fluticasone and salmeterol, four involved budesonide and formoterol and two involved mometasone and formoterol. The findings of this review complement those of two others assessing the effects of combination inhalers with their components, that is, LABA or ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>). Despite the addition of eight new studies for this update, most of the weight is still coming from the <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study, which is the largest trial of combined therapy (FPS) in COPD.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcomes</HEADING><P>The main findings related to the primary outcomes of exacerbations, mortality, pneumonia and hospitalisations appear in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. All eligible studies addressed at least one of the primary outcomes.</P><P>Combined therapy reduced the rate of moderate exacerbations compared with placebo by about a quarter (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). But, as was found in the Cochrane reviews comparing combined inhalers with LABA alone or ICS alone (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>), this did not translate to a statistically significant reduction in COPD hospitalisation rates. One explanation is that those receiving combined treatment who respond may have fewer and/or milder exacerbations, but equally the smaller number of hospitalisations means that less statistical power was present to show a significant difference. On the other hand, adverse effects were more common with combined treatment than with placebo, particularly the development of pneumonia. The NNTH for this outcome in studies of at least 52 weeks' duration varied from 17 to 197. Concern about pneumonia as an adverse event associated with ICS treatment has persisted ever since <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> was published in 2006. Indeed our analysis shows that the excess of pneumonia is seen only with FPS, not with the other combined inhalers. If the <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study was not included, the significant OR disappeared, but heterogeneity among trials is still evident (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), making it difficult to decide whether this effect is a true one. This may suggest ongoing difficulties with the accurate identification of pneumonia, or variations in participant populations, actions of medicines or the nature of lower respiratory tract infections and their treatment over the time course of a study. It is also possible that the heterogeneity in the pneumonia outcome is due to differential withdrawal rates. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy in the FPS subgroup was greater in the placebo arm (<LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>), as was seen with BDF (<LINK REF="CMP-003.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.18</LINK>) and MF/F studies (<LINK REF="CMP-004.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.8</LINK>). It is interesting to note that withdrawals due to adverse events were not different between arms in BDF (<LINK REF="CMP-003.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.17</LINK>), whereas for MF/F studies, withdrawals due to adverse events were greater in the placebo arm (<LINK REF="CMP-004.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.9</LINK>). These findings suggest something different about the three-year <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study compared with the others. Whatever the case, it is reassuring that this apparent excess of pneumonia cases did not translate into greater numbers of hospitalisations or exacerbations, or greater mortality rates. In fact, quite the opposite was noted&#8212;exacerbation rates and mortality were reduced with combined treatment.</P><P>We found that treatment with a combined inhaler led to a significant reduction in mortality compared with placebo when data from all studies were pooled. As with other outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> had a major influence on mortality; however, it should be noted that the <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> investigators did not claim a significant reduction in mortality with FPS over placebo (P = 0.052). The difference between the study report and the OR reported in this Cochrane review may be due to variations in statistical methods. <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> used a hazard ratio that was adjusted for repeated measurement. This analysis has been the subject of some debate as the study adopted a factorial design but did not report a factorial analysis (see <LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FBK-02" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 2</LINK>). Furthermore, although mortality was recorded in many of the studies, it was a primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>. In that study, cause-specific mortality was also reported, but the definition of a primary cause of death continues to pose challenges in a population of patients who may suffer from co-morbidities such as lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-McGarvey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGarvey 2007</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcomes</HEADING><P>We were unable to pool secondary outcomes and reported results for each type of combined inhaler separately. Although the only way to test whether one product is better than another is a head-to-head comparison, we found that the results for all secondary outcomes, except adverse events, were relatively similar, that is, each combined inhaler showed a small benefit over placebo in effects on health-related quality of life, symptoms, lung function, use of rescue medication and withdrawal rates. In some cases, the benefits reached accepted levels of clinical significance, but only just. Minimal clinical important differences (MCID) are sometimes used to help clinicians interpret trial findings in a meaningful way. The MCID for predose FEV<SUB>1</SUB> is thought to be approximately 100 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Donohue-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donohue 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Leidy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leidy 2003</LINK> suggests that changes of 1.0 in the BCSS represent substantial symptomatic improvement, changes of approximately 0.6 can be interpreted as moderate and changes of 0.3 can be considered small. A four-unit difference is the generally accepted MCID for SGRQ score (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). Mean differences reflect an unknown range of results from individual participants, and although an MCID may be achieved on average, this neither confirms nor rules out meaningful improvement over placebo for all. Furthermore, for some of these outcomes, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted, some of which may be due to differences in study protocols.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>Participants and outcomes reported were typical of those described for COPD patients. The most abundant evidence comes from studies on the FPS combination, which was the only one to show a mortality benefit. Fewer data are available for the MF/F combination, but nothing has been discovered to suggest that it behaves differently from the other inhalers.</P><P>This review addresses the efficacy and safety of combined ICS and LABA in one inhaler versus placebo as a pair-wise comparison. We did not seek to address the efficacy of the individual components (LABA and ICS) versus combined treatment, although such comparisons were included in some of studies in this review, notably the TORCH trial. In this large trial, it appears that the mortality benefit, while not reaching statistical significance, is driven largely by the LABA component of combined therapy. The efficacy of the individual components versus combined therapy is addressed in two linked Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>) and will be included in a forthcoming network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Oba-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oba 2017</LINK>).</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Most trials were industry-sponsored. The risk of bias in blinding was considered low for all trials. The risk of bias from attrition was considered higher because of the number of participants withdrawn (over 20% in most trials), especially as this group may represent a more severely involved subgroup (<LINK REF="REF-Kesten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kesten 2007</LINK>). In addition, we found significantly greater participant withdrawal in the placebo arm across all three combined inhalers (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.16</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>). However, the completion rate in the included trials was generally equal to, or better than, that of other trials involving participants with COPD. Selective reporting was generally considered to be of low risk.</P><P>Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted in all studies, but for outcomes such as mean exacerbation rates, withdrawal of severe frequent exacerbators from the studies may have distorted study findings because of the lower exacerbation rates seen with active treatment. Loss of participants with more frequent exacerbations from the studies may thus limit the accuracy of mean event rates. The question of exacerbations and the appropriate statistical analysis of rate ratios cast some doubt regarding the validity of some of the findings in this review. In particular, the large long-term studies (i.e. those in excess of six months), which are adequately powered to detect statistically significant findings, may overestimate the treatment effects of this therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK>). The method of weighting counts of exacerbations as described by <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK> (using duration of person follow-up time as a denominator in calculating the mean group rate of exacerbations rather than an unweighted approach) was undertaken in <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>;and <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>. In these studies, the effects were consistent and significantly favoured combination therapy over placebo. However, the major primary outcome after mortality rate was hospitalisation due to COPD exacerbation, and this did not show any difference between treatments.</P><P>Visual inspection of a funnel plot for the mortality outcome does not suggest publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The Cochrane Airways Group provided an excellent level of support in the identification of potentially relevant trials. To minimise the risk of selection and publication bias, an exhaustive search of the published literature and the unpublished literature, with no language restrictions, for potentially relevant clinical trials was underpinned by a systematic search strategy. Trial selection and data extraction followed a prespecified protocol, and the process was independently conducted by two review authors. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that additional unidentified trials may exist.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This Cochrane review confirms and builds upon an earlier one (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2004</LINK>) and upon related reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2013</LINK>). For this update, we checked all previous data and added hospital admissions using COPD-related serious adverse events as a surrogate marker. To enhance clarity, several outcomes in the FPS subgroup with few contributing studies have been deleted from the current update. We have added data for MF/F versus placebo, as these studies took place after the previous review.</P><P>Our finding that combined inhaler therapy reduced death is concordant with that of another review of all inhaled medications in COPD, which concluded that ICS/LABA was associated with the lowest risk of death among all treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 2013</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>For people with moderate or severe COPD, clinical benefit is derived when a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid are co-administered, compared with treatment with placebo, in terms of fewer exacerbations and possibly reduced risk of death. Furthermore, small benefits for quality of life and symptoms are noted. However, the effect of combined treatment on all-cause mortality is heavily weighted by one trial, which in itself was not reported to show a significant reduction. (This point added value to this review because the <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study alone did not achieve significance in mortality.) Despite positive effects on exacerbations and mortality, no effect on hospitalisation was reported. Moreover, a paradoxical finding indicates that fluticasone/salmeterol led to an increased risk of pneumonia. The NNTH to cause one additional case of pneumonia may be as low as 17, whereas the NNTB to prevent one death during the study period is 42.</P><P>Importantly, we have not commented on the relative contribution of the individual components of combined therapy to the effects identified, as this review presents only pair-wise comparisons between combined therapy and placebo. However, several included studies comprise intervention arms in which the individual components are compared to placebo and to combined therapy, providing information about the contributions of the individual components. We also note the debate about the appropriateness of analysis conducted in the TORCH trial (<LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FBK-02" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 2</LINK>). Furthermore, whether a combination is better than the two components taken separately was not addressed in this review.</P><P>Guidelines suggest that patients with symptomatic moderate to severe COPD should be given LABA or LAMA and possibly ICS; therefore it could be argued that this review is redundant. However, this review increased the level of evidence supporting the use of combined therapy (LABA/ICS) in COPD category "D" (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2012</LINK>). On the other hand, this review shows that use of a combination inhaler is not associated with large benefit in terms of symptoms or quality of life over placebo. The high attrition rate presented in many studies (in TORCH, 56% completed in the placebo group) could have overshadowed the benefits of those outcomes. Our review therefore supports the current widely accepted guidance for a stepwise approach to treatment of patients with mild or moderate disease. Combined therapy seems best indicated for COPD patients with post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 60% and frequent exacerbations and/or hospitalisations.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>Any study should carefully document trial participants using the new GOLD COPD grading criteria. A more standardised approach to recording of serious adverse events such as pneumonia, hospitalisation, intensive care support or death would provide a more accurate picture of the benefits and harms of the long-term effects of this form of therapy.</P><P>Pharmacoeconomic analyses would be helpful to assist purchasers of health care in making decisions about the cost-effectiveness of combined inhalers. Responder analyses should be reported; this might give an idea as to which COPD phenotypes may provide the greatest benefit.</P><P>Assessment of BDF and MF/F in larger and longer trials is required to reveal whether these preparations confer benefits for mortality similar to those provided by FPS. Head-to-head trials of combined inhalers are needed if benefits are to be compared in a robust fashion. Network meta-analysis may help further elucidate the relative contribution of the individual components of combined therapy to the effects identified, in addition to the information already provided by the multi-arm trials such as <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>.</P><P>Combined therapy should be compared with separate administration of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid at different doses in large-scale multi-centre studies using a double-dummy design, to assess whether combined therapy confers benefits over the simple addition of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist to different doses of inhaled steroid treatment in separate inhalers. A lower dose of ICS might still confer therapeutic benefit while reducing the incidence of pneumonia. The high attrition rate reported in many studies might be contemplated in future studies, to maintain the capacity of calculated sample size to show significant differences in outcomes such as quality of life, hospitalisation and death rates.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-11-20 12:15:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>The review authors are indebted to the Hamamelis Trust, which very generously funded the return travel for Dr Nannini to London to spend a week working on the development of the review.

beta-2 agonist), with placebo and write in their abstract that the number needed to treat to prevent one death with fluticasone/salmeterol was 42 (1). They explain, just before Objectives, that the largest randomised trial of combination therapy (TORCH) demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality versus placebo (P = 0.052) and that they wished to see whether other combined inhalers had a similar effect. Just above &#8220;Implications for research,&#8221; we are told that &#8220;whether a combination is better than the two components taken separately was not addressed in this review,&#8221; and under &#8220;Authors&#8217; Conclusions&#8221; the authors advocate that the combination should be compared with its two components.</P><P>I find this information misleading. Firstly, the review authors overlook that the TORCH trial (and several other trials) was designed to answer what they call for in future research, namely whether the combination was better than any of its components.</P><P>Secondly, the authors give readers the impression that the combination reduces mortality. However, the fact is that the steroid contributes absolutely nothing to the mortality benefit. The primary outcome in the TORCH trial was total mortality (2). GlaxoSmithKline randomised 6184 patients to four groups: placebo; salmeterol; fluticasone; and both drugs together. By definition, this design is factorial. It is powerful, as it allows the investigators to study three research questions with a sample size that would usually only allow one question to be answered. Such a trial can tell us whether the two drugs are effective, and whether the combination is better than any of its components. However, the analysis in the TORCH trial included only half of the patients, thereby spoiling the advantage of the factorial design, although the published trial protocol stated that a factorial analysis was to be performed (3).</P><P>Nowhere in the 15-page trial report is the factorial analysis to be found, and the abstract of the TORCH trial gives readers the impression that the combination was better than any of its components, which is the result the authors of the Cochrane review quote.</P><P>The authors of a letter to the editor used a factorial analysis and showed that the effect of the combination was entirely due to salmeterol (4); the hazard ratio for fluticasone was 1.00 (0.87 to 1.15), p = 0.99. In other similar trials, both GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca did not perform a factorial analysis (5).</P><P>Peter C Gøtzsche, <A HREF="mailto:pcg@cochrane.dk">pcg@cochrane.dk</A>, Director of the Nordic Cochrane Centre</P><P><B>References</B></P><P>1.

We would like to re-emphasise this review did not set out to elucidate the relative contribution of long-acting beta &#8211;agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to the benefits or harms associated with combination therapy. A separate Cochrane Review, comparing combined therapy with LABA alone, goes some way to addressing this issue; it shows no significant difference between treatments for mortality, but the confidence interval is too wide to support an assertion of no difference. (&#8220;There was no significant difference in mortality between people on combined inhalers and those on LABA, from 10 studies on 10,680 participants (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11, downgraded to moderate quality evidence due to statistical imprecision&#8221;<SUP>1</SUP>)</P><P>Furthermore, we disagree that the post-hoc factorial analysis of TORCH proves that fluticasone contributes &#8220;absolutely nothing&#8221; to the mortality benefit as the confidence interval (0.87 to 1.15) is again not sufficiently narrow to rule out possible benefit or harm.</P><P>Indeed, the authors of the article cited by Professor Gøtzsche acknowledge there is uncertainty about the impact of ICS, rather than completely ruling out a benefit: &#8220;in conclusion, after proper consideration of the various methodological shortcomings in the design and analysis of randomised trials, the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains doubtful, while the benefit observed with combination therapy may be due exclusively to the beneficial effects of the long-acting bronchodilator alone.&#8221;<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>We note from previous correspondence published in the New England Journal Medicine that there is some uncertainty about whether ICS and LABA may have some synergistic effect, and therefore factorial analysis would be less appropriate. In a response in 2007 the authors of the TORCH trial state: &#8220;factorial analysis assumes that each treatment has the same additive effect in the absence and presence of the other treatment. This was not the case for the TORCH trial. Our data show the clear clinical superiority of combination treatment with salmeterol and fluticasone, including fewer exacerbations and better health status.&#8221;<SUP>3</SUP></P><P>It is a Cochrane standard that conclusions are based solely on the evidence presented in the review. However, we have made some minor adjustments to the abstract, plain language summary and conclusions to highlight that we cannot comment on the relative contribution of the different components of combined therapy and it may not be the combination, per se, which is beneficial.</P><P>Nannini LJ, Poole P, Milan SJ, Holmes R, Normansell R.

Here is the review by Professor Julian Higgins:<BR/></P><P>The review addresses combination therapy versus placebo. The TORCH trial has a primary analysis that addresses this comparison, and all indications from the protocol documents are that this was planned as the primary analysis ("The primary objective of this study is to determine whether there is a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in COPD patients treated with SFC compared with placebo", from Vestbo et al, Eur Respir J 2004). Representation of the trial in the body of the review therefore looks entirely appropriate to me.</P><P>The question of whether the finding for combined therapy vs placebo is driven by one or other of the components does not seem relevant to the selection of the result or its inclusion in the Cochrane review, or indeed in conclusions drawn about the effect of combined therapy. I assume here that the objectives of the Cochrane review were not driven by observed findings of the TORCH trial, and in any case, I welcome the plans to perform a network meta-analysis to cover single and combined therapies.</P><P>I do not find any evidence in the 2004 protocol or the supplement to the 2007 paper (a more detailed protocol) that a factorial-style analysis was planned. I therefore do not concur with Peter Gøtzsche's apparent belief that the following text implies a factorial approach: "The other objectives of the study include comparisons of mortality in the SFC group with that seen in the salmeterol and FP groups, and in the salmeterol and FP groups compared with the placebo group." To me, these imply pair-wise comparisons of specific treatment groups, and not a plan to compare salmeterol vs no salmeterol and FP vs no FP, and similarly do not indicate a plan to investigate interaction between the two components (furthermore, the results of these particular analyses are clearly to be seen in Table 2 of the NEJM paper). Although I would consider the approach to analysing the trial to be surprising (NB not 'wrong'), given its factorial design, the analyses performed do seem to concur with the documents described as protocols. It is a concern, however, that the initial published protocol was submitted in October 2003, while within it, the protocol clearly indicates that it is retrospectively written: "The first patient was recruited in September 2000 and the last in November 2002."</P><P>I believe that remarks in the Authors' Conclusions sections of the Cochrane review would benefit from some clarifications. There is a claim that "Network meta-analysis may help elucidate the relative contribution of the individual components of combined therapy to the effects identified". Quite a lot of information about this is provided by the results of the TORCH trial for the particular components it evaluated, and it seems a little remiss to fail to comment on this. For issues around single vs combined therapy, the indication from the TORCH trial that salmeterol was driving the main result appears very relevant, and might be commented upon before calling for network meta-analyses to address the same question.</P><P>A subsequent comment is as follows: "Combined therapy should be compared with separate administration of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid at different doses in large-scale multi-centre studies using a double dummy design". Again, it looks as if the TORCH trial does this to some extent, so the call for new trials without recognizing this might be misplaced.</P></SUBSECTION></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 15:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>Feedback contributor: Peter C Gøtzsche, <A HREF="mailto:pcg@cochrane.dk">pcg@cochrane.dk</A>, Director of the Nordic Cochrane Centre</P><P>Author response: Nannini LJ, Poole P, Milan SJ, Holmes R, Normansell R. </P><P>Independent review: Julian Higgins, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol </P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM></FEEDBACK><APPENDICES MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><APPENDIX ID="APP-01" MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="1"><TITLE MODIFIED="2013-03-15 16:39:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Sources and search methods for the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR)</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-04 16:52:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Electronic searches: core databases</HEADING><TABLE COLS="2" ROWS="7"><TR><TH VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Database</B></P></TH><TH VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Frequency of search</B></P></TH></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Monthly</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>MEDLINE (Ovid)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Weekly</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>EMBASE (Ovid)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Weekly</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>PsycINFO (Ovid)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Monthly</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>CINAHL (EBSCO)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Monthly</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>AMED (EBSCO)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Monthly</P></TD></TR></TABLE><P> </P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Handsearches: core respiratory conference abstracts</HEADING><TABLE COLS="2" ROWS="9"><TR><TH VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Conference</B></P></TH><TH VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Years searched</B></P></TH></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2001 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>American Thoracic Society (ATS)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2001 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Asia Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2004 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>British Thoracic Society Winter Meeting (BTS)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2000 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Chest Meeting</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2003 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>European Respiratory Society (ERS)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>1992, 1994, 2000 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>International Primary Care Respiratory Group Congress (IPCRG)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>2002 onwards</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ)</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>1999 onwards</P></TD></TR></TABLE><P> </P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">MEDLINE search strategy used to identify trials for the CAGR</HEADING></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">COPD  search</HEADING><P>1.
