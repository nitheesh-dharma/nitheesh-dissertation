<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-13 13:25:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Kidney stones are most commonly formed from masses of crystals and protein. Movement of stones from the kidney through the urinary tract is a common cause of urinary tract obstruction in adults and can cause severe pain (colic). This review aimed to determine if increased fluids and diuretics or both could hasten the passage of stones and improve symptoms. Neither our initial review nor this subsequent update identified sufficient evidence to enable conclusions to be determined about the safety and effectiveness of increasing fluids or diuretics or both to treat people with acute ureteric colic. More and larger randomised controlled studies are required.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-30 14:53:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>Acute ureteric colic is commonly associated with severe and debilitating pain. Theoretically, increasing fluid flow through the affected kidney might expedite stone passage, thereby improving symptoms more quickly. The efficacy and safety of interventions such as high volume intravenous (IV) or oral fluids and diuretics aimed at expediting ureteric stone passage is, however, uncertain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-10-28 12:09:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>To look at the benefits and harms of diuretics and high volume (above maintenance) IV or oral fluid therapy for treating adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute ureteric colic.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:21:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (3 January 2012). Previously we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980) and handsearched reference lists of nephrology and urology textbooks, review articles, relevant studies, and abstracts from nephrology scientific meetings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-12 13:18:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including the first period of randomised cross-over studies) looking at diuretics or high volume IV or oral fluids for treating uncomplicated acute ureteric colic in adult patients presenting to the emergency department for the first time during that episode were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-28 12:11:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model for multiple studies of the same outcomes, otherwise the fixed-effect model was used. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-10 12:04:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>Two studies (enrolling 118 participants) examined the association between intense hydration and ureteric colic outcomes. There was no significant difference in pain at six hours (1 study, 60 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.57), surgical stone removal (1 study, 60 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.51) or manipulation by cystoscopy (1 study, 60 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.13) when no fluids over six hours was compared to three litres IV fluids administered over a six hour period. There was no difference in stone clearance (1 study 43 participants: RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.84), hourly pain score or patients' narcotic requirements (P &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons) when forced IV hydration of two litres over four hours was compared with minimal IV hydration at 20 mL/hour.</P>
<P>One study did not provide any details which would have allowed us to assess any of the risk of bias items (selection, detection, performance, attrition or reporting bias). The second study did not report the method of randomisation or allocation (selection bias - unclear), they reported that the patients were blinded to therapy (low risk of bias), analgesics were administered according to predetermined pain score criteria (low risk), and assessment of stone passage was unlikely to have been biased by knowledge of group assignment (low risk). However the second study also reported a high percentage of participants excluded post randomisation (26%; high risk of bias). We were unable to assess or ascertain any of the other risk of bias items.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-28 16:50:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>We found no reliable evidence in the literature to support the use of diuretics and high volume fluid therapy for people with acute ureteric colic. However, given the potential positive therapeutic impact of fluids and diuretics to facilitate stone passage, the capacity of these interventions warrants further investigation to determine safety and efficacy profiles.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-28 16:50:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:37:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>Nephrolithiasis is the presence of calculi (stones) in the kidney. Stone migration into the ureter can cause urinary tract irritation and damage, smooth muscle spasm, and partial or complete obstruction with subsequent urinary tract and renal capsule distension, and these symptoms are described as acute ureteric colic. Patients typically present with colicky unilateral flank pain (pain on one side of the body in the region from the abdomen to the back) that radiates to the groin on the same side of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Teichman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teichman 2004</LINK>). This is often associated with vomiting, and as the stone migrates toward the bladder, urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, dysuria, and gross haematuria can become prominent.</P>
<P>Nephrolithiasis has a prevalence of 1% to 10% and typically affects young, healthy adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ramello-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramello 2000</LINK>). Annual incidence is approximately 16/10,000 people, and lifetime incidence is 2% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Drach-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drach 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1988</LINK>). Peak incidence in males occurs at approximately 30 years of age, but incidence in women has two peaks: 35 years and 55 years. Around 1% to 2% of the affected population in Western countries are children (<LINK REF="REF-Asplin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asplin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramello-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramello 2000</LINK>). The probability of stone formation, composition, and location in the urinary tract appears to vary according to geographical region (<LINK REF="REF-Ramello-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramello 2000</LINK>). Irrespective of region, idiopathic nephrolithiasis (kidney stones of no known cause) occurs more in White populations than Black, and the disease has greater predilections for men than women in White and Asian populations, and for women than men in Black and Hispanic populations (<LINK REF="REF-Michaels-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michaels 1994</LINK>). In the United States, where nephrolithiasis prevalence is one of the highest in the world (13%), in 1993 the annual cost of treating the disease was estimated at USD 1.83 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A summary report on the management of ureteral stones by the American Urologic Association stated that "...up to 98% of stones less than 0.5 cm in diameter, especially in the distal ureter, may be expected to pass spontaneously" (<LINK REF="REF-Segura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1997</LINK>). The length of time from symptom onset to spontaneous stone passage varies, taking from hours to days or even longer. During this time patients may remain symptomatic and require continued treatment for pain control, and possibly, hospital admission. Hospital data demonstrate that admission rates escalate with age, which indicates age-related morbidity confirmed by findings of higher rates of infection in patients aged over 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ramello-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramello 2000</LINK>). Complications such as urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney function impairment, and prolonged duration of symptoms, are all indicators for invasive, definitive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Segura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current available therapies for acute ureteric colic include observation with analgesia, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy, blind basket extraction, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and open surgery. The American Urological Association's <I>Ureteral Stones Clinical Guidelines Panel Summary Report on the Management of Ureteral Calculi </I>recommends ESWL as first line treatment for most patients with stones up to 1 cm diameter in the proximal ureter, but similar stones in the distal ureter can be treated with either ESWL or ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenny-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miramatsu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miramatsu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sigala-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigala 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troxel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troxel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincendeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincendeau 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that most ureteral stones will pass spontaneously, conservative therapy in the form of observation with analgesia is the preferred approach, albeit one that often limits the patient's activities and can require repeated physician visits over a prolonged period (<LINK REF="REF-Segura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1997</LINK>). Surgical extraction is therefore performed as a consequence of failed conservative therapy.</P>
<P>The lifetime recurrence rate of nephrolithiasis is approximately 60% to 80% regardless of the type of initial treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Asplin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asplin 1996</LINK>). A number of therapies, including diuretics and increased fluid intake, have been shown to reduce the recurrence rate in idiopathic cases (<LINK REF="REF-Borghi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borghi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laerum-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laerum 1984</LINK>). Diuretics are not routinely recommended for people with acute ureteric colic, and fluids, typically administered intravenously, are given at maintenance volumes only to replace fluid lost from vomiting or reduced oral intake.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:39:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>High volume fluid therapy or administration of diuretics to increase renal output.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:39:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>In the acute setting, therapies that increase renal fluid output such as diuretics and high volume fluid therapy might theoretically facilitate stone passage and elimination because of the associated increased hydrostatic pressure within the ureter.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:41:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Wendy Bhanich Supapol">
<P>Faster stone elimination would reduce symptom duration and limit the adverse effects of an acute episode. It is also possible that if the stone does not move, high renal fluid output could cause a rapid pressure increase transmitted toward the kidney with potential to rupture the urinary tract wall and causing irreversible renal impairment.</P>
<P>If successful, the potential positive economic impact of treatment could be significant. Most patients with uncomplicated acute ureteric colic often wait until they become symptom free, or in the opinion of the treating urologist, require intervention. Timing of treatment may be dependent on available resources (<LINK REF="REF-Segura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1997</LINK>). Indirect costs in terms of lost wages for patients are substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therapies that accelerate stone elimination could potentially reduce symptom duration and associated hardships, decrease repeated physician visits and hospital admissions, and preclude invasive rescue procedures. Currently there are no proven treatments to provide this degree of benefit. Therefore, evidence of treatment with diuretics or high volume fluid therapy or both for patients with acute ureteric colic should be examined to determine effectiveness in facilitating stone passage with minimal risk of kidney impairment.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:46:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>This review sought to determine whether administration of diuretics or high volume (above maintenance level) IV fluids, or both, compared with placebo or no therapy for adult patients presenting to acute care settings (emergency departments) with symptoms of acute ureteric colic confirmed by imaging, had impact on symptom duration, physician visits, hospital admissions and durations, surgical procedures, or adverse events associated with the disease.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:23:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The 2005 systematic review was undertaken by AW and CR, and updated in 2012 by AW and WBS. The search strategies described were used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies relevant to the review. Titles and abstracts were screened independently by AW and CR for the 2005 review, who discarded studies that were not applicable. However, studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies were retained initially. For the 2005 review, AW and CR independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, if necessary, the full text of these studies to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. The same approach was applied by AW and WBS for the 2012 review update.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:22:36 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For the 2005 review, data extraction was carried out independently by AW and CR using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study existed, only the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were published in earlier versions only, these data were used. Any discrepancy between published versions was to be highlighted. There were no disagreements that required resolution by a third party. The same approach was applied by AW and WBS for the 2012 review update.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (surgical intervention, symptom relapse) results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (time to documented stone elimination, confirmed by stone retrieval from urine or not visualised on follow-up imaging; time to symptom relief; time to return to activities of daily living; serum creatinine level), the mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used.</P>

<P>Subgroup analysis was to be used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (such as participants, treatments and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could have been related to age and renal pathology. Heterogeneity in treatments could have been related to prior agents used and the agent, dose and duration of therapy. Adverse effects would have been tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, because they were likely to be different for various agents used. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was to be calculated for each adverse effect, either compared with no treatment or another agent.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Edna-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Edna 1983</LINK> enrolled and analysed 60 participants (48 male, 12 female) with acute pain due to ureteral stones who were admitted to a Norwegian hospital between February 1979 and September 1981. Participants were randomised to either Group A (30 participants; 24 male, 6 female; median age 47 years, range 15 to 62 years), who received no fluids for 6 hours; or Group B (30 participants; 24 male, 6 female; median age 46 years, range 22 to 73 years; P = 0.36) who received 2 L 5% glucose solution and 1 L Ringer's acetate solution IV over six hours. All participants received between 75 mg and 100 mg pethidine (determined by body weight) by intramuscular (IM) injection. Patients with signs of congestive heart failure were excluded. The median pain duration on admission among Group A participants was 13 hours (range 2 hours to 168 hours); and 11 hours for Group B (range 1 hour to 240 hours; P = 0.76). The median stone diameter in both Group A and Group B participants was 4 mm, but the range varied (Group A: 2 mm to 10 mm; Group B: 1 mm to 10 mm; P = 0.73). The principal outcome measure was a four-point patient-reported pain scale reported at six hours following treatment initiation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Springhart-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Springhart 2006</LINK> enrolled 58 patients who presented with symptoms of acute renal colic at the emergency department of a US hospital between March 2003 and October 2004. Of the 58 patients who were enrolled and randomised, 43 were included in the analysis. Of those 43 participants, 20 received forced IV hydration (2 L normal saline over 4 hours) and 23 participants received minimal hydration (20 mL normal saline per hour). Patients were blinded to hydration assignment. All participants received 30 mg ketorolac IV before enrolment. Most participants were male (69%), and the mean age was 41 years and similar between groups. Stone size was not significantly different between groups (3.4 mm versus 3.0 mm, P = 0.68). Pain was assessed using a visual analog pain scale every 10 minutes and morphine was given (initially at 0.07 mg/kg and subsequently at 2 mg/kg) as needed when pain was described as unbearable. There was no difference between the forced hydration and minimal hydration groups in any of the outcome measures including hourly pain score (P &gt; 0.40 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours), change in pain score over 4 hours (2.0 versus 2.0, P = 0.63), analgesic use measured in morphine equivalents (ME) (16.4 versus 15.4 ME, P = 0.72), or stone passage (30% versus 22%, P = 0.72).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Edna-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Edna 1983</LINK> did not report randomisation method, allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, completeness to follow-up or blinding of investigators, participants and outcome assessors.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Springhart-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Springhart 2006</LINK> blinded participants by covering IV fluid bags and pumps. Although it was reported that participants were blinded to hydration assignment, it was not clear whether investigators or outcome assessors were also blinded. Some exclusion criteria were assessed post-randomisation and 26% of enrolled subjects were not included in analysis. An intention-to-treat analysis was not conducted. Reasons for exclusion post-randomisation included: patients did not receive ketorolac as per study protocol (n = 4); no stone present on CT imaging (n = 9), and refusing CT imaging (n = 2). Loss of patients post-randomisation has the potential to bias the study results if the reason for exclusion was associated with hydration status allocation and an outcome. For example, if patients assigned to forced hydration passed their stones quickly, no stone may have been visibile on CT scan assessment and the patient would have been excluded. This would bias the results away from the hypothesis that forced hydration resulted in increased stone passage. In this study, exclusion from analysis was associated with treatment assignment: 11 participants were excluded from the forced hydration group, and four from the minimal hydration group (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The sample size was small, and the study is unlikely to have been sufficiently powered to detect some associations.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Edna-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Edna 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Springhart-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Springhart 2006</LINK> investigated the use of high volume fluid therapy for acute ureteric colic to facilitate stone passage and elimination. The paucity of published research meant that estimation of how widespread the practice of administering diuretics and or IV fluids to patients with acute ureteric colic was not possible. No benefit was observed in either study concerning the administration of high volume fluid therapy. Adverse events associated with fluid therapy were not reported. Concerns about urinary tract wall rupture and irreversible renal impairment may be theoretical, but without evidence to confirm such events, there can be no certainty. A survey of emergency physicians and urologists may answer both questions. Although the frequency of adverse events associated with this treatment practice could not be determined, reports of common use without adverse events would be reassuring and indicate that if complications do occur, they are rare. If such is the case, patients and clinicians may be more willing to participate in clinical studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-10-28 15:26:43 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>For patients with acute ureteric colic, therapies that increase renal fluid output, such as diuretics and high volume fluid therapy, might theoretically facilitate stone passage created by increased hydrostatic pressure within the ureter. This could offer positive financial impacts and shorten symptomatic time for patients. No equivocal published evidence for or against the use of diuretics and high volume fluid therapy to facilitate stone passage and elimination in patients with acute ureteric colic was identified.</P>
<P>Risks from using diuretics and high volume fluid therapy for patients with acute ureteric colic, specifically urinary tract wall rupture and irreversible renal impairment, outweighs any potential benefits, such as reducing symptom duration and numbers of physician visits. Therefore, despite there being no evidence for or against these therapies, they cannot currently be recommended.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-28 15:27:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Further studies are required to determine the safety and effectiveness of diuretics and high volume fluid therapy to expedite stone passage in people with acute ureteric colic.</P>
