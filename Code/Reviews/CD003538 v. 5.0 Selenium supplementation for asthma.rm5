I have made some CHANGES IN THE TEXT  IN RED.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis adjusted: &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Selenium is a trace mineral, and it is thought that deficiency of selenium may play some role in the development of asthma. Some studies suggest that selenium supplementation for people with chronic asthma may help to improve symptoms. This review found some evidence from only one small trial that selenium supplementation might help reduce symptoms of chronic asthma symptoms, but more research is needed to be certain.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Implications for practice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for practice amended:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One small trial found that selenium supplementation produced improvement in subjective symptoms for patients with chronic asthma but this was not supported by significant benefit in objective measurements. There is insufficient evidence to assess the use of selenium in clinical practice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the authors respond to the additional comments below:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I am a bit worried with the characterization of asthma and the reference. The characterisation is not in line with general accepted version among lung physicians, and increased mucus production is not an usual clinical sign of asthma.I would suggest an other and more correct and acceptable definition of asthma like in a monograph from ERS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the reflections regarding Selenium content in the soil, plants and animal foods and the prevalence of asthma needs an input of Selenium enriched foods, vitamin pills and fodder. I do not think, that the presented clear cut line of a low Selenium in soil, plants and animal food to high prevalence of asthma is to be generalised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be a consideration to include the reference of Thorling et al 1986 of a study  Selenium status in Europe to describe values from a relevant normal population.&lt;br&gt;Additional the the comments in the background section regarding a normal Selenium level, I might be a god idea to add, that a serum Selenium concentration less that 100 ng/ml, would be suboptimal for saturation of gluthathione peroxidase, as described by Thomson et al in 1977.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;_Edit by CJC  24 Oct&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the changes below.

WHAT IS A &amp;quot;LOW&amp;quot; SELENIUM LEVEL?&lt;br&gt;There is no fixed figure for normal serum selenium level. The serum concentrations of selenium reflect the dietary intake of selenium. Selenium concentrations in the plant and animal food in turn reflect selenium content of the soil. Thus, there is a great variation of selenium levels in different geographical regions. &lt;br&gt;For example, the population of New Zealand has low selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activities and a high prevalence of asthma. The low blood concentrations of selenium in the New Zealand population reflect a low dietary intake of selenium, usually less than 30 &amp;#166;&amp;#204;g per day. The low selenium concentrations reflect the very low selenium content of the soil, particularly &lt;br&gt;in the cereal growing areas of Canterbury and Otago. &lt;br&gt;The mean Selenium levels of healthy subjects according to different epidemiological studies are: &lt;br&gt;.

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Selenium supplementation for asthma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Selenium is a trace mineral, and it is thought that deficiency of selenium may play some role in the development of asthma. Some studies suggest that selenium supplementation for people with chronic asthma may help to improve symptoms. This review found some evidence from only one small trial that selenium supplementation might help reduce symptoms of chronic asthma symptoms, but more research is needed to be certain.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Selenium deficiency may be important in chronic asthma. Observational studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic asthma may have lower levels of selenium than their control. Nevertheless, selenium supplementation has not been recommended with drug therapy for asthma. This review systematically examines RCTs that evaluated the role of selenium supplementation in chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Recognition that chronic asthma can be associated with selenium deficiency has led to the investigation of the role of selenium supplementation in reducing the symptoms and impact of chronic asthma. The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of selenium supplementation as an adjunct to medication for the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE/PubMed, and EMBASE. Searches were current as of August 2005.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing patients with chronic asthma receiving selenium supplementation in conjunction with asthma medication, with patients taking asthma medication only.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers applied the study inclusion criteria</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial with a total of 24 patients suffering from chronic asthma was included. The study reported significant clinical improvement in the selenium-supplemented group, as compared with the placebo group, in terms of a 'clinical evaluation'. However, this improvement could not be validated by significant changes in separate objective parameters of lung function and airway hyper-responsiveness.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some indication that selenium supplementation may be a useful adjunct to medication for patients with chronic asthma. This conclusion is limited because of insufficient studies and lack of improvement in the clinical parameters of lung function.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the respiratory airways, is characterized by bronchial airway inflammation resulting in airway hyper-responsiveness, wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>). Oxidative processes, mediated by free radical chemistry, are recognized to contribute to its inflammatory pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fenech 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no fixed figure for normal serum selenium level. In 1986, a collaborative study was conducted to examine the levels of selenium in Europe. Serum samples was obtained from healthy individuals, aged between 20 and 65 years, from 17 locations in 10 different European countries. Mean serum selenium levels were ranged between 63 <U>+</U> SD 14 µg/L in Greece to 109 <U>+</U> SD 14 µg/L in London (<LINK REF="REF-Thorling-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorling 1986</LINK>). Meanwhile, mean selenium levels of healthy subjects according to different epidemiological studies are: <LINK REF="STD-Kadrabova-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kadrabova 1996</LINK>: mean plasma Se (ng/ml) in control subjects 58.4 <U>+</U> SD 1.2; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1989</LINK>: mean Plasma Se (µmol/L) in control subjects 1.19 <U>+</U> SD 0.19; <LINK REF="STD-Flatt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flatt 1990</LINK>; mean plasma Se (ng/ml) in control subjects 60.6 <U>+</U> SEM 1.8; <LINK REF="STD-Fenech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fenech 1998</LINK>: mean plasma Se (ng/ml) in control subjects 114.4 <U>+</U> SD 4.7.<BR/> <BR/>The accumulated data indicate that asthma is associated with reduced circulatory selenium status and lowered activity of the selenium-dependent enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which may have aetiological implications, considering its important role in the cellular elimination of hydroperoxides (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasselmark-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hasselmark 1993</LINK>). It has been suggested that a serum Selenium concentration less that 100 ng/ml would be suboptimal for saturation of glutathione peroxidase (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several epidemiological studies have observed lowered selenium status in asthma patients (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flatt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flatt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kadrabova-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kadrabova 1996</LINK>). In addition, it has been reported that selenium supplementation might be beneficial to patients with intrinsic asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Kadrabova-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kadrabova 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although selenium may be safer than new agents especially in patients with other chronic diseases, it is still not used as supplementary treatment to steroids and beta agonists. The level of selenium deficiency that is associated with disease is not clearly established. Similarly, the ability of supplementation protocols to reverse this deficiency is also not well established. </P>
<P>To our knowledge there has been no systematic review of the use of supplementary selenium in the treatment of asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of the review is to assess the efficacy of selenium supplementation in asthma.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>The review was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which studied the efficiency of selenium as supplementary treatment in chronic asthma. Double blinded trials were preferred, but single blind and open studies were also reviewed for possible inclusion. No restriction was placed on the language of publications.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants were adults or children (over the age of 2 years) with a diagnosis of asthma. Asthma was diagnosed by solely clinical diagnosis by physicians as well as specific objective criteria. All healthcare settings (community/primary care, hospital outpatient or long-stay institutional) were considered eligible.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Selenium administered as a supplementary treatment for at least 2 weeks, versus placebo.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure considered was symptom score. </P>
<P>Secondary outcomes considered were:<BR/>1) Lung function (FEV1, % predicted FEV1, diary and clinic PEFR and PEFR variability).<BR/>2) Selenium level post-intervention (if available).<BR/>3) Selenium-dependent enzyme glutathione peroxidase function post-intervention (if available).</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>An initial search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Regsister of asthma trials. Additional and separate searches were carried out on MEDLINE (1966-2005), EMBASE (1980-2005), PubMed and also on all relevant respiratory journals that were available electronically. </P>
<P>For this review, the Specialised Register was searched using the term: selenium*</P>
<P>Review articles and bibliographies of each RCT identified were searched for additional references that contained further RCTs. Personal contact with colleagues, collaborators and other trialists working in the field of asthma were made to identify other published and unpublished relevant studies.</P>
<P>Update searches have been run up to August 2005.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>SELECTION OF TRIALS: <BR/>Abstracts of articles identified using the search strategy above were viewed, and articles that appear to fulfil the inclusion criteria were retrieved in full. Data on at least one of the outcome measures were included in the study.<BR/>Each article identified were reviewed and categorised into one of the following groups:<BR/>-included: RCT that met the described inclusion criteria and those where it was impossible to tell from the abstract, title or MESH headings;<BR/>-excluded: non RCT.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (MFA and RAL) reviewed 10 papers retrieved and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria of RCTs. Only one trial was appropriate for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Hasselmark-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hasselmark 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION:<BR/>Data were independently extracted by the two reviewers (MFA and RAL) and cross-checked. Data were entered into RevMan 4.2 where possible. </P>
<P>For continuous variables data were extracted and entered as WMD. For dichotomous variables, data were extracted and entered as Odds Ratios (OR). No data could be pooled but any heterogeneity identified in future updates of the review will be explored on the basis of asthma severity and dose of selenium.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search strategy yielded a total of 20 references. Eleven papers were retrieved, of which ten were excluded as they were non-randomised studies (See Characteristics of Excluded Studies'). One trial met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hasselmark-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hasselmark 1993</LINK>). For a full description please see 'Table of Characteristics of Included Studies'. An update search in August 2004 did not identify any new studies for inclusion or exclusion in the review. </P>

<P>Twenty four participants were recruited to the study. Participants suffered from chronic intrinsic asthma. Patients were excluded if they had atopic disease. Patients with recent or acute infections were excluded. Participants were recruited from a chest clinic. None of the participants had taken oral steroids or antibiotics in the previous three months. Patients had not taken selenium or vitamin E preparations in the previous six months. </P>
<P>The patients were allowed to use their habitual asthma drugs, which included beta agonist, theophyllines, and inhaled corticosteroids, but when extra medication was needed, this was noted in a protocol. </P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following outcomes were assessed in the study: Clinical evaluation (this was a composite score based on changes in vital capacity, forced expiratory volume/ 1 second, histamine challenge, morning/evening peak expiratory flow, need of extra medication, and subjective judgment of the patient. This was dichotomised as deterioration, unchanged, or improved); lung function; biochemical markers. </P>
<P>During the first 2 weeks of the pre-intervention period and the last 2 weeks of the intervention period, the patients took measurements of peak expiratory flow each morning and evening. Measurement was also taken of serum selenium concentrations and of glutathione peroxidase activity in platelets.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The included study was randomised, controlled and double blinded. The method of randomisation was not reported.<BR/>After the experimental period, there had been drop out of one patient (with NSAID-intolerance) for the selenium group and two patients (without NSAID-intolerance) form the placebo group. The reasons for the dropouts were in two cases other somatic disease, and in one case domestic reasons. </P>
<P>Whilst the study was described as randomised, the methods used were not reported. In addition to this the study sample was small and all the participants recruited suffered from intrinsic asthma.</P>

</P>
<P>This was a composite score of several clinical and subjective outcomes (lung function (FVC, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, histamine challenge, morning/evening PEF and subjective judgement). In the assembled clinical evaluation made of each patient, seven were classified as improved after the intervention period, while the other 13 were judged to be clinically unchanged or deteriorated. Breaking the code revealed that in the group of patients classified as improved six were from the selenium group (two with NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory)-intolerance) and only one (with NSAID-intolerance) was from the placebo group, a difference in distribution which was statistically significant. (P = 0.042). </P>

<BR/>The were no significant differences regarding the basal values of either selenium or glutathione peroxidase activity in platelets between the selenium group and the placebo group. The authors also failed to find any differences in basal values between the patients with NSAID-intolerance, as compared with patients without NSAID-intolerance. </P>
<P>When the basal values were compared with the final values, there were significant increases in the selenium group both in the serum selenium and platelet glutathione peroxidase (P &lt; 0.001), while no significant changes could be observed in the placebo group (no p values reported).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>It must be noted that our systematic review concerns itself only with studies which have used selenium as an 'add-on' to usual treatment for chronic asthma and not as an alternative. </P>
<P>After a comprehensive search, we could localize only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hasselmark-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hasselmark 1993</LINK>). To our knowledge, no other RCT intended to assess the value of selenium supplementation in chronic asthma since then. Professor Jon Ayres (Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, UK) planned a pilot study of supplementation with magnesium, selenium and vitamins A, C and E in subjects with type 1 brittle asthma in 1998. However, Professor Ayres and his colleagues decided not to proceed with the study because of the diverse confounding factors (personal communication).</P>
<P>Various case-control studies over the last fourteen years confirmed that asthmatic patients had lower level of selenium than their control. However, these studies did not determine the degree of selenium deficiency that is believed to be significant. Few of these studies reported the same for glutathione peroxidase function (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flatt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flatt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasselmark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hasselmark 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kadrabova-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kadrabova 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Misso 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>The only localized RCT reported significant clinical improvement in the selenium supplemented group, as compared with the placebo group, with regard to the assembled clinical evaluation made for each patient. However, this improvement could not be validated by significant changes in the separate clinical parameters of lung function and airway hyper-responsiveness. This could be explained by the small sample size of the study (selenium group N = 10; placebo group N = 10).</P>
<P>Another important finding is that in the selenium supplemented group when the basal values were compared with the values after 14 weeks of daily supplement of 100 mcg sodium selenite, there were significant increases both in serum selenium and platelet glutathione peroxidase (p&lt;0.001). </P>
<P>It is possible that the supplemental dosage given was too low and that a supplemental dose of 200-250 mcg might be more beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jahnova-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jahnova 2002</LINK> examined the effects of selenium supplementation in corticosteroid dependant asthmatics with lowered circulatory selenium status. The asthmatics were receiving 200 mcg of selenium per day for a period of 6 months, in addition to regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and beta agonists. The expression of adhesion molecules on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of asthmatics before and after 3 and 6 months of selenium supplementation was assessed. The results of the study have demonstrated that selenium is able to affect the adhesion molecule expression that are crucial in the inflammatory process of asthma.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>One small trial found that selenium supplementation produced improvement in subjective symptoms for patients with chronic asthma but this was not supported by significant benefit in objective measurements. There is insufficient evidence to assess the use of selenium in clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This appears to be a field of treatment for asthma that warrants further research. This would require larger randomised trials, standardised rating scales and outcome measures, at similar time periods. Such studies are important in the light of the growing body of evidence supporting theories that the impact of asthma is not based upon molecular or organic processes alone, but involves a complex interrelationship between these and psychological phenomena.</P>
