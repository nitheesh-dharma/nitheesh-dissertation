<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Most very low birth weight infants grow slowly in hospital after delivery. This causes concern because poor growth can link to neurodevelopmental impairments including decreased cognitive ability (IQ), speech, and reading skills when school-aged. Fat provides about half of the energy source (calories) in human breast milk, mostly as long-chain fatty acid triglycerides (LCT). As a way of improving growth, fat can be added to formula used to feed preterm infants. Fats in formula can contain triglycerides with long chain fatty acids or shorter medium chain fatty acids (MCT). MCT are more easily absorbed by the newborn infant with an immature digestive system. LCT are still important in the development of visual acuity and development of cell membranes and the brain. The review authors searched the medical literature. They found eight small controlled randomized studies looking at short-term growth (weight, length, and head circumference gain) in preterm infants fed with varying amounts of medium chain fats. The pattern of growth in infants fed exclusively with high MCT or low MCT formula for at least one week did not differ (five studies with 182 infants). These infants had a mean gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks, mean birth weights between 1 kg and 1.5 kg, and were aged one to six weeks. One study found a high degree of gastrointestinal intolerance with high MCT content and another did not. Development of necrotizing enterocolitis was not different. No studies addressed long-term growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In-hospital growth of most very low birth weight infants remains below the 10th percentile of reference intrauterine growth curves (Ehrenkranz 1999). To improve growth, fat is added to preterm formula in the form of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) or long chain triglycerides (LCT). MCT are easily accessible to the preterm infant with an immature digestive system while LCT are beneficial for central nervous system development and visual function. Both have been incorporated into preterm formulas in varying amounts, but their effect on the preterm infant's short-term growth is unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of high MCT as opposed to low MCT (high LCT) formula on short-term growth rates in preterm formula fed infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE (1966 - 2007), CINAHL (1982 - 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles were searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomized trials comparing the effects of exclusive feeding of high versus low MCT formula (for a minimum of one week) on the short-term growth of healthy, preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The reviewers assessed each study's quality and extracted data on growth parameters as well as adverse effects from included studies. All data used in analysis were continuous; therefore, weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight randomized trials studying a total of 182 infants were included. </P>
<P>There was no evidence of difference in short-term growth parameters when high and low MCT formulas were compared. The meta-analysis of weight gain based on five studies yielded a WMD of -0.35 g/kg/d (95% CI -1.44, 0.74). Similarly, meta-analysis of weight gain in g/d based on two studies showed no evidence of difference (WMD 2.09 g/d, 95% CI -1.46, 5.64). Length gain, based on five studies, showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31). Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a non-significant WMD -0.03 cm/wk (95% CI -0.15, 0.08). Only one study reported a statistically non-significant skin fold thickness gain, with a mean difference -0.15 mm/wk (95% CI -0.41, 0.11). </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses according to % MCT in the high MCT formula, by 10% intervals showed no evidence of effect of high MCT on short-term weight gain within any subgroup. </P>
<P>There are conflicting data (two studies) as to formula tolerance.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of effect on incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), based on small numbers in two trials.</P>
<P>No studies were located addressing long-term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence of difference between MCT and LCT on short-term growth, gastrointestinal intolerance, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Therefore, neither formula type could be concluded to improve short-term growth or have less adverse effects. Further studies are necessary because the results from the included eight studies are imprecise due to small numbers and do not address important long-term outcomes. Additional research should aim to clarify effects on formula tolerance and on long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and include larger study populations to better evaluate effect on NEC incidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>The in-hospital growth of most very low birth weight infants remains below the 10th percentile of reference intrauterine growth curves (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1999</LINK>). Poor neonatal head growth has been linked to significant neurodevelopmental outcomes including decreased IQ, speech, and reading skills in school aged children (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>). Significant effects on IQ scores of preterm infants have been seen when comparing a standard versus "enriched" formula diet, emphasizing the importance of the preterm infant's early nutrition on later cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dietary energy is essential for promoting growth in the preterm infant. Fat is an integral energy source, and is also needed for cell membranes and proper brain development. Fat comprises 40 - 50% of calories in human milk or formula (<LINK REF="REF-Hamosh-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamosh 1991a</LINK>). Long chain triglycerides (LCT) contain long chain fatty acids which make up 75 - 80% of all fatty acids in human milk. The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), a subset of long chain fatty acids, are higher in preterm as compared to term human milk. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) comprise 10% of all lipids in human milk for full term babies and 17% of human milk for preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Bitman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bitman 1983</LINK>). The absorption of LCT requires pancreatic lipase, mixed micelles, chylomicrons, and carnitine. Since the amounts of pancreatic lipase and bile salts may be limited in early life, lingual and gastric lipases have an important role in hydrolyzing MCT to free fatty acids. This allows for direct gastric and intestinal absorption into the serum without micelles. The medium chain fatty acids are then transported via serum albumin directly to the liver. They may enter the mitochondria for beta oxidation without the help of carnitine (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infant formula is composed of fat in the form of LCT or MCT in varying percentages. The range is from less than 10% of fat as MCT (greater than 90% of fat as LCT) to over 80% of fat as MCT (less than 20% of fat as LCT). For the purposes of this review, high MCT formula contains 40% or more by weight of fat as MCT while low MCT formula contains 20% or less of fat as MCT. The decision to utilize a high or low MCT formula is a difficult one. The significance of LCT lies in a greater resemblance to human milk fatty acids than MCT. Furthermore, LCPUFA such as arachidonic acid and docosahexanoic acid largely accumulate in the central nervous system and retina during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first postnatal year (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2006</LINK>). Preterm infant formulas supplemented with LCPUFA have been demonstrated to be beneficial for visual function and central nervous system development (<LINK REF="REF-Fleith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heird-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 2005</LINK>). However, it is important to note that LCPUFA comprise a very small percentage of the total LCT content of preterm formulas. On the other hand, absorption of MCT in the preterm neonate may be easier than LCT due to the alternative route of digestion utilizing lingual and gastric lipases. Thus MCT can act as an easily accessible fuel source, but may also stimulate the production of ketone bodies by the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>One common clinical way of answering such nutritional value questions is based on growth parameters. Besides growth, issues of adverse outcomes are important. Whether preterm infants may tolerate high or low MCT formula better or have a higher risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with high or low MCT formula has not been extensively addressed in the literature. However, several reviews of human and animal research note the easier absorption of MCT for the preterm infant through gastric and lingual lipase which circumvent the more complicated processes LCT must go through to be digested (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borum 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odle 1997</LINK>). Thus MCT are recommended for malabsorptive processes (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1992</LINK>). An added issue complicating replacement of one type of triglyceride over the other is the slight difference in caloric density, such that MCT is 8.1 kcal/g and LCT is 9.3 kcal/g (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review addressed the question of the effects of high versus low MCT formula on growth, adverse effects, and neurodevelopmental sequelae in the preterm infant. In addition, since MCT are especially useful in preterm infants with underdeveloped digestive systems, the reviewers postulated that subtle differences in weight gain might have been uncovered if infants were to be stratified by birth weight, since lower birth weight infants might utilize MCT to a greater extent. Exclusively formula fed infants were chosen, because exposure to human milk can decrease incidence of NEC and may improve gastrointestinal tolerance, two important possible adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vohr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 1999</LINK>). Since varying amounts of MCT in formulas exist, the question of whether a particular percentage of MCT in formula affected weight gain was also investigated.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of formula containing high as opposed to low MCT on early growth. In addition, the review will analyze effect on short-term growth according to percentage of MCT in formula.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes included increases in head circumference, length, skin fold thickness, and overall rate of weight gain over at least seven days. Planned secondary outcomes included neurodevelopmental assessment and weight gain less than the intrauterine rate (15 gm/kg/d). Incidence of adverse effects defined as gastrointestinal intolerance or NEC were recorded. Two subgroup analyses for effect on weight gain were planned based on stratifying by birth weight and percentage of MCT within formulas.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomized control trials were considered for this review. Quasi-randomized studies were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>INCLUSION: Preterm (&lt; 37 week gestation), exclusively formula fed, appropriate size for gestational age (AGA) infants in a hospital setting who were otherwise healthy and whose growth parameters were monitored for a week or more.</P>
<P>EXCLUSION: Any history of surgery, major congenital malformations, pre-existing major illnesses (including necrotizing enterocolitis or sepsis), requirement for ventilatory assistance or supplemental oxygen (at the time of enrollment), gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks. Studies including infants fed human milk during or before study initiation were excluded since human milk could affect gastrointestinal tolerance and NEC incidence, two important possible adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vohr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Random allocation of infants to diets which are exclusively enteral feeds of either high or low MCT formula over at least one week. For the purpose of this review, high MCT formula was defined as 40% or more by weight and low MCT formula as 20% or less by weight. Studies with infants on either control or experimental arm for less than one week were excluded. Furthermore, studies were also excluded if infants received any diets which incorporated human milk prior to or during the study due to potential effect on gastrointestinal tolerance and protective effects against NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vohr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 1999</LINK>).</P>

<B>Study Eligibility</B>
<BR/>Twenty-one possibly eligible studies were identified. Eight randomized control trials met inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). Three of these were randomized cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>); the remainder were parallel-group trials. All eight trials compared short-term growth of preterm infants receiving an exclusive diet of either high or low MCT formula. The percentage of MCT within the formulas varied from study to study. Data eligible for the review were extractable from all included studies except <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>Thirteen studies were excluded. Four studies were excluded because it was not clear that they were randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Aerde-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Van Aerde 1985</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bustamante-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bustamante 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1992</LINK>) were excluded as there were infants in the studies who were exposed to varying amounts of human milk, which could possibly impact on tolerance and incidence of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vohr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 1999</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Telliez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Telliez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telliez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Telliez 2002</LINK>) were excluded because they studied growth for only three days rather than at least a week. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>) was excluded because it only studied growth to day five. Finally, three studies were excluded because they used MCT formulations which were not high enough to meet our criterion for high MCT (<LINK REF="STD-Carnielli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carnielli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>All eight trials described the participants as preterm infants who were free from disease. Mean gestational ages for the infants included in the eight trials ranged between 29 and 32 weeks and mean birth weights ranged from 1010 g to 1476 g. The average postnatal age of the infants upon study entry was highly variable between the eight trials and ranged from one to six weeks. The participants were clearly stated to be AGA infants in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK> utilized a standard deviation score (SDS) that subtracts the mean birth weight for gestational age from the actual birth weight and then divides by one standard deviation for that gestation (-2.1+/-1.9 MCT vs. -1.9+/-1.5 LCT); this study (<LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>) includes small for gestation infants (SGA) of unknown number. The other studies did not mention size for gestational age. </P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>There was considerable variability between trials in the percentage of MCT contained within each formula. It was assumed that MCT + LCT = 100% lipid to determine percentages that were not detailed in certain studies. When different types of MCT percentages were reported, percentage by weight was used. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>) compared short-term growth of infants receiving two formulas, a high MCT (38 - 50%) and a low MCT (0% - 14%) formula. The two studies which used more than two formulas were <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> (&lt; 10%, 40%, 80% MCT) and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> (5%, 17%, 30%, 43% MCT). For <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>, the group fed the highest percentage MCT formula was used as the high MCT group in the analyses comparing high MCT vs. low MCT. <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> were the only trials that were unclear if percentages of MCT cited were percentages by weight.</P>
<P>Study duration for the majority of the included trials was about one week of full feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). Two studies included infants on full feeds for greater than one week (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK> used a study period of about two weeks of full feeds, but weight gain was based on the second week only. </P>
<P>Consent for one protocol was stated as obtained only from parents who had previously made the decision not to breast feed (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). The remainder of the studies did not state that human milk was never part of the infants' diet, but it was assumed that this was the case. </P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>Primary outcomes of interest for meta-analysis were short-term growth parameters, reported in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> reported starting and ending weights but no growth rates. Analyses of effects on short-term weight gain according to percentage of MCT formula (grouped by 10 percentage points) compared to high LCT formula were done. Secondary outcomes of tolerance of formula (emesis, transit time) or incidence of NEC were described to varying degrees in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). No studies addressing long-term growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes were located in the search.</P>

<P>See: Table of Included Studies</P>
<P>Random allocation was claimed in all included studies, but the technique used for sequence generation was not described in any of the studies. Two trials described allocation concealment which in both cases was via opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). Short-term follow-up for all studies was complete, and all babies were accounted for.</P>
<P>Blinding of interventions and outcomes was rarely described. More often, blinding was mentioned, but not clearly how or of whom. <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK> describes special alphabetical codes for the formula, blinding both the clinical team and investigators of the intervention (outcome blinding is not clear). <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK> mention blinding caretakers but not the methodology involved, and do not mention blinding intervention/outcome from researchers. <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> also refers to the blinding of the clinical team for intervention (without describing the method employed) and then clearly states that the researchers were not blinded (suggesting no blinding of outcomes). <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> labels the study as "blinded", but does not detail the methods of blinding or whether intervention, outcome, or both were blinded. No description or mention of blinding occurred in the three remaining trials (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>HIGH MCT FORMULA VS. LOW MCT FORMULA (COMPARISON 01):</B>
</P>
<P>There were 182 infants from eight randomized trials included in the present analysis of short-term growth parameters. Effects on the rate of weight gain were analyzed by high vs. low MCT formula and by percentage of MCT. Effects on clinical tolerance and NEC were assessed. Effects on neither neurodevelopmental nor long-term growth were assessed in the included studies. Planned subgroup analysis to assess effect on rate of weight gain by birth weight was not done, since only a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>) included individual birth weights (but not corresponding individual rates of growth) while the remainder only reported mean birth weights and mean weight gain. The adverse outcome of growth less than or equal to intrauterine growth, 15 g/kg/d, could not be analyzed since all rates of weight gain recorded were greater than 15 g/kg/d. No metabolic data were analyzed as such data were not deemed to be clinically significant to the initial question.</P>
<P>
<B>Short-term growth parameters<BR/>Weight gain (g/kg/d) (Outcome 01.01 and 01.03 - 01.05):</B>
<BR/>Five small trials report this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). No individual trial found a statistically significant effect. The meta-analysis shows no evidence of effect of high MCT formula on weight gain (WMD -0.35 g/kg/d, 95% CI -1.44, 0.74). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect among these five trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis was done according to %MCT (by 10 percentage point intervals) (Outcomes 01.03 - 01.05):<BR/>
</B>Three trials assessed effect on weight gain (g/kg/d) of 31-40% MCT formula compared to a low MCT formula (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1993a</LINK>). Two trials assessed the effect on weight gain of 41 - 50% MCT (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). One trial reported the effect on weight gain of a 71 - 80% MCT formula (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>). None of the individual trials found a statistically significant effect on weight gain and the respective meta-analyses showed no evidence of effect. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect within these meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Weight gain (g/d) (Outcome 01.02): </B>
<BR/>Two small trials report this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>). Of note, <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK> reported weight gain once within the text as g/kg/d, but in Table 5 and the abstract, the reported unit of weight gain was g/d. In this review, the unit was assumed to be g/d. Neither trial found a statistically significant effect. The meta-analysis shows no evidence of effect of high MCT formula on weight gain (WMD 2.09 g/d, 95% CI -1.46, 5.64 g/d). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect among the two trials.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Length gain (cm/wk) (Outcome 01.06):</B>
<BR/>Five small trials report this outcome, using units of either cm/d (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>) or cm/wk (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>). When length was cited in cm/d, this number was converted to cm/wk by multiplication by seven. No individual trial found a statistically significant effect. The meta-analysis shows no evidence of effect of high MCT formula on length gain (WMD 0.14 cm/wk, 95% CI -0.04, 0.31). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect among the five trials.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Head circumference gain (cm/wk) (Outcome 01.07):</B>
<BR/>The same small five trials that report length increase also report this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). As with length, head circumference increase is reported in either cm/d or cm/wk (converted here to cm/wk by multiplication by seven). No individual trial found a statistically significant effect. The meta-analysis shows no evidence of effect of high MCT formula on head circumference increase (WMD -0.03 cm/wk, 95% CI -0.15, 0.08). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect among these five trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Skin fold thickness gain (mm/wk) (Outcome 01.08):</B>
<BR/>One small trial assessed this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>) and did not find a statistically significant effect. The meta-analysis shows no evidence of effect of high MCT formula on skin fold thickness increase (MD -0.15 mm/wk, 95% CI -0.41, 0.11).</P>
<P>
<B>Indirect growth measurements:</B> <BR/>One small trial reports growth indirectly (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). This study reports means for starting and ending weights (gm), lengths (cm), head circumferences (cm), and study duration. No measures of variance for any of these data are reported, so the data could not be used in meta-analysis in this review. However, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> reported no statistically significant effect on growth of any of four different MCT% formulas.</P>
<P>
<B>Gastrointestinal tolerance:</B>
<BR/>Clinical signs of intolerance: Two small studies report clinical signs of intolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> found that 10 of 11 infants assigned to either 40% or 80% MCT (vs. one of 10 infants assigned to the low MCT formula) demonstrated at least one of the following symptoms: "tense abdominal distension, loose stools, vomiting, gastric aspirates that were bilious or contained occult blood". <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> found that residual aspirates, vomiting, and abdominal distension were similarly uncommon across the four formulas (5% MCT, 17%, 30%, and 43%MCT). Of the 60 infants included in <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>, two demonstrated formula intolerance (one, who was from the lowest percentage of MCT formula group, was diagnosed with sepsis and NEC; and the second, who was from the 17% MCT formula group, demonstrated abdominal distension and aspirates).</P>
<P>
<B>Stool transit time (hours): </B>
<BR/>One small study reports this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK>). This trial did not find a statistically significant effect. However, a trend of higher mean carmine red transit time for higher MCT formulas (21.6 hours for the control group, 32.1 hours for 40% MCT, and 32.4 hours for 80% MCT formula) was noted. </P>
<P>
<B>Fecal output (g/kg/d): </B>
<BR/>One small trial reports this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK>). This trial did not find a statistically significant effect, although fecal output was slightly higher in the low MCT group (2.6+/-0.84 high MCT vs. 3.6+/-1.4 g/kg/d low MCT).</P>
<P>
<B>NEC:</B>
<BR/>Case occurrence: Two small trials report the occurrence of NEC (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> noted one infant with NEC in the low MCT formula group and <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK> withdrew one infant for the same reason after enrollment but prior to study initiation. Based on these small numbers, there appears to be no evidence of difference in NEC incidence.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Analysis of the data derived from eight randomized control trials suggests no evidence of difference in short-term growth parameters between high and low MCT formula. Complete follow-up for the short-term growth parameters was well documented in all eight studies. Subgroup analyses according to percentage of MCT formula found no evidence of difference in weight gain in any subgroup. The infants in all the studies were healthy preterm infants. Several studies reported using only AGA participants, but <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1992</LINK> did include an unclear number of SGA infants. Other studies may also have included SGA infants as they did not specify. Inclusion of SGA infants may affect results on weight gain as SGA infants have been found to regain birth weight faster than comparable AGA babies (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Data on adverse effects were limited and mostly descriptive in nature. There was no evidence of difference in the incidence of NEC, but an effect may not have been detected given the small numbers of infants enrolled. Although there was no statistically significant difference with either stool transit time or fecal output, there were trends toward higher stool output and faster transit time in the low MCT formula groups. These trends, however, are probably not clinically significant. Furthermore, there does seem to be conflicting evidence regarding tolerance between <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> who found evidence of intolerance for high MCT as opposed to <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK> who found no difference.</P>
<P>Other clinically important outcomes such as neurodevelopmental outcomes or long-term growth were not able to be evaluated due to the lack of data on these outcomes. The planned subgroup analysis of weight gain by birth weight was not able to be done. Birth weights were reported individually in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>), but not individual weight gain. Effect on poor growth, less than the intrauterine rate of 15 g/kg/d, was also not able to be evaluated since all included trials report mean weight gain above 15 g/kg/d.</P>
<P>All of the eight included trials reported randomized allocation, but none described the sequence generation methods. Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Huston-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>) described allocation concealment which in both cases was by use of opaque, sealed envelopes. In addition, many of the included trials referred to blinding, but did not explain explicitly the methods of blinding or whether intervention or outcome assessment or both were blinded. Although this might not affect objective measures like weight gain to a significant degree, it potentially may have a large impact on clinical ascertainment of tolerance (as one possible explanation for the difference between <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>). Another methodology issue was the cross over design utilized by several of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamosh-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Hamosh 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1986</LINK>). Those trials have the potential for the "wash-in/out" phenomenon as they did not explicitly describe a wash-out period between the first and second exposure periods.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity of treatment effect in any of the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>This review has several major limitations. One limitation is that all eight included trials had very small numbers of infants. The small study populations are evidenced by the wide confidence intervals. Such small numbers may not allow high enough power to detect differences in, for example, NEC incidence. Another issue is that the decision to only include studies in English may result in study selection bias and further restrict numbers of infants included.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence of difference between high and low MCT formula on short-term growth, gastrointestinal intolerance, or NEC incidence. The small number of trials, each containing a small study population, may be responsible for the lack of evidence of difference.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research is needed concerning the effect of high vs. low MCT formula on short and long-term growth parameters and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. In addition, future research needs to assess effects on weight gain in different birth weight categories. Further studies which carefully blind outcome assessment and interventions are needed to evaluate gastrointestinal intolerance. Trials enrolling larger numbers of preterm infants would improve power to detect differences in NEC incidence or differences in growth rates.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>43% MCT (n=15), 30% MCT (n=14), 17% MCT (n=15), 5% MCT (n=16). Balance studies x2d when first 9-12 infants per formula had reached at least 100 kcal/kg/d. Mean duration of study period 18-22d, but mean time in study on full feeds was one week (7.0+/-0, 5%MCT; 6.8+/-0.1, 17%MCT; 6.6+/-0.2, 30%MCT; 6.9+/-0.1d, 43%MCT).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Short term growth, GI intolerance (ie. emesis), fat absorption, ketogenesis (or the presence of ketone bodies), serum glucose and carnitine levels.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Data on growth not reported in a form which permits use in meta-analysis in this review. Carnitine and taurine added to all formulas. Infants only received a formula diet, but parenteral nutrition not mentioned. Since randomized prior to enteral feeds, assumed no use of any human milk in diet. 4 infants left study unrelated to formula intolerance. 2 of 60 did have formula intolerance (1 from 5%MCT with sepsis and NEC, 1 from 17% MCT with abdominal distension and aspirates).</P>
