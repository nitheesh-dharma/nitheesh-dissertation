<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-06-04 07:20:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know if people suspected to have inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) due to infection with the meningococcal bacteria should be given antibiotics before the diagnosis is confirmed in order to prevent death or disability. We found one relevant study.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Meningococcal disease is a rapidly progressing, contagious bacterial infection that can cause epidemics of severe disease of the brain and blood. If not treated early many will die or have permanent disabilities. Antibiotics are very effective if given early. Waiting for confirmation of the diagnosis with laboratory tests can result in delays in starting antibiotics. Giving antibiotics early based on a clinical suspicion (empiric treatment) could prevent delays in treatment and consequent death and disability. However, doing so could also result in unnecessary treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies comparing giving versus not giving empiric antibiotics or comparing different antibiotics in those with suspected meningococcal disease. We found one randomised trial comparing single intramuscular doses of two different long-acting antibiotics. The evidence is current to January 2017.</P>
<P>The included study was conducted in nine primary care facilities in Niger during an outbreak of meningococcal disease in 2003. Of 510 adults and children studied, 251 received ceftriaxone and 259 received chloramphenicol. The study was funded by Médecins Sans Frontières.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>There was no difference in the number of people who died, did not respond to treatment, or with neurological disabilities with either antibiotic empirically. The results were similar in whom the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed. Neither antibiotic had significant adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Although the study was well conducted, the overall quality of the evidence was only moderate for death and treatment failures because the study excluded children less than two months old, pregnant women, and the severely ill. The quality of evidence was lower for neurological disabilities because of the shortness of follow-up.</P>
<P>Since meningococcal disease has serious consequences, not giving antibiotics empirically would be unethical. However, future research comparing different antibiotics in people of all ages and illness severity is required to provide reliable evidence in different clinical settings.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-02 05:30:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (6 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 6 January 2017), Embase (1980 to 6 January 2017), Web of Science (1985 to 6 January 2017), LILACS (1982 to 6 January 2017), and prospective trial registries to January 2017.

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the search results. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-08 09:47:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no RCTs comparing pre-admission antibiotics versus no pre-admission antibiotics or placebo. We included one open-label, non-inferiority RCT with 510 participants, conducted during an epidemic in Niger, evaluating a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone versus a single dose of intramuscular long-acting (oily) chloramphenicol. Ceftriaxone was not inferior to chloramphenicol in reducing mortality (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.56; N = 503; 308 confirmed meningococcal meningitis; 26 deaths; moderate-quality evidence), clinical failures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.15; N = 477; 18 clinical failures; moderate-quality evidence), or neurological sequelae (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.62; N = 477; 29 with sequelae; low-quality evidence). No adverse effects of treatment were reported. Estimated treatment costs were similar. No data were available on disease burden due to sequelae.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-08 09:47:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no reliable evidence to support the use pre-admission antibiotics for suspected cases of non-severe meningococcal disease. Moderate-quality evidence from one RCT indicated that single intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone and long-acting chloramphenicol were equally effective, safe, and economical in reducing serious outcomes. The choice between these antibiotics should be based on affordability, availability, and patterns of antibiotic resistance.</P>
<P>Further RCTs comparing different pre-admission antibiotics, accompanied by intensive supportive measures, are ethically justified in people with less severe illness, and are needed to provide reliable evidence in different clinical settings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-08 09:47:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008, Issue 1 and updated in 2011 and 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2013</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-08 09:47:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meningococcal disease is a contagious bacterial disease caused by <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>. <I>N meningitidis</I> strains are classified primarily into serogroups based on the type of polysaccharide capsule expressed. While 13 serogroups have been described (A, B, C, D, 29E, H, I, K, L, Y, W-135, X, and Z), most of the disease is caused by strains belonging to serogroups A, B, C, X, Y, and W-135 (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>). Serogroups B and C account for most of the cases in Europe and the Americas (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Tawfiq-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Tawfiq 2010</LINK>). Serogroups A and C are responsible for most of the cases in Asia and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 2010</LINK>). In the African 'meningitis belt' that extends from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in the west, newer strains of serogroup A meningococcal disease have occurred in epidemic form that have posed a recurrent threat to public health, and rates of meningococcal disease in this region are several times higher than in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a systematic review of 132 studies published between 1980 to 2008 that reported on the incidence of disabling sequelae of bacterial meningitis in 18,183 adult and child survivors of bacterial meningitis, <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type b (Hib) was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis (35.5%), with pneumococcus accounting for 19.6%, meningococcus for 16.4% and other pathogens for 12% (<LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>). However, the relative frequency of disease caused by <I>N meningitidis</I> has increased in recent years due to the widespread and successful use of an effective vaccine for <I>H influenzae</I> B and a conjugate vaccine for <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>, leaving <I>N meningitidis</I> as the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, particularly in some parts of Africa where surveys indicate that <I>N meningitidis</I> was responsible for 60% to 70% of cases of meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Meningococcal disease is most common in children (due to waning maternal antibody levels), adolescents, and young adults (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Up to 5% to 10% of a population may be asymptomatic carriers of <I>N meningitidis</I>, in whom the bacteria are harmless commensals of the nasopharyngeal mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Meningococcal disease is caused by a combination of bacterial virulence factors (particularly the ability to express capsules) and host susceptibility, including age, prior viral infection, overcrowding, smoking, co-infections, and genetic polymorphisms (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>). Meningococcal disease is spread by person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets from infected people. Meningococcal disease attack rates can be as high as 100 to 800 cases per 100,000 but individual communities have on occasion reported rates as high as 1000 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). In 1996, the largest outbreak ever reported occurred in the meningitis belt, in which the total number of cases was over 250,000 with 25,000 reported deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>The onset of symptoms of meningococcal disease is sudden, and death can follow within hours (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>). It is estimated that around 50,000 people, mostly children and young adults, die every year from among the approximately 500,000 cases of meningococcal disease reported annually (<LINK REF="REF-Granoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granoff 2009</LINK>). Case fatality rates from invasive meningococcal disease are usually in the range of 10% to 15%, but mortality rates depend on the type and severity of invasive disease, and are greatest in people with meningococcaemia, fulminant septicaemia and shock (50% to 60%), followed by those with meningitis and associated septicaemia (up to 25%), and are lowest for meningitis without sepsis (less than 5%) (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meningococcal disease differs from other gram-negative bacterial infections by the release of lipopolysaccharide endotoxins and vesicles that cause rapidly progressing skin haemorrhage and necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock (<LINK REF="REF-Brandtzaeg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandtzaeg 2005</LINK>). Other meningococcal virulence factors have been identified such as capsular polysaccharides (serogroups A, B, C, W-135, Y, and X) and a number of surface-expressed adhesive proteins, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Opa, and Opc, that contribute to the ability to avoid innate immune responses and which aid adherence to mucosal surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouphael-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouphael 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>). Capsules of <I>N meningitidis</I> help with transmission and colonisation, and the ability to express and modify capsule is associated with its epidemic potential (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequelae</HEADING>
<P>There is significant resultant morbidity in 10% to 15% of survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Baraff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraff 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>); from reports published between 1988 to 2008, the pooled median risk (and interquartile range) of developing at least one major sequela after hospital discharge in people with invasive meningococcal disease was 7.2% (4.3% to 11.2%) (<LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>). The risk of major sequelae is greatest in the African and Southeast Asian regions and in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramakrishnan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakrishnan 2009</LINK>). Major sequelae are permanent neurological defects caused by pathophysiological inflammatory responses during infections. These involve increased blood-brain barrier permeability; a large compartmentalised inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space, with pronounced increase in concentrations of tumour necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukins, chemokines and other mediators; and increased resistance to the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid and oedema of the brain leading to elevated intracranial pressure and alterations in cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tunkel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunkel 1993</LINK>). The alteration in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is caused in part by inflammatory mediators such as matrix metalloproteinases (particularly MMP-8), leading to disassembly of brain microvascular endothelial cell junction components and cell adhesion during meningococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Schubert_x002d_Unkmeir-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubert-Unkmeir 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The resultant neurological deficits include hearing loss or deafness (most common), vision defects, speech disorders, amputation of limbs or digits and scarring of skin (due to extensive necrosis), hydrocephalus, mental retardation, spasticity, paralysis, and seizures, and present a long-term and serious challenge for families with limited means to care for a disabled child, especially in resource-poor settings (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramakrishnan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakrishnan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Prevalence estimates of these sequelae do not account for the increased mortality or social drift further down the socio-economic ladder in those with such disabilities, particularly in low-income families and in resource-poor settings, leading to underestimates of prevalence in surveys of postmeningitis sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>). Even in high-income countries, impaired cognitive functions and behavioural sequelae result in impairments in many areas of social, educational, occupational functioning and quality of life after bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>These estimates of the sequelae of invasive meningococcal disease also do not account for deaths that might have occurred before admission to hospital due to difficulties in establishing a clinical diagnosis, lack of clinical suspicion in areas not prone to epidemics, and delays in instituting effective treatment in areas with health systems unable to respond to these needs. Meningococcal disease has many clinical manifestations and is often difficult to differentiate from common, less serious illnesses. The infectious syndromes associated with meningococcaemia include meningitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, epiglottitis, otitis, and focal diseases such as urethritis, conjunctivitis, arthritis, and pericarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>). Clinical suspicion of meningococcal infection may vary with the geographic locale of the study, the age group of the patients being studied (children or adults), and the criteria used for clinical diagnosis of meningococcal disease. Meningococcal disease is suspected when there is a characteristic skin rash, headache, weakness, fever, vomiting, and depressed sensorium, with or without evidence of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harnden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harnden 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The definitive diagnosis of meningococcal infection requires isolation of <I>N meningitidis</I> (a gram-negative intracellular diplococcus that ferments glucose and maltose) from a sterile body fluid such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or synovial, pleural, or pericardial fluids. In meningococcal meningitis, sterilisation of the CSF occurs rapidly (within two hours) after the instigation of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Kanegaye-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanegaye 2001</LINK>). Culture confirmation occurs in only a third of clinically diagnosed cases, yet meningococcal DNA can be detected in 88% of admission blood samples from the same patients, and molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the CSF are informative, even after starting antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2002</LINK>). Polymerase chain reaction of the blood is highly specific for <I>N meningitidis</I>, can be used for subgroup and serotyping, and may even be of prognostic significance; quantitative PCR reveals higher bacterial DNA load to be associated with greater severity of illness and greater risk of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-El-Bashir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Bashir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2002</LINK>). Polymerase chain reaction is more sensitive than culture, particularly in the context of pre-admission treatment. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommends that blood real-time PCR should be done to confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal disease, and that CSF should also be submitted for PCR if the CSF culture is negative (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). However, these techniques may not be readily available in resource-poor settings.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-02 13:57:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of antibiotics has dramatically reduced mortality due to meningococcal disease. Once diagnosis is confirmed, crystalline penicillin is commonly given intravenously every 4 to 6 hours for 7 to 10 days in individuals not at risk of anaphylaxis. Rates of bacterial penicillin resistance vary. In areas where penicillin resistance predominates, third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines, <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>, and the NICE guidelines, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>, respectively. However, quinolones are not approved for routine paediatric usage and ceftriaxone requires parenteral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Girgis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girgis 1998</LINK>). Sulphonamides are now rarely used, as intermediate resistance to these drugs is reported in some areas (<LINK REF="REF-Eickhoff-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eickhoff 1965</LINK>). Oral macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotics are also effective in treating invasive meningococcal disease and averting mortality, though their routine use in suspected cases of invasive meningococcal disease may depend on 'indication bias' (bias in initiating oral versus parenteral or no antibiotics due to perceptions of mild to moderate, as opposed to severe, illness severity) (<LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>). A Cochrane review studied osmotic agents for bacterial meningitis and found no benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Wall-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wall 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The efficacy of short courses of ceftriaxone and oily chloramphenicol has been demonstrated in the treatment of meningococcal meningitis in adults (<LINK REF="REF-El-Filali-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Filali 1993</LINK>). In one epidemic, a single intramuscular injection of an oily suspension of long-acting chloramphenicol proved as effective as a five-day course of crystalline penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>). Chloramphenicol is bactericidal for <I>N meningitidis</I> and penetrates the blood-brain barrier more effectively than beta-lactam antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Pecoul-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pecoul 1991</LINK>). Intravenous cefotaxime plus either ampicillin or amoxacillin is recommended in children under three years of age (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, often combined with vancomycin, are also used in high-income countries until the causative agent has been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>). A systematic review did not reveal important differences between third-generation cephalosporins or conventional antibiotics in averting death or deafness in people with bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P>A recent Cochrane review found that rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, or penicillin are effective for prophylaxis, with rifampicin resistance being an issue, as mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-Zalmanovici-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zalmanovici 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-02 14:04:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of pre-admission antibiotic therapy is to reduce the risk of serious disease by preventing delays in starting therapy. This delay may occur if confirmation of meningococcus is sought before initiation of therapy. It is believed that if treatment is begun early, the associated severe complications and mortality may be avoided or minimised by preventing or reducing the effects of the systemic inflammatory response of the body, including reduced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and endotoxin production; and also lead to a reduction in bacterial proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Brandtzaeg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandtzaeg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanegaye-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanegaye 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2000</LINK>). Preventing meningococcal shock is dependent on reducing endotoxin levels and meningococcal bacterial load (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2002</LINK>), and given that meningococcaemia is a rapidly progressive disease, with an estimated doubling time of meningococci of 30 to 40 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>), the time available for early administration of antibiotics is limited.</P>
<P>With this in mind, the concept of empiric antibiotic use based on clinical suspicion, before a confirmed bacteriological diagnosis is made, or the 'pre-admission' use of antibiotics prescribed or administered by the doctor in first contact with the patient, has been found to be effective in reducing mortality and complications due to meningococcal disease in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strang-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2000</LINK>). </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-02 14:09:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard policy in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>), backed by recommendations from professional associations, mandates the initiation of antibiotics, particularly penicillin, once criteria for bacterial meningitis are met. Some policies contend that initiating antibiotic therapy requires the prior collection of CSF for bacterial confirmation or the use of PCR of the CSF, though there is a lack of consensus on the need for confirmation of the diagnosis before starting antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>). The NICE guideline states that children with suspected meningitis and meningococcal disease should have a lumbar puncture unless specifically contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, it is not clear whether treating all suspected cases is associated with improved outcomes, since the effects of confounding are difficult to interpret in the observational studies supporting this view (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harnden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harnden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In previous versions of this review we identified no trials comparing pre-admission antibiotics to no antibiotic prior to confirmation of meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudarsanam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudarsanam 2013</LINK>). We identified one trial that demonstrated the non-inferiority of a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone versus a single dose of intramuscular long-acting (oily) chloramphenicol in reducing serious outcomes.</P>

<P>Our protocol predefined participants as those with suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis awaiting transfer to hospital and randomised to treatment before confirmation of diagnosis. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>, funded by Médecins Sans Frontières, was conducted between March and April 2003 in Niger, during an epidemic of meningococcal infection, and recruited people with suspected meningococcal meningitis from one of eight peripheral health centres, as well from a regional hospital at Zinder, Niger.</P>
<P>Clarifications from the trial authors revealed that anyone presenting with suspected meningitis to any site included in the study, who met the inclusion criteria, was invited to participate. If informed consent was obtained, a lumbar puncture was conducted (along with a rapid diagnostic test for malaria), and the participant was then randomised to the interventions. Participants remained at the site to which they had initially presented (and had received the intervention) for a minimum of 72 hours of follow-up. If a second treatment dose was required, or if an alternative treatment was necessary, these too were administered at the original site. No transfer of participants between sites occurred. Of the 510 participants originally included in the study, 97 (19%) were recruited at the National Hospital in Zinder and 41 (8%) at a district hospital in Matameye. The trial authors clarified that the hospital in Matameye was a hospital by name, but had no medical facilities beyond those of the other health centres. The remaining 372 (73%) were treated in peripheral health centres.</P>
<P>We felt that as 81% of participants were treated in what were effectively peripheral health centres, and since participants were randomised to the interventions before confirmation of diagnosis, the data from this trial could be used without biasing our review's stated objectives.</P>
<P>The sample size in this trial was chosen to show non-inferiority between the two groups (less than 10% difference in the failure rate between the two groups at 72 hours) for the primary outcome of treatment failure (death at 72 hours or clinical failure). Most participants (~55% to 57%) were in the five-to-14-years age group, with 31% under the age of five years but greater than two months old. The trial evaluated the effects of a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) and a single dose of oily chloramphenicol (long-acting intramuscular chloramphenicol) in people suspected of having meningococcal disease.

<P>Data were only available for short-term outcomes, as defined in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> section. At 72 hours, deaths occurred in 14 out of 247 (6%) participants in the ceftriaxone arm and 12 out of 256 (5%) participants in the long-acting chloramphenicol arm (ITT values from the report). Mortality did not differ significantly between the two interventions (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.56; N = 503; moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). A subgroup analysis of the participants who were later confirmed to have meningococcal disease also failed to show any difference in mortality between the two study arms (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.56; N = 308). Mortality did not differ in the remaining 195 participants in the intervention arms without confirmed meningococcal meningitis (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.76). We did not undertake formal tests for subgroup differences since the confidence intervals for subgroup effects overlapped considerably.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Lack of clinical improvement</HEADING>
<P>This composite outcome was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 11 at 24 hours or less than 13 at 48 hours; no improvement or worsening in the state of consciousness or neurological status; persistent convulsions; and axillary temperature above 38.5° C. The ITT analysis reported that clinical failure occurred in 8 out of 233 (3%) participants in the ceftriaxone arm and 8 out of 244 (4%) participants in the long-acting chloramphenicol arm. Again, this difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.15; N = 477; moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The interventions did not differ in the proportions of those with clinical failure in the 308 confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 8.47), nor in the 169 participants in whom meningococcal meningitis was not confirmed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.58).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pre-admission antibiotics versus no antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>Our primary question regarding the efficacy and safety of pre-admission antibiotics in decreasing mortality or morbidity in people with suspected meningococcal disease remains unanswered, since we did not find any RCTs comparing antibiotics versus placebo or no antibiotic in suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis and the initiation of antibiotics in the control group after confirmation of the diagnosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus long-acting chloramphenicol</HEADING>
<P>The sole eligible RCT included in this review reported that a single dose of ceftriaxone was not inferior to long-acting chloramphenicol in preventing mortality, neurological sequelae, the need for a second injection, and clinical non-response (in the first 48 hours after admission), in those with suspected, and those subsequently confirmed, to have meningococcal meningitis who were given the antibiotic at presentation to the healthcare facility during an epidemic of meningitis (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>). No adverse events were reported for either drug, and costs were comparable.</P>
<P>The trial excluded very ill participants (people in an unresponsive coma and in shock), thus leaving unanswered the question of the efficacy of the schedule of treatments in such instances and the role of supportive measures, even if antibiotics were to be given early. Even among those with a less severe illness at the start of the trial, treatment failure at 72 hours and death were significantly more likely in those with impaired consciousness prior to admission (univariate odds ratio 5.51, 95% CI 2.90 to 10.45). This suggests that a single dose of antibiotics prior to admission may be insufficient to prevent negative outcomes in some people with moderately severe illness, perhaps due to suboptimal dosage, the toxic effects of rapid bacteriolysis, or the absence of adequate additional interventions to combat or prevent haemodynamic imbalance, respiratory distress, renal insufficiency, dehydration or overhydration, and electrolyte imbalance (<LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2006</LINK>). These speculations are borne out by experiences with intensive treatment of meningococcal disease elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Booy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booy 2001</LINK>), though the speculation on the toxic effects of rapid bacteriolysis due to antibiotic treatment have not been borne out uniformly by empiric enquiry (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>We found no reliable evidence on the relative efficacy of giving antibiotics before confirmation of the diagnosis or withholding them until confirmation of the diagnosis.</P>
<P>We believe that we have identified all trials relevant to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK> provided moderate-quality evidence to endorse the use of a single dose of either ceftriaxone or oily chloramphenicol in reducing mortality, though the short follow-up precludes the drawing of valid conclusions regarding neurological sequelae.</P>
<P>The external validity of this trial is less clear. When generalising the results to settings and periods other than during epidemics, as in this trial, it is uncertain whether similar mortality and morbidity estimates would be achieved in the absence of high levels of treatment-seeking and alertness to the possibility of meningococcal meningitis that epidemics engender.</P>
<P>The oily suspension of chloramphenicol is ideal for use in low-income countries, due to the comparable efficacy of a single intramuscular dose, repeated if needed after 48 hours, to 10 days of intravenous ampicillin given four times a day (<LINK REF="STD-Pecoul-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pecoul 1991</LINK>), achieved at a 10th of the cost. Widespread resistance to chloramphenicol in high-income countries limits its usefulness in these settings. However, long-acting chloramphenicol may be a useful drug of choice in low-income countries where resistance to chloramphenicol is not a major problem and if supply is not compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Pecoul-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecoul 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ceftriaxone was initially around six to 10 times more expensive than long-acting chloramphenicol, but patent rights for ceftriaxone have expired in most countries, and the generic drug costs have also fallen (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>). Given the comparative efficacy and costs of both agents evaluated in the included trial, the choice of drug for initial pre-admission antibiotic therapy would depend on the proportion of people with chloramphenicol resistance among the population in question, and the affordability of ceftriaxone at local costs. When antibiotic susceptibility testing is limited in low-income countries with emerging chloramphenicol resistance, oily chloramphenicol as the initial drug followed by ceftriaxone, if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours and bacterial meningitis is confirmed, is a possible strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Duke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duke 2003</LINK>). Ceftriaxone could be used as the first-line drug in the presence of widespread chloramphenicol resistance, though the emergence of resistance to ceftriaxone could also result if this use was indiscriminate. Ceftriaxone would also be preferable to chloramphenicol in situations where the suspected case of meningococcal meningitis is caused by <I>H influenzae</I> or <I>S pneumoniae</I>, where chloramphenicol is not as effective.</P>
<P>The other factor that would influence the choice of antibiotic is safety. Both drugs were considered safe in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>Additional caveats must be considered before instituting pre-admission antibiotics in areas with and without epidemic meningitis. One is the need to rule out other common infections with similar presentations, such as malaria, and meningitis due to other infective pathogens. The alarm engendered by epidemics or local outbreaks may also result in the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. In the included trial malaria was diagnosed in 44 (9%) of participants, and three cases of meningitis were due to <I>H influenzae</I> and three to <I>S pneumoniae</I>; moreover 133 (23%) had sterile lumbar punctures (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>The other caveat is that unless early initiation of antibiotics in suspected cases of meningococcal disease is accompanied by other measures to improve healthcare delivery (increased recognition and case detection, early transfer to hospital and facilities, and the rapid initiation of supportive measures to manage complications of the more severe forms of the illness), the benefits of antibiotics alone are unlikely to affect mortality rates significantly (<LINK REF="REF-Booy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design and quality of reporting</HEADING>
<P>The included trial was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of ceftriaxone to chloramphenicol, assuming 15% of those allocated to chloramphenicol would be treatment failures, a difference of less than 10% between the interventions, a one-sided 5% significance level, 80% power, and 10% loss to follow-up. The trial authors stated that they calculated the risk difference and 90% CIs of the primary and secondary outcomes and considered the difference as equivalent if the upper limit of its 90% CI was below 10%.</P>
<P>Non-inferiority trials present particular difficulties in design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation, as do trials assessing equivalence. True equivalence is difficult to prove, but the assumption of equivalence in this instance was based on the demonstration of non-inferiority initially, using one-sided 5% significance and a one-sided 90% CI. Equivalence was then assessed using a pre-stated one-sided 90% CI of less than 10% (a two-sided CI might have been more appropriate) and an ITT analysis. The design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation of this trial conformed to the recommendations in the extension to the CONSORT statement for non-inferiority and equivalence trials (<LINK REF="REF-Piaggio-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piaggio 2006</LINK>). We considered the study to be adequate in reporting randomisation, allocation concealment, and attrition, and although it was an open-label trial, we considered the risk of detection bias to be low due to the objective outcomes used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>We rated the overall quality of the evidence for primary outcomes as moderate, and although there were no limitations in study design, we downgraded the trial for indirectness for all outcomes due to the exclusion of infants, pregnant women, and those with severe disease (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We further downgraded the quality of the evidence to low for neurological outcomes since the duration of follow-up was only 72 hours and was deemed too short to adequately detect neurological outcomes. Trials that assess deficits in the longer term would enable the detection of neurological sequelae that are detected only after discharge, particularly hearing deficits and spasticity in young children, and milder cognitive deficits and behavioural changes in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>). The methods used to detect these outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK> were based on gross clinical evaluation and may also have been insensitive to detect them accurately.</P>
<P>The trial may also have been underpowered to demonstrate non-inferiority for neurological outcomes in confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis, and the follow-up was too short, therefore we judged the quality of the evidence for this subgroup as very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-04 07:45:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the importance of the issue, the surprising lack of RCTs for our main objective is worrying. While it may suggest that we were unable to locate small trials, particularly those with inconclusive results, and indicate publication or retrieval bias, our search of multiple sources with no language restrictions reassures us that this is unlikely. A more credible explanation is that pre-admission antibiotics have become the standard of care in many countries and hence an RCT, especially a placebo-controlled trial, may be deemed unethical.</P>
<P>At first reading, the sole included trial seemed to not fulfil our inclusion criteria of 'pre-admission' use of antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>), since participants were those treated in health centres; written communication with trial authors confirmed that the first dose of antibiotic was administered to people suspected as having meningococcal meningitis prior to seeking confirmation of the diagnosis. The trial authors also clarified that the majority of the treatment facilities (8/9) were primary care centres, and the majority of participants were treated at these centres (81%). The results of this trial also showed that 195/503 (39%) randomised participants were not subsequently confirmed to have meningococcal meningitis on culture or by polymerase chain reaction, attesting to the actual use of antibiotics prior to disease confirmation and the suitability of this trial for inclusion in this review. None of the excluded RCTs fulfilled this definition of antibiotic use.</P>

Considering the non-specific nature of symptoms, especially in milder cases and in young children, and the lack of sensitivity of the specific clinical signs of both Kernig and Brudzinski, in adults as well as in children (<LINK REF="REF-El-Bashir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Bashir 2003</LINK>), it is likely that data from these sources are confounded by diagnostic errors and inclusion of the more severely ill (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harnden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harnden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1998</LINK>). The latter are more likely to seek help in clinic-based studies, be perceived to have meningitis by clinicians in these and in community-based studies, and to be treated with parenteral antibiotics early, leading to 'indication bias' (<LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>). Consequently, the often paradoxical outcomes of these observational studies, both positive and negative, are confounded by disease severity, and the proportions that received pre-admission antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harnden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harnden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perera 2006</LINK>). Similarly, observational studies of oral pre-admission antibiotics that report lower mortality and morbidity are also confounded by indication bias, in this case the inclusion of people with less severe or non-meningococcal disease (<LINK REF="STD-Harnden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harnden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A retrospective analysis of 848 people admitted with invasive meningococcal disease, 49 of whom died (6%), from 1995 to 2000 in 31 hospitals in Spain, used the 'propensity score' to assign patients the probability of receiving pre-hospital antibiotics prior to admission, based on clinical symptoms, and matched the 228 who had received oral antibiotics in the 48 hours prior to admission with controls who had not received pre-hospital antibiotics, again based on their propensity scores for not being thus treated (<LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>). Adjusted multivariate analyses indicated that pre-hospital antibiotics appeared to protect against death (odds ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.93). The propensity score technique has been equated with randomisation in situations where randomisation is difficult, and this trial attempted to adjust for the indication bias that has confounded interpretation of previous observational studies. The imprecision of the effect estimate (the confidence intervals suggest a protective effect that could be clinically very important to only marginally important) is in concordance with evidence from case-control studies that indicate, on balance, that early diagnosis, early admission to hospital (within three hours), and early initiation of supportive measures are as important as the early commencement of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pre-admission cephalosporins versus chloramphenicol</HEADING>
<P>Previous NICE guidance recommended that children with suspected meningococcal disease be given parenteral antibiotics (benzylpenicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin) at the earliest opportunity (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). The SIGN guideline on the management of invasive meningococcal disease in children and young people recommends that parenteral antibiotics (benzylpenicillin or cefotaxime) should be given as soon as invasive meningococcal disease is suspected and even before confirmation of the diagnosis is sought (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>). The latest NICE guidance considers transfer to hospital and fluid management of greater priority than administering pre-hospital antibiotics, unless immediate transfer is not possible, or if the clinical suspicion of meningococcal meningitis is accompanied by a non-blanching rash or meningococcal septicaemia (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). In contrast to earlier guidance, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK> recommends using ceftriaxone as first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis and meningococcal disease in children and young people older than three months of age.</P>
<P>An economic analysis, done from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and a socialised medicine approach, strongly suggests that ceftriaxone is the most cost-effective antibiotic for the treatment of suspected meningococcal disease or suspected meningitis in a majority of children (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). This concurs with the cruder estimates in <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>. The NICE analyses did not take into account variations in drug prices or any effects on health or costs arising from antibiotic resistance, both of which may vary widely in different settings. These estimates also assumed that survival is the only health-related quality of life outcome of importance with antibiotic use and did not consider other outcomes such as prevention of neurological disability and its (more difficult to estimate) consequences and associated costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost or gained.</P>

<P>This review update again found no trials to provide reliable evidence to support or refute the routine use of pre-admission antibiotics for suspected cases of meningococcal disease.</P>
<P>The decision to start antibiotics before admission or confirmation of the diagnosis will therefore depend on local health policy. Considering the potential for serious outcomes and rapid evolution of the disease, the routine use of antibiotics when meningococcus meningitis is suspected appears to be supported by the balance of evidence from available observational studies, which suggest that early intervention, coupled with intensive support measures, are beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in people suspected to have meningococcal meningitis, and particularly meningococcal septicaemia.</P>
<P>When symptoms are milder, false-positive diagnoses are more likely and close monitoring and investigations to confirm suspicions, and investigations to rule out other infections, are especially warranted.</P>
<P>If antibiotics are given before confirmation of the diagnosis, the benefits may outweigh the risks inherent in their use, though this needs to be reviewed on an individual basis. Limited data from the one randomised controlled trial reviewed here, which excluded infants, pregnant women, and those with severe illness, suggest that pre-admission antibiotics in people suspected to have meningococcal meningitis are more likely to prevent unfavourable outcomes if initiated before the onset of frequent seizures or impaired consciousness, or in the absence of concurrent infections. Early antibiotic treatment should be accompanied by better healthcare delivery that facilitates more rapid and accurate diagnosis, rapid transfer to hospital, and the immediate initiation of intensive supportive measures.</P>
<P>While penicillin is commonly recommended as a pre-admission antibiotic, we found no trials of penicillin for this indication. In the sole trial of pre-admission antibiotics for meningococcal meningitis identified in this review, single intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone and long-acting chloramphenicol (with an additional dose in 24 to 48 hours, if clinical recovery was poor) were equally effective and safe in reducing mortality and morbidity in suspected and confirmed cases. Ceftriaxone may also be the cheaper alternative to penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-08 09:47:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meningococcal disease has serious consequences and progresses rapidly in a sizeable proportion of patients. Standard policy in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn_x00e9_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahné 2006</LINK>), backed by recommendations from professional associations (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>), mandates the early initiation of antibiotics, particularly penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin, once criteria for bacterial meningitis are met.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that randomised, placebo-controlled trials will be conducted to answer the primary question on the efficacy and safety of initiating early antibiotic treatment versus delaying antibiotics until confirmation of the diagnosis in suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis, to prevent deaths and neurological or other disabling or disfiguring sequelae.</P>
<P>More accurate and early diagnosis would aid the early and appropriate use of antibiotics. Dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) using outer membrane complexes from <I>Neisseria meningitidis B</I> as a target was found to be specific for serologic verification of clinically suspected meningococcal disease in patients; determination of antibody titres produced during different phases of natural infection was also possible (<LINK REF="REF-Belo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belo 2010</LINK>). The increased use of dip-stick rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which can be easily and accurately used by non-specialist healthcare personnel in basic healthcare facilities and which are comparable in diagnostic accuracy to polymerase chain reaction diagnosis, will obviate the need to wait until samples are confirmed in reference laboratories, and will aid the decision to institute life-saving measures early for those diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chanteau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanteau 2007</LINK>). The use of RDTs would also facilitate attempts to use scarce stocks of emergency vaccines more appropriately (<LINK REF="REF-Boisier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boisier 2009</LINK>). However, the sensitivity of RDTs would need to improve and large-scale production be stabilised to ensure less batch-to-batch variation than is currently observed (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2010</LINK>). Molecular testing of nasopharyngeal specimens using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the <I>ctrA</I> gene involved in <I>N meningitidis</I> capsular transport is a non-invasive near-patient diagnostic test that is being evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Bourke-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The need for placebo-controlled trials to guide decisions pertaining to the pre-hospital use of antibiotics will then have less urgency, due to the shorter times to confirmation of diagnoses.</P>
<P>However, randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of different pre-admission antibiotics, particularly in comparison with penicillin, are ethically justifiable and are needed to widen the evidence-base for antibiotics available to clinicians in settings of differing resistance patterns, drug costs, availability, and preferences.</P>
<P>Given that the majority of treatment failures and fatalities in many observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Edmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmond 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perea_x002d_Milla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perea-Milla 2009</LINK>), and in the sole randomised controlled trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>), occurred in those with more severe manifestations of the disease at presentation, the efficacy of immediate antibiotic use needs to be evaluated alongside other immediate measures to prevent death or clinical deterioration. <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK> excluded people with established evidence of serious illness pre-randomisation, severely ill people, and those in coma or shock. Including people with such characteristics in future trials may be ethically justified if coupled with measures for rapid confirmation of the diagnosis, and if other intensive supportive measures were also given to all participants, or were the focus of specific enquiry, when given along with pre-admission antibiotics.</P>
<P>Trials in those with less severe forms of illness are also both needed and ethically justified. An important issue is the potential for antibiotic resistance should antibiotics be indiscriminately used for this indication. Evidence for the efficacy of pre-confirmation antibiotic use is particularly important in those with suspected meningitis without indicators of severe disease, as many such cases could eventually be found not to be due to meningitis or due to other aetiologies. Such trials should be adequately powered to detect differences in outcomes between those with and without confirmed meningococcal meningitis, and could stratify participants by levels of severity.</P>
<P>However, uncertainties in the speed of, and variations in, disease evolution, and the problems of identifying an ideal threshold of clinical symptoms and signs for inclusion in such trials, given the problems with sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnostic criteria (unless replaced or supplemented by molecular or dip-stick rapid diagnostic tests), would pose ethical and logistical problems in the implementation and interpretation of such trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2010 update</HEADING>
<P>Since the first publication of this review, newer methods were introduced with the release of RevMan 5.3 and were incorporated with this update (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). These include a more detailed description of methods, such as the 'Risk of bias' assessment and the 'Summary of findings' tables. These also encouraged the implementation of other changes during this update to better evaluate the outcomes in the context of potential biases and confounders and other contextual factors that were not immediately apparent nor considered in the original review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For this update of the review, we also included the proportion of people with confirmed diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis among those randomised as subgroups in the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes. This omission was an oversight in the initial review, as such an analysis enables an exploration of the efficacy of pre-admission antibiotics in confirmed meningococcal meningitis versus that due to other organisms such as <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>or <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>, or in those participants without a bacterial aetiology for their presenting symptoms<I>. </I>Since overall mortality is also of importance from a public health perspective in recommending particular antibiotics, and not just that due to meningococcal disease, we introduced this exploration to inform our conclusions better of their relative efficacy in the two subgroups.</P>
<P>In addition, comparisons of trials with short follow-up durations, as in the trial included in this review, and those that assess deficits in the longer term, if identified by future updates, would enable comparison of the development of neurological sequelae that are detected only after discharge, particularly hearing deficits and spasticity in young children and milder cognitive deficits and behavioural changes in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2009</LINK>), which may differ in those with meningitis due to meningococcus and those without.</P>
<P>We included the outcome of lack of clinical improvement as a subgroup for the same purpose in this update. We presented the results for this outcome in the previous version of this review, although this outcome had not been explicitly pre-stated in the protocol. Additional subgroups introduced were levels of severity and low-income versus moderate- to high-income settings, however no data were available for this review; both are factors that can impact the outcomes independent of the kind of antibiotic used prior to confirmation of the diagnosis.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we used the intention-to-treat data provided in the trial report and did not attribute a poor outcome to the seven dropouts in the first 72 hours after randomisation, as we had done in the first version, since it did not seem reasonable to do so. The results were only marginally different between the two approaches.</P>
<P>We also included the economic costs provided in the report for this update, which had not be used in the original review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Methods</HEADING>
<P>We expanded on the sections describing methods for dealing with missing data and unit of analysis issues and, as stated above, subgroup analyses and explorations of heterogeneity. We added a section on summarising findings.</P>
<P>While these were done after knowledge of the results of <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2005</LINK>, they were necessitated by the newer methods incorporated with RevMan 5.3 and will better inform interpretation of results and conclusions, should future updates include additional trials (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also note that many of the subgroup analyses we had planned in the methods section could not be carried out due to lack of data.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote: "Of the 557 patients screened, 510 were randomly assigned to receive ceftriaxone or chloramphenicol. Of these individuals, 47 (9%) were excluded because they were ineligible and another seven (1%) were lost to follow-up after treatment allocation"</P>
<P>Comment: 4/251 in the ceftriaxone arm and 3/259 in the chloramphenicol arm who left the facility before 72 hours were not included in the intention-to-treat analysis by the trial authors. The review authors feel this is a reasonable way to explain these dropouts for the primary outcomes of this review. The original version of this review used a revised intention-to-treat analysis of these dropouts considering them to have had the worst outcome for primary and secondary outcomes; the results of the 2 analyses did not significantly differ.</P>
<P>Comment: 160/247 in the ceftriaxone arm and 148/256 in the chloramphenicol arm who were included in the intention-to-treat analyses were confirmed to have meningococcal meningitis and were included in the per-protocol analysis. The remaining 87 and 108 participants in the respective arms did not have the suspected diagnosis confirmed. The differences in confirmed cases for primary and secondary outcomes excluded clinically and statistically important differences between interventions.</P>
<P>Quote: "Patients in clinical failure at 72 h were followed through to complete recovery. Although the risk of relapse after discharge was regarded as low and all patients were advised to return to the clinic in the event of clinical deterioration, no patients returned during the study period."</P>
<P>Comment: Unlikely to introduce bias as both drugs were associated with very low relapse rates in other observational studies done in the region with longer follow-up periods</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>Basis of the assumed risk: control group risk.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Effect estimate: consistent with non-inferiority of ceftriaxone versus chloramphenicol.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious study limitations: block randomised using off-site computer-generated codes in blocks of 20; allocation concealed in numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; recruitment was by personnel not involved in generating random sequence; baseline variables matched in intervention arms; open-label trial but outcome was objective; outcomes completely and adequately reported; no other biases.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious inconsistency: results for all participants and in subgroups were consistent.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Serious imprecision: sample size was estimated to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary outcome and not for neurological sequelae (secondary outcome). A sample size of 175 individuals with confirmed meningococcal meningitis per group (350 total) was needed for the primary outcome with a one-sided 5% significance level, 80% power, and assuming 10% dropouts. Only 308 participants were confirmed to have meningococcal meningitis, thus trial may be underpowered to detect non-inferiority for neurological outcomes. Downgraded by one.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>No serious imprecision: trial was adequately powered to demonstrate non-inferiority. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Publication bias unlikely: search for trials was comprehensive. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Parallel-group, open-label, non-inferiority trial.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Serious indirectness: trial excluded infants, pregnant women, and those with serious illness (in non-reactive coma or with convulsions). Downgraded by one.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Clinical failure: composite of: a) state of consciousness remaining severely altered (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 11 at 24 hours or &lt; 13 at 48 hours); b) no improvement in the state of consciousness since 0 hour; c) appearance of or worsened neurological symptoms since 0 hour; d) repeated or persistent convulsions; and e) axillary temperature above 38.5° C in the absence of other evident infectious pathological changes.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Neurological sequelae: judged on gross clinical abnormality.<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP>Serious indirectness: follow-up was too short to detect neurological sequelae adequately. Downgraded by one.<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP>No serious imprecision: sample size of 350 required to demonstrate non-inferiority for primary outcome, but sample size adequately powered to demonstrate non-inferiority for this secondary outcome as well. Not downgraded.</P>
