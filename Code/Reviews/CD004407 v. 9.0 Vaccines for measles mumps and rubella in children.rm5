<TITLE>Using the combined vaccine for protection of children against measles, mumps and rubella</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-19 07:40:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are three very dangerous infectious diseases which cause severe morbidity, disability and death in low-income countries.</P>
<P>Based on the evidence provided by three cohort studies (3104 participants), vaccination with one dose of MMR vaccine is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles among preschool children; in schoolchildren and adolescents at least one dose of MMR vaccine was 98% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed measles cases; one or two MMR doses were respectively 92% and 95% effective in preventing secondary measles cases.</P>
<P>At least one dose of MMR vaccine is effective in preventing clinical mumps among children and adolescents when prepared with Jeryl Lynn strains (vaccine effectiveness = 69% to 81%, one cohort and one case-control study, 1656 participants), as well as when prepared with Urabe strain (vaccine effectiveness = 70% to 75%, one cohort and one case-control study, 1964 participants). Effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed mumps in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one and 83% to 88% for two doses of Jeryl Lynn MMR (two case-control studies, 1664 participants) and 87% for Urabe-containing MMR (one cohort study, 48 participants). Vaccination with Urabe MMR confers protection against secondary mumps infection (vaccine effectiveness = 73%, one cohort study, 147 participants).</P>
<P>We identified no studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR vaccine against clinical or laboratory-confirmed rubella.</P>
<P>Results from two very large case series studies involving about 1,500,000 children who were given the MMR vaccine containing Urabe or Leningrad-Zagreb strains show this vaccine to be associated with aseptic meningitis; whereas administration of the vaccine containing Moraten, Jeryl Lynn, Wistar RA, RIT 4385 strains is associated with febrile convulsion in children aged below five years (one person-time cohort study, 537,171 participants; two self controlled case series studies, 1001 participants). The MMR vaccine could also be associated with idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (two case-controls, 2450 participants, one self controlled case series, 63 participants).</P>
<P>We could assess no significant association between MMR immunisation and the following conditions: autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, or bacterial or viral infections. The methodological quality of many of the included studies made it difficult to generalise their results.</P>

<P>Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.</P>

<P>For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-20 09:33:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-18 02:50:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.</P>
<P>Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.</P>
<P>The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-04 10:37:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.</P>

<P>Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illnesses, disabilities and death. MMR are particularly prevalent in low-income countries where vaccination programmes are inconsistent and the mortality rate from disease is high. However, in high-income countries MMR are now rare, due to large-scale vaccination programmes.</P>

<P>The single component live attenuated vaccines of MMR have been licensed in the USA since the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Plotkin-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotkin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plotkin-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotkin 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redd 1999</LINK>). These single vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality rates associated with these childhood illnesses.</P>
<P>At least five MMR vaccines are known.</P>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-12-18 02:55:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No national health policy recommends that the MMR vaccine be given as three separate vaccines. Combined live attenuated MMR vaccine was introduced in the USA in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Redd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redd 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1975</LINK>). MMR is included in the World Health Organization's <I>Expanded Programme on Immunisation</I> and it is used in over 50 European countries, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; in total, over 90 countries around the world use the MMR vaccine. Accepted recommendations are that the first dose should be administered on or after the first birthday and the second dose of MMR at least 28 days later. In many European countries the second dose is administered at four to 10 years of age. Vaccination with MMR provides significant improvement in the efficiency of paediatric immunisation through the administration of three vaccines in a single injection, which is important in reducing costs while increasing immunisation coverage against the three diseases (<LINK REF="STD-Makino-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 1990</LINK>). The incidence of MMR worldwide has been significantly reduced by MMR vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single-component measles vaccine (MV) is actually used in nearly all African WHO member states (44 out of 47 states); in the main cases vaccination schedules prescribe a single-dose administration at nine months of age. In only four African countries (Algeria, Lesotho, Republic of South Africa, Swaziland) a second MV dose is administered at 18 months or at six years of age (Algeria) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The administration of the first dose of measles-containing vaccine at nine months of age is recommended in countries with ongoing transmission and with high risk of measles mortality among infants, in order to ensure adequate protection. The introduction of a second measles-containing vaccine dose to the immunisation schedule is recommended only when a coverage of at least 80% for the first dose of measles-containing vaccine has been reached for three consecutive years. It should be administered at 15 to 18 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Altogether, besides 44 African WHO member countries, an additional 24 countries have exclusively used MV in their vaccination schedule (among others the Russian Federation). Eleven countries have a single-dose MV administration at nine months of age (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Djibouti, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Nepal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste, Vanuatu and Vietnam).</P>
<P>The capability of MMR mass immunisation to eliminate the targeted disease has been demonstrated in a number of countries. The USA is the largest country to have ended endemic measles transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Strebel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strebel 2004</LINK>), with interruption of indigenous transmission in 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1998</LINK>). In Finland, a national programme launched in 1982 reached measles elimination in 1996 and in 1999 the country was documented as free of indigenous mumps and rubella (<LINK REF="REF-Peltola-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 2000</LINK>). These experiences demonstrate the possibility of achieving interruption of transmission in large geographic areas and suggest the feasibility of global eradication of measles. Therefore, it would be ethically unacceptable to conduct placebo-controlled trials to assess vaccine effects. Current research on the effectiveness of MMR vaccines focuses on comparison of vaccine strains and optimising protection by modifying the immunisation schedules; these topics are outside the scope of the present review.</P>
<P>A retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Kreidl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreidl 2003</LINK>) reported data about MMR vaccination coverage for local areas in South Tyrol (North-East Italy) and reported cases of measles in the same areas. In all areas with complete vaccination coverage below 50%, an incidence of at least 333 cases per 100,000 was observed; whereas a very low incidence of the disease was registered in those areas where the highest immunisation coverage was achieved, despite their higher population density.</P>
<P>After the introduction of MMR vaccine in England in October 1988, the annual incidence of mumps declined sharply. The annual incidence rate fell from 160/100,000 in 1989 to 17/100,000 in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Gay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gay 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>One retrospective observational study, which seemed to show an unexpectedly low clinical effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Vandermeulen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandermeulen 2004</LINK>) was carried out on 1825 children aged between 15 months and 11 years. It examined the incidence of mumps in seven kindergartens and primary schools in Belgium during a mumps outbreak. This was assessed using questionnaires completed by parents and following evaluation of the reported data according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1997</LINK>) case definition. On average, 91.8% of the children had received at least one dose of MMR vaccine at any time before the outbreak occurred. In this group (N = 1641) mumps was diagnosed in 85 children whereas 20 out of the 139 non-immunised children developed mumps (45 children from both groups were excluded from the analysis because they had a history of mumps prior to the outbreak).</P>
<P>The components of monovalent vaccine containing MMR viruses, and subsequently combined MMR vaccine, are described below (<LINK REF="STD-Makino-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plotkin-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotkin 1999b</LINK>). Numerous attenuated measles vaccines, mostly derived from the Edmonston strain, are currently produced worldwide. Four vaccines containing non-Edmonston derived strains are also in use, including Leningrad-16, Shanghai-191, CAM-70 and TD97. In most cases the virus is cultured in chick embryo cells. However, a few vaccines are attenuated in human diploid cells. The majority of vaccines contain small doses of antibiotics (for example 25 µg of neomycin per dose) but some do not. Sorbitol and gelatin are used as stabilisers (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>More than 10 mumps vaccine strains (Jeryl Lynn, Urabe, Hoshino, Rubini, Leningrad-3, L-Zagreb, Miyahara, Torii, NK M-46, S-12 and RIT 4385) have been used throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Redd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redd 1999</LINK>). Most vaccines also contain neomycin (25 µg of per dose). The Jeryl Lynn strain is widely used. Several manufacturers in Japan and Europe produce a live mumps vaccine containing the Urabe Am9 virus strain. Concerns about vaccine-associated meningitis have prompted some countries to stop using MMR with the mumps Urabe strain. Often the viruses are cultured in chick embryo fibroblasts (as with the Jeryl Lynn and Urabe strain-containing vaccines) but quail and human embryo fibroblasts are also used for some vaccines.</P>
<P>Most rubella vaccines used throughout the world contain the RA 27/3 virus strain (<LINK REF="REF-Plotkin-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotkin 1965</LINK>). The only exceptions are vaccines produced in Japan which use different virus strains: Matsuba, DCRB 19, Takahashi and TO- 336 are all produced using rabbit kidney cells; and Matsuura is produced using quail embryo fibroblasts. The RA 27/3 strain is used most often because of consistent immunogenicity, induction of resistance to re-infection and its low rate of side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Plotkin-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotkin 1973</LINK>).

<P>Three review authors (AR, MGD, CDP) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.

We assessed the quality of non-RCTs in relation to the presence of potential confounders which could make interpretation of the results difficult. However, because there was insufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of the non-randomised quality assessment screens, these studies were used for the purposes of qualitative analysis only.</P>
<P>We evaluated the quality of case-control (prospective and retrospective) and cohort studies using the appropriate Newcastle-Ottawa Scales (NOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>). We applied quality control assessment grids, based on those developed by The University of York, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2001</LINK>), to historical controlled trials (HCTs), interrupted time-series and case cross-over studies and ecological studies (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). We used a classification and methodological quality checklist (unpublished) for case-only design studies, especially developed by CP Farrington and TO Jefferson and adapted from a paper by CP Farrington (<LINK REF="REF-Farrington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrington 2004</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Makela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 2002</LINK> was weakened by the loss of 14% of the original birth cohorts and the effects of the rather long-term follow-up. What the impact of either of these factors was in terms of confounders is open to debate. It should be taken into account that autism does not often involve hospitalisation and data about outpatients visits were not available. The long follow-up for autism could be due to the lack of a properly constructed causal hypothesis. Again, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1999</LINK> demonstrates the difficulties of drawing inferences in the absence of a non-exposed population or a clearly defined causal hypothesis. The exclusive use of discharge diagnoses for identification of cases in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2007</LINK> could have introduced a noteworthy selection bias.</P>

<P>One cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Marolla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marolla 1998</LINK>) evaluated the effectiveness of MMR vaccination in preventing clinical cases of measles in children aged 18 to 90 months from several local health agencies in Rome, Italy (n = 2745). Vaccination was performed with three different commercial MMR vaccines, two containing both Schwarz strain (Pluserix and Morupar) and one other prepared with Edmonston-Zagreb strain (Triviraten). Vaccines effectiveness was calculated by using the following formula [1-(measles incidence among vaccinated/measles incidence among unvaccinated) x 100]. Effectiveness (one dose) was estimated to be 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88 to 99) in the Morupar study arm, whereas no measles cases were found among Pluserix recipients.

<LINK REF="STD-Makela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 2002</LINK> was based on a surveillance study by the National Public Health Institute that began after the introduction of MMR vaccination in Finland for children aged 14 to 18 months and six years (1982). Participants aged one to seven years (n = 535,544) who received the MMR II vaccine between November 1982 and June 1986 were considered in the study (this population corresponds to 86% of all children scheduled for MMR vaccination in Finland).

For evaluation of long-term prognosis, the number of recurrent episodes of febrile seizure and the cases of epilepsy observed in children who received MMR vaccination within 14 days before their first febrile seizure episode and in those who were vaccinated more than 14 days before their first febrile seizure episode, were compared with those who were not vaccinated at the time of their first febrile seizure episode.

Fourteen out of the 387 cases and 27 out of the 1924 controls received the MMR vaccine within six weeks before hospitalisation (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, adjusted for age and use of drugs by multiple logistic regression).<BR/>

<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-France-2008" TYPE="STUDY">France 2008</LINK> is based on data contained in the Vaccines Safety Datalink project for the years 1991 to 2000, covering eight managed care organisations (MCO) across the USA. By consulting the database, 63 cases aged 12 to 23 months who met the definition (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>) could be identified. The 42 days following immunisation was considered as the exposed period, whereas the time before and after this was considered the not exposed period, with the exclusion of a six-week time interval before vaccination. Twenty cases had been classified as exposed and 43 as not exposed. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the exposed and unexposed time was calculated by using two different analytical methods: the self controlled case series (SCCS) and the "risk interval" (i.e. person-time cohort) method. By the SCCS method, conditional Poisson regression was used to calculate the IRR, controlled by age and excluding fixed covariate from the model (gender, MCO, MMR dose number). By the "risk interval" method, the Poisson regression model controlled for age, MMR dose number, MCO site and gender was used to calculate IRR. Estimates were respectively 5.38 (95% CI 2.72 to 10.62) and 3.94 (95% CI 2.01 to 7.69). Considering the analysis included only children aged 12 to 15 months (the age at which about 80% of MMR vaccinations were administered), the IRR estimates were 7.06 (95% CI 1.95 to 25.88) and 7.10 (95% CI 2.03 to 25.03) for SCCS and "risk time", respectively. The attributable risk was estimated to be about 1 ITP case per 40,000 administered MMR doses.</P>

<P>The evidence of association between MMR, or any of its component vaccines, and the onset of thrombocytopenic purpura (TP) was also assessed in one ecological study (<LINK REF="STD-Jonville_x002d_Bera-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jonville-Bera 1996</LINK>). The study concluded that the evidence favoured an association but in all cases TP appeared to be a benign, self limiting condition not distinguishable from its idiopathic counterpart or from TP occurring after natural infection with measles, mumps or rubella. The study discussed the weakness of relying on the passive reporting system for the identification of cases and acknowledged a possible under-reporting of cases of TP.</P>

<P>Three retrospective cohort studies investigated the risk of autism and pervasive development disorders (PDD) following MMR immunisation (<LINK REF="STD-Fombonne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fombonne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uchiyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Uchiyama 2007</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2002</LINK> was conducted in Denmark and included all Danish children born between January 1991 and December 1998. The authors linked vaccination data reported in the National Board of Health with a diagnosis of autism (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>) from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. After adjustment for confounders, the RR for autism is 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.24) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.07) for other autistic spectrum disorders. No association between age at vaccination, time since vaccination or date of vaccination and development of autism was found.</P>
<P>The retrospective cohort study by <LINK REF="STD-Fombonne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fombonne 2001</LINK> tested several causal hypotheses and mechanisms of association between exposure to MMR vaccination and pervasive development disorders (PDDs, <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). The population was made up of three cohorts of participants; one was of older children acting as the control (pre-MMR vaccination introduction). The authors concluded that there was no evidence that PDDs had become more frequent, the mean age at parental concern had not moved closer to the date of exposure to MMR vaccination, there was no evidence that regression with autism had become more common, parents of autistic children with regression did not become concerned about their child in a different time frame from that of children without regression and children with regressive autism did not have different profiles or severity to those in the control group. Nor was there evidence that regressive autism was associated with inflammatory bowel disorders.</P>
<P>The retrospective cohort study by <LINK REF="STD-Uchiyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Uchiyama 2007</LINK> assessed the association between exposure to MMR vaccination and regression in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Participants were children with an ASD diagnosis (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>) from a private paediatric psychiatric clinic located in Yokohama city, Japan (Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic, YPCD), that has become recognised as a centre for ASD. For study purposes, cases of ASD in patients born between 1976 and 1999 were considered (n = 904). They were classified according to the chance of having received the MMR vaccine as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pre-MMR vaccine generation: born between January 1976 and December 1984, n = 113.</LI>
<LI>MMR vaccine generation: born between January 1985 and December 1991, n = 292.</LI>
<LI>Post&#8211;MMR vaccine generation with an age of one to three years old after 1993 when the MMR vaccination programme was terminated, n = 499.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For 325 out of the 904 identified ASD cases, a regression in ASD could be assessed. Data were analysed in different ways.</P>
<P>Within the MMR vaccine generation group, OR estimates were calculated considering the cases of deterioration observed in children who received the MMR vaccine from the MCH handbook (15/54) and the number of regression observed among participants who did not receive the MMR vaccine (45/132), after exclusion of those with unknown vaccination status (89). Authors reported an OR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.52, P = 0.49) in patients who received the MMR vaccine versus no MMR vaccination in the MMR period.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the OR estimate was calculated considering as the control group (not MMR vaccinated) also both pre- and post-MMR generation groups. Estimates were again not significant (OR 0.626; 95% CI 0.323 to 1.200). Comparison of regression cases observed within the MMR generation group (independent from documented vaccination status) with that observed in pre-MMR, post-MMR and pre- plus post-MMR groups did not provide statistically significant OR estimates.</P>

<P>The risk of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism was investigated in three case-control studies (<LINK REF="STD-DeStefano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DeStefano 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mrozek_x002d_Budzyn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mrozek-Budzyn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2004</LINK> assessed the association between exposure to the MMR vaccine and the onset of autism and other PDDs (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). The study was based on data from the UK's General Practice Research Database (GPRD) which was set up on 1 June 1987. The authors concluded that their study added to the evidence that MMR vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of PDDs. The OR for the association between MMR vaccination and PDDs was 0.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.97) for the non-practice matched control group and 0.86 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.09) for the practice matched control group. The findings were similar when analysis was restricted to children with a diagnosis of autism only, to MMR vaccination before their third birthday, or to the period prior to media coverage of the hypothesis linking MMR vaccination with autism.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-DeStefano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DeStefano 2004</LINK> compared the distribution of ages at first MMR vaccination in children with autism (cases, <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>) and controls, divided into three age strata: up to 18, 24 and 36 months. The authors concluded that there was no significant difference between cases and controls in the age at first vaccination up to 18 months (adjusted OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.38) and 24 months (adjusted OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.67); but more cases received MMR vaccination before 36 months (adjusted OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.36; unadjusted OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.14), possibly reflecting the immunisation needs of children in a surveillance programme.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mrozek_x002d_Budzyn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mrozek-Budzyn 2010</LINK> cases of autism in children aged between two and 15 years were identified by means of general practitioners' records from Ma&#322;opolska Province in southern Poland (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). For each case, two controls matching for birth year, gender and practice were selected. A total of 92 cases with childhood or atypical autism and 192 matched controls were included. Estimate OR were calculated considering vaccine exposure (MMR or monovalent measles) before autism diagnosis or before symptoms onset separately in univariate and multivariate analysis (this latter balanced for mother age &#8805; 35 years, gestation time &#8804; 38 weeks, medication during pregnancy, perinatal injuries and five-minute Apgar score). In multivariate analysis, administration of MMR vaccine before the diagnosis was associated with a relevant reduced risk of autism (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.52; P = 0.002); this association was not confirmed when exposure before symptom onset was considered (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.16). Risk of autism was significantly lower for MMR vaccinated children when compared with children immunised with single component measles vaccine, both before diagnosis (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) and symptom onset (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.91).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fombonne-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fombonne 2006</LINK> analysed the trend of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) prevalence in cohorts born from 1987 to 1998 attending a school board in the south and west parts of Montreal (n = 27,749 on 1 October 2003). The relationship between PDD prevalence trends and MMR vaccination coverage through each birth cohort was assessed. Children with PDDs (n = 180) were identified from a special list that was filled with data of children identified by code 51 (autism) and by code 50 (autism spectrum disorder) to allow the schools to receive incremental funding. The authors reported that while a significant trend toward a decrease in MMR uptake through birth cohorts from 1988 to 1998 (<I>X</I>
<SUP>2 </SUP>for trend = 80.7; <I>df </I>= 1; P &lt; 0.001) could be assessed, a significant increase in rates of PDDs from 1987 to 1998 was found (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.16; P &lt; 0.001). By comparing the rate of increase in PDDs prevalence between the one-dose and two-dose period, no statistically significant differences were detected.</P>
<P>A Japanese study (<LINK REF="STD-Honda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Honda 2005</LINK>) assessed the trend of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) incidence among birth cohorts from 1988 to 1996 (Yokohama city, Central Japan) up to seven years of age, in relation to the decline of MMR vaccination coverage in the same birth cohorts, i.e. before and after termination of MMR vaccination programmes in children (1993). Through examination of risk factor analysis with conditional regression, a significant increase in cumulative incidence of all ASDs through birth cohorts from 1988 to 1996 has been observed (<I>&#967;<SUP>2</SUP>
</I> = 45.17, df = 8, P &lt; 0.0001). This trend was different before and after the 1992 birth cohort: considering the 1996 birth cohort as a reference, incidence of all ASDs was significantly lower until 1992 and was not different after 1993. A significant increased incidence could be assessed also when outcomes definition of childhood autism (<I>&#967;<SUP>2</SUP> </I>= 31.86, df = 8, P &lt; 0.0001) or other ASD (<I>&#967;<SUP>2</SUP>
</I> = 19.25, df = 8, P = 0.01) were considered. The authors concluded that causal hypothesis involving the MMR vaccine as a risk factor was not supported by the evidence because the ASD incidence continued to increase even if the MMR vaccination programme was terminated.</P>

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Makela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 2002</LINK>, already described in the section relative to neurological diseases (see above), an attempt to evaluate the association between MMR vaccination and hospitalisation for autism was made (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). Unlike encephalitis and aseptic meningitis, instead of a risk period, changes in the overall number of hospitalisations for autism after MMR vaccination, including only the first hospital visit during the study period, were considered. Times between immunisation and hospitalisation observed among the 309 hospitalisations for autism following MMR immunisation were very wide (range three days to 12 years and five months), their numbers remained relatively steady during the first three years and then decreased gradually. No cluster intervals from vaccination could be identified. Authors concluded that there was no evidence of association, but did not report statistical data supporting this conclusion.</P>
<P>One other self controlled case series study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1999</LINK>) assessed clustering of cases of autism by post-exposure periods in a cohort of 498 (with 293 confirmed cases) children.

<P>The cohort study by <LINK REF="STD-McKeever-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McKeever 2004</LINK> used an historical birth cohort of children (1988 to 1999) consisting of 29,238 children of both sexes aged between 0 and 11 years and identified through the West Midlands General Practice Research Database (GPRD), to investigate the association between MMR and diphtheria, polio, pertussis and tetanus (DPPT) vaccination and asthma or eczema (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>). Incident diagnoses of asthma/wheeze and eczema (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>) were identified using the relevant Oxford Medical Information System (OMIS, derived from ICD-8) and Read codes (a hierarchical code used in GP practices in England). Association with MMR vaccine exposure and risk of asthma and eczema has been assessed by univariate analysis. Correspondent crude hazard ratios (HR) were 3.51 (95% CI 2.42 to 5.11) and 4.61 (95% CI 3.15 to 6.74) for asthma and eczema, respectively. Stratifying for GP consultation frequency in the first 18 months, HR estimates remain significant only for the subgroup with lower consulting frequency (zero to six times in the first 18 months) and not for the other subgroups (seven to 10 times, 11 to 16 times and more than 16 times): HR 7.18 (95% CI 2.95 to 17.49) for association between MMR vaccination and asthma; HR 10.4 (95% CI 4.61 to 23.29) for association between MMR vaccination and eczema, respectively.</P>
<P>One other cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-DeStefano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeStefano 2002</LINK>) used data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project in order to detect a possible association between asthma and some infant vaccines, among which was MMR (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>). For the study, a population of children who were enrolled in four Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) from birth until at least 18 months of age (to a maximum of six years) between 1991 and 1997 was considered (n = 167,240). Asthma cases (n = 18,407) were identified by reviewing computerised databases maintained at each HMO (see <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK> for case definition). Ascertainment of vaccine exposure was performed by using computerised immunisation tracking systems maintained by each of the HMOs. Out of the 167,240 included participants 12,426 were not immunised with the MMR vaccine. Proportional hazard regression does not show a significant association between asthma and MMR vaccination (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Person-time cohort studies</HEADING>
<P>Association between asthma hospitalisation, anti-asthma medications (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>) and MMR vaccine exposure was tested on Danish birth cohorts from 1991 to 2003 in the <LINK REF="STD-Hviid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hviid 2008</LINK> study, by using the Danish Civil Registration System. Each participant recorded in the register had an identification number, that allowed a link to data contained in other national registers (Danish National Hospital Register, Danish Prescription Drug Database and National Board of Health). MMR vaccination status was considered as a time-varying variable and individuals could contribute to person-time as both unvaccinated and vaccinated participants. MMR vaccination is protective against all asthma hospitalisation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.78); the protective effect of vaccination was greater in younger children (no more significant when the vaccine was administered after 18 months of age), in those with the longest time spent at the hospital (18 days to one year), in girls, in low birth-weight children, in children with one older sibling and in those living in rural areas. The vaccination was also protective against hospitalisation for severe asthma (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82), even if estimates were not significant within the following stratifications: age three or four years; fully immunised children; low hospitalisation propensity; male sex; birth weight below 2499 g or above 4000 g; birth order &gt;/= three; birth in the capital or in a rural area. Total use of anti-asthma medications was less frequent among participants immunised with MMR (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.92). No reduction in use (all medications) was observed for participants vaccinated at ages between 23 and 26 months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01) or at 27 months or later (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03). Considering single classes of medication in the unstratified study population, these data were confirmed with the exception for systemic b2-agonists, for which reduction in use could not be observed (RR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02). Considering only the first use of any anti-asthma medication in the unstratified population, the RR was 0.93; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.94.</P>

Analyses had been carried out for both total leukaemia cases and control (323 and 409, respectively) and for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) subset (282 cases and 360 controls). Considering leukaemia as case definition, OR estimates for any MMR dose before the reference date in all populations was 1.06 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.63).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bremner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bremner 2005</LINK> focused particular attention on the timing of MMR vaccination to identify a critical period for MMR immunisation and hay fever risk (see <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> for definition). The nested case-control study was conducted within two large databases, the General Practice Database (GPRD) and Doctors&#8217; Independent Network (DIN) and involved 7098 hay fever cases and controls. After performing a conditional logistic regression the authors reported that infants who received MMR vaccination did not have a greater or lesser risk of developing hay fever than unvaccinated children. MMR unvaccinated children compared with vaccinated in month 14 (base group) had an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.08).

The risk of later hay fever following exposure to MMR vaccine within the first grass pollen season of life was not statistically different from that observed when MMR administration occurred outside of it (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; P = 0.38).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hviid-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hviid 2004</LINK> was a retrospective cohort study carried out in Denmark aiming to evaluate if there was an association between childhood vaccinations and the onset of type 1 diabetes. A cohort of children born from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2000 from the Danish Civil Registration System was individuated. The Danish Civil Registration System identified with a unique number all people living in Denmark. This number made it possible to obtain linked information on vaccination, diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>), the presence or absence of siblings with type 1 diabetes and potential confounding factors. The vaccination data were obtained from the National Board of Health, where the General Practitioners reported data.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gait disturbance</HEADING>
<P>Association between MMR vaccination and gait disturbance was assessed by means of a self controlled case series study (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>) and considered as cases hospital admissions or general practice consultations in children within the Thames regions of England. Hospital admission cases were obtained from hospital computerised records for the period April 1995 to June 2001, considered those relative to children aged 12 to 24 months with ICD-10 diagnoses related to acute gait disorder (G111, G112, G25, R26, R27, R29, H55 and F984). Cases were validated by reviewing hospital case notes and grouped into five categories (<LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK>). Vaccination history of cases was obtained from immunisation records. In all, 127 cases with available immunisation status were identified. Out of these, 65 belonged to category 4 (i.e. non-ataxic, non-viral origin) and were excluded from analysis. No cases corresponding to category 1 definition were found. Relative incidence (RI) within and outside post-vaccination time risk (0 to 30 and 31 to 60 days) was calculated after age stratification in one-month intervals. RI estimates for pooled two, three and five categories were not statistically relevant (RI 0.83; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.84 for 0 to 30 days risk time and RI 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.47 for 31 to 60 days risk time).</P>
<P>As gait disturbance does not require hospitalisation, authors carried out a further analysis based on cases observed in General Practices using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) as the source, and considered children aged 12 to 24 months, born between 1988 and 1997. Read and OXMIS codes indicating a possible consult for gait disturbance were identified in GPRD by mapping ICD-9 codes and by searching keywords 'ataxia', 'gait', 'co-ordination', 'mobility' and 'movement'. Diagnoses were grouped into six categories (<LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK>). Vaccination history was obtained from prescription records. In all, 1398 children with diagnoses A-F and known immunisation history were included. Since, in the authors' opinion, a vaccine-specific effect would appear one week after immunisation (an excess of B and C diagnoses was observed on vaccination day) the risk period zero to day five was separately considered. In any other considered risk periods (six to 30, 31 to 60 and six to 60 days after MMR immunisation) RI did not have a statistically relevant increased incidence. Early administration of thiomersal-containing DTP/DT vaccine did not influence this estimate.</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seagroatt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seagroatt 2005</LINK>) considered the hypothesis of an association between MMR vaccination and Crohn's disease (CD) or inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK>).</P>
<P>One case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>) was conducted in the United States using data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to evaluate if MMR and measles-containing vaccines increased the risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Medical records were reviewed and cases were classified according to the type of disease (CD, ulcerative colitis/proctitis or IBD). The authors concluded that exposure to the MMR vaccine was not associated with an increase risk of CD (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.0), ulcerative colitis (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.56) and all IBD (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.69).</P>
<P>One ecological study (<LINK REF="STD-Seagroatt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seagroatt 2005</LINK>) investigated a possible association between the MMR vaccine and CD. Using English national data on emergency admissions, the authors compared admissions for CD in populations with a vaccination coverage of &#8805; 84% with populations with a MMR vaccination coverage of &#8805; 7%. The estimated rate ratio for the MMR vaccination programme was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.08). Even if age-specific rates of emergency admission for CD increased during the time considered in the study (April 1991 to March 2003), this trend seems not to have been influenced by the introduction of the MMR vaccine. The introduction of the MMR vaccination programme in England did not increase the risk of CD.</P>

<P>The possible association between the MMR vaccine and demyelinating diseases was assessed in two studies, using the same population data set.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlgren-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlgren 2009a</LINK> is a cohort study carried out in the Gothenburg area (Swedish west coast, 731,592 residents on 31 December 2000). Cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) in participants born between 1959 and 1990 with onset at ages between 10 and 39 years before July 1984 among Gothenburg residents were considered, corresponding to a total of 5.9 million person-years of observation (<LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK>). The incidence of probable or definite MS (Poser criteria) and CIS (372 and 162 cases, respectively) was analysed in corresponding measles, mumps and rubella vaccination programmes, by selecting four birth cohorts corresponding to the first years of a specific vaccination programme.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Birth cohorts 1962 to 1966 (102 MS cases): administration of the monovalent rubella vaccine to 12-year old girls in 1974.</LI>
<LI>Birth cohorts 1970 to 1973 (62 MS cases): administration of the MMR vaccine at 12 years of age (1982).</LI>
<LI>Birth cohorts 1974 to 1978 (37 MS cases): administration of monovalent measles vaccine in pre-school children. (It was already introduced in 1971, thus adequate coverage was reached only for those born in 1974 and onwards). About 90% of subjects from these birth cohorts received the MMR vaccine at 12 years of age.</LI>
<LI>Born between July 1981 and June 1984 (five MS cases): administration of the MMR vaccine at 18 months and at 12 years of age.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The incidence of MS and CIS within each birth cohort was compared to that calculated for the preceding ones, including that of 1959 to 1961, corresponding to the pre-vaccine era. No significant changes in age and gender-specific incidence of MS between selected and preceding selected cohorts has been observed.</P>
<P>Authors use the same population incidence data in order to assess an association between MMR exposure and MS onset by means of a case-control design (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlgren-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlgren 2009b</LINK>). Similar to the cohort study, case definitions included MS or CIS according to Poser's criteria, residence in Gothenburg, birth date between 1959 and 1986, and disease onset from the age of 10 years onwards. For analysis of vaccine exposure, only cases and controls who attended the sixth grade in school (12 years) within the study area, for whom CHSH records were available (206 cases and 888 controls) were included. Estimates (OR) were calculated by using a logistic model including sex and year of birth, using MMR vaccine exposure as a dependent variable. Exposure to the MMR vaccine (in all) was not statistically different among cases and controls (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.05).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bacterial and viral infections</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of viral and bacterial infection following MMR administration was investigated by means of a self controlled case series design by <LINK REF="STD-Stowe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stowe 2009</LINK>. Episodes of hospitalisation for bacterial or viral infections occurring in children aged between 12 and 23 months, were identified by consultation of computerised hospital admission records from North, East and South London, Essex, East Anglia, Sussex and Kent using ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes and covering the time between 1 April 1995 and 1 May 2005 (2077 admission in 2025 children).</P>
<P>Bacterial infections were characterised as lobar pneumonia or invasive bacterial infection, whereas those of viral aetiology were encephalitis/meningitis, herpes, pneumonia, varicella zoster or miscellaneous virus (<LINK REF="TBL-18" TYPE="TABLE">Table 18</LINK>). Admissions were linked to date of MMR (and meningococcal) immunisation resulting from records held on child health systems. 'At risk' time periods were considered the intervals of 0 to 30, 31 to 60 and 61 to 90 days after immunisation. Admissions for lobar pneumonia were less frequent in the time between 0 and 30 days after MMR immunisation (RI 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86) or during the 90 days following immunisation (RI 0.77; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.93). No significant differences were found comparing incidence of invasive bacterial diseases in risk periods with that of background period. Regarding viral infections, a significantly lower incidence of varicella zoster was assessed within 30 days after MMR immunisation (RI 0.58; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99). However, RI estimates were not statistically relevant for the 31 to 60, 61 to 90 and the whole 0 to 90 days risk periods. On the contrary, the risk of hospitalisation due to herpes infection was higher in the risk time interval between 31 and 60 days after MMR vaccine administration (RI 1.69; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.70) but this risk was not significant considering the other risk periods. Hospitalisation risk for encephalitis/meningitis, viral pneumonia and miscellaneous viral infections, did not reach statistical significance in any of the considered risk time intervals. No significant risk of both bacterial and viral infection has been detected following concomitant administration of MMR and meningococcal C vaccine.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-18 03:27:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MMR vaccination would be highly effective (&#8805; 95%) in preventing clinical measles cases in preschool children and estimates were similar for each of the two measles strains with which participants had been immunised (Schwarz or Edmonston-Zagreb, one cohort study, n = 2745). The MMR vaccine (unspecified composition) is also about 98% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed cases in children and adolescents (one cohort study, n = 184). Effectiveness in preventing secondary measles cases among household contacts was 92% for one and 95% for two vaccine doses (one cohort study, n = 175).</P>
<P>Effectiveness of at least one dose of a Jeryl Lynn-containing MMR vaccine in preventing clinical mumps cases in children and adolescents has been estimated between 69% and 81% (one cohort and one case-control study, n = 1656). Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses (two case-control studies, n = 1664). At least one dose of Urabe strain-containing MMR is 70% to 75% effective in preventing clinical mumps (one cohort and one case-control study, n = 1964) and 87% effective against laboratory-confirmed mumps (this last estimate was provided from only one small cohort study with high bias risk, n = 48). Vaccination with MMR prepared with Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases (one cohort study, n = 147). In any case, there was an acceptably high effectiveness of the vaccine prepared only with Urabe or Jeryl Lynn strain but not so for that containing Rubini strain.</P>
<P>We found no studies assessing effectiveness of MMR against rubella.</P>
<P>Association with aseptic meningitis is confirmed for MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains on the basis of two very large time-series studies with moderate risk of bias and carried out on about 1,500,000 children aged one to 11 years, assessing a significant increased risk in the time between one and 10 weeks after immunisation, peaking within the third or fifth week. Association was not significant for vaccines prepared with mumps Jeryl Lynn strains, as it results from one cohort and one self controlled case series studies.</P>
<P>Due to the results of a well conducted, very large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children between three months and five year of age, febrile seizure (as first or as recurrent episode) has been found to be associated with MMR vaccine (prepared with Moraten, Jeryl Lynn and Wistar RA) within two weeks after administration in preschool Danish children.</P>
<P>In children aged 12 to 23 months, association with febrile convulsion six to 11 days after immunisation, would have been assessed for MMR containing both Jeryl Lynn or RIT 4385 mumps strains in a self controlled case series study with moderate bias risk (n = 894).</P>
<P>Increased risk of severe illness with fever and convulsions in children aged 12 to 35 months within six to 11 days after MMR exposure was assessed in one further self controlled case series study in which the vaccine strain composition was not reported (n = 107).</P>
<P>Association with acute or idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura within six weeks from immunisation was assessed in four studies (two case-controls, n = 2450, one self controlled case series, n = 63) but vaccine composition was not described in any of the studies.</P>
<P>Based on the identified studies, no significant association could be assessed between MMR immunisation and the following conditions: autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-12-23 23:44:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>External validity of included studies was also low. Descriptions of the study populations, response rates (particularly in non-randomised studies), vaccine content and exposure (all important indicators of generalisability) were poorly and inconsistently reported. In addition, inadequate and inconsistent descriptions of reported outcomes (a well-known problem (<LINK REF="REF-Kohl-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohl 2001</LINK>)), variable observation periods and selective reporting of results contributed to our decision not to attempt pooling data by study design.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-12-16 20:35:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found problematic internal validity in some included studies and the biases present in the studies (selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting) influenced our confidence in their findings. The most common type of bias was selection bias. We analysed reasons presented by the papers to justify missing data. Despite accepting as 'adequate' explanations such as 'non-response to questionnaire' and 'medical records unavailable', not all reports offered adequate explanations for missing data.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-12-23 23:13:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are some weaknesses in our review. The age limit of participants, although substantially justified by public health concerns about the effects of vaccination on the developing child, did lead us to exclude some studies only on this basis. Additionally, the methodological quality tools used to assess the ecological, time-series and case-only designs have not to our knowledge been empirically tested. We believe this to have had minimal impact on our findings given the size and nature of the biases present in the design and reporting of the included studies.</P>
<P>The range of differing study designs used by authors is partly a reflection on the lack of control children not exposed to MMR, due to the population nature of vaccination programmes. As MMR vaccine is universally recommended, recent studies are constrained by the lack of a non-exposed control group. This is a methodologically difficulty which is likely to be encountered in all comparative studies of established childhood vaccines. We were unable to include a majority of the retrieved studies because a comparable, clearly-defined control group or risk period was not available. The exclusion may be a limitation of our review or may reflect a more fundamental methodological dilemma: how to carry out meaningful studies in the absence of a representative population not exposed to a vaccine that is universally used in public health programmes. Whichever view is chosen, we believe that meaningful inferences from individual studies lacking a non-exposed control group are difficult to make.</P>
<P>The hypothesis that secondary vaccine failure (waning immunity) could occur and increase over the years after the last immunisation, has been considered in some studies but it needs to be better elucidated. Two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Briss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hersh-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersh 1991</LINK>) carried out in the USA during mumps epidemics on high school student populations having high vaccination coverage (over 97% received at least one mumps-containing vaccine dose before the outbreak), showed that risk of acquiring mumps was higher in participants who were vaccinated at least three (<LINK REF="REF-Briss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 1994</LINK>) or five years (<LINK REF="REF-Hersh-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersh 1991</LINK>) before the outbreak, than in those who were more recently vaccinated, thus this estimate was not statistically relevant. Linear regression analysis demonstrated no significant trend for increasing mumps attack rates by years, since last vaccination neither after one nor after two mumps-containing vaccine doses (<LINK REF="STD-Schaffzin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffzin 2007</LINK>). A Belgian study carried out on pupils from seven kindergartens and primary schools in Bruges city (age range three to 12 years) during a mumps epidemic in 1995 to 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Vandermeulen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandermeulen 2004</LINK>) estimated that odds of developing mumps increased 27% per one-year increase, from one year after the last MMR immunisation onwards. A case-cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Cortese-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortese 2008</LINK>) carried out at a University in Kansas (USA) during the 2006 outbreak showed that case patients were more likely than their roommates without mumps to have received the second MMR dose more than 10 years before (odds ratio (OR) 2.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 5.00). Waning immunity may be secondary to a lack of natural exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Cortese-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortese 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dayan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dayan 2008a</LINK>). The group with the highest mumps incidence during the 2006 outbreak in the USA were college-age youths (18 to 24 years) born during the 1980s, when the spread of mumps was so low that many of them were never exposed to the disease. They probably received a second dose in the early 1990s, when opportunities for booster shots against exposure to wild viruses became increasingly rare (<LINK REF="STD-Dayan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dayan 2008a</LINK>). Moreover, the risk of the contracting mumps virus from abroad should be considered, because in several countries, mumps vaccination was not routinely administered (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dayan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dayan 2008a</LINK>). Apart from waning immunity it must be taken in account that mumps strains used in vaccine preparation differed phylogenically from those isolated during recent mumps outbreaks (<LINK REF="STD-Dayan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dayan 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dayan-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayan 2008b</LINK>). These facts could explain, at least in part, the vaccine failure observed during some mumps outbreaks.</P>

<P>Currently, this is the only review covering both effectiveness and safety issues of MMR vaccines. In agreement with results from other studies and reviews a significant association between autism and MMR exposure was not found. The study of Wakefield (<LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 1998</LINK>), linking MMR vaccination with autism, has been recently fully retracted (<LINK REF="REF-The-Editors-of-The-Lancet-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Editors of The Lancet 2010</LINK>) as Dr. Wakefield has been found guilty of ethical, medical and scientific misconduct in the publication of the paper; many other authors have moreover demonstrated that his data were fraudulent (<LINK REF="REF-Flaherty-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaherty 2011</LINK>). A formal retraction of the interpretation that there was a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism has already been issued in year 2004 by 10 out of the 12 original co-authors (<LINK REF="REF-Murch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murch 2004</LINK>). At that time (1998) an excessive and unjustified media coverage of this small study had disastrous consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Flaherty-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaherty 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Offit-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offit 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>), such as distrust of public health vaccination programmes, suspicion about vaccine safety, with a consequential significant decrease in MMR-vaccine coverage and re-emergence of measles in the UK.</P>

Children contributed to person-time follow-up from 1 year of age until age of 5, or until 31 December 2004, death or disappearance/emigration. Follow-up resulted in 2,926,406 person-years. In consequence of several reasons, 15,914 children terminated their follow-up prematurely (5455 because of death, 10,159 emigrated and 300 disappeared)</P>
<P>Follow-up length for the analysis of use of anti-asthma medication reached from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2004 as data about medical prescription were available only from 1996.

<TITLE>Vaccines for MMR in children</TITLE>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-09-16 17:59:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the title and the introduction, this is a review of the effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. However, the authors concluded that they "could find no comparative studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fitted [their] inclusion criteria as all had serological outcomes" and then continued to discuss only studies of MMR vaccine safety. The review and discussion of the safety of these vaccines accurately reflects the literature; rather this letter is about the conclusions regarding vaccine effectiveness.</P>
<P>The authors' conclusion that no comparative studies exist about the effectiveness of MMR vaccines do not seem to be borne out by other reviews of the literature. Using the stated inclusion criteria, one can find several studies of the effectiveness of MMR vaccine against individual diseases (measles, mumps or rubella) using cohort and case-control methods. Numerous retrospective studies have also documented the effectiveness of measles-containing vaccines (vs. MMR vaccine) for preventing measles. A partial list of articles found in PubMed using the criteria (measles OR mumps OR rubella) AND "vaccine efficacy", screened for articles including calculation of clinical vaccine efficacy, follows this feedback.</P>
<P>The authors also restricted their search to articles appearing in 1966 and later; given that measles vaccines were developed and used in clinical trials in the late 1950s and 1960s, the authors should strongly consider repeating their search for all years ? or, at a minimum, from 1954 to the present, given that measles virus was first isolated in 1954.</P>
<P>The authors fail to note that the effectiveness of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines were documented individually before their combination into MMR vaccine, and that the serological correlates of protection are well defined for protection against measles and rubella virus infections. These serological correlates of protection are now used to compare various vaccine virus strains and combinations.</P>
<P>I would strongly suggest that this review be revised so that it includes a discussion of articles that assess the efficacy of MMR vaccines or the individual vaccines included in MMR vaccines against their target diseases using any appropriate methodology. The authors could then compare the efficacy of the individual vaccines with that of the combined vaccine. If they choose not to include any of the articles found that demonstrate clinical vaccine efficacy, it would be helpful if the authors could provide a clear justification for doing so. At the very least, the title and introduction should be changed so that it is clear that the review is of studies of the safety of the vaccines, not their efficacy.</P>
<P>Thank you for your consideration of these comments</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Dear Dr. Perry, </P>
<P>Many thanks for the attention paid to our MMR vaccines review. We have read with interest you observation, we must though call your attention to the fact that for Cochrane Reviews inclusion criteria are established rigorously from an experienced team of specialists with the aim to made comparisons so homogeneous as possible and to consider preferably those outcomes that have direct implications for decision making in Public Health. For this reason the evaluation of evidences based only on serological parameters is debatable or at least not overall accepted at the rate of their indirect nature. </P>
<P>It shouldn't be forgotten that our review was also performed in order to provide some responses to an important specific question in Public Health regarding the suspected association of MMR vaccine with serious diseases. As reported in the conclusions, vaccine efficacy is in any case out of the question, since we consider as important point of evidence the fact that in many countries eradication of the targeted diseases could be achieved by means of mass immunisation programs. </P>
<P>We agree that studies in which single MMR antigens are tested could contribute some evidence, but in this review the only MMR in comparison with placebo or not intervention was considered. Effectiveness or efficacy of measles vaccine has been already reviewed by other authors (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ; all present in DARE). </P>
<P>Many studies out of those indicated by you in the list, report results of a single component vaccines and are for this reason not includible. In some of them MMR is tested, but all appear results of surveys and consequently their design is markedly affected from different types of biases which would preclude in any case their inclusion in the analysis. To complete background information about efficacy of MMR vaccines (or of different strain combinations), we may comment briefly on the evidence from these and other similar reports in occasion of the next update of the review. </P>

<P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
<P>I have a newborn baby and I am reviewing if I should vaccinate her or not. I am an osteopath and I am use to reading research but in this case I'm a little bit confused. And for that I would like some clarification. I would really appreciate some explanations on this as for now I don't feel your review is objective. But I might be mistaken and clarification would be welcome.</P>
<P>Please read my comments ahead on your article <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3/full</A>.</P>
<P>The conclusions of your article seem contradictory to your findings. Considering that:<BR/>Firstly, MMR studies are not well conducted, have low internal and external validity, have medium to high level of biases, don't have control groups, and<BR/>second, MMR may wain with time (more than natural exposure), is associated with aseptic meningitis, febrile seizures, febrile convulsions, acute or idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura, and<BR/>third, in your conclusion you summarise that MMR vaccine "reduces morbidity and mortality associated with mumps and rubella" contradicting yourself with "we found no studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR vaccine against rubella.</P>
<P>I am seriously wondering and considering if actually MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Therefore I don't understand your conclusions.<BR/>Thank you very much,<BR/>Arturo Fernandez</P>
<P>I do not have any affiliation with or involvement in any organisation with a financial interest in the subject matter of my comment.</P>

<P>A<B> case-control study</B> is an epidemiological study usually used to investigate the causes of disease. Study participants who have experienced an adverse outcome or disease are compared with participants who have not. Any differences in the presence or absence of hypothesised risk factors are noted.</P>
<P>A <B>cohort study</B> is an epidemiological study where groups of individuals are identified who vary in their exposure to an intervention or hazard and are followed to assess outcomes. Association between exposure and outcome are then estimated. Cohort studies are best performed prospectively but can also be undertaken retrospectively if suitable data records are available.</P>
<P>An <B>historical controlled trial</B> (HCT) is a study with control participants for whom data were collected at a time preceding that at which the data are gathered on the group being studied.</P>
<P>
<B>Indirect comparisons</B> are comparisons of the two or more index groups with a control (usually in randomly allocated groups). The comparisons are usually not contemporaneous and inference is made from the comparisons to the general population.</P>
<P>A <B>randomised controlled trial </B>(RCT) is any study on humans in which the individuals (or other experimental units) followed in the study were definitely or possibly assigned prospectively to one of two (or more) alternative forms of health care using random allocation.</P>
<P>A <B>controlled clinical trial</B> (CCT) is any study on humans in which the individuals (or other experimental units) followed in the study were definitely or possibly assigned prospectively to one of two (or more) alternative forms of health care using some quasi-random method of allocation (such as alternation, date of birth or case record number).</P>
<P>A <B>time-series</B> <B>study</B> is a comparative design with controls in which measurements are made at different times to allow trend detection and before-and-after exposure assessment.</P>
<P>An <B>ecological study</B> is a study in which the units of analysis are populations or groups of people rather than individuals. Inference is then made by observing the difference in incidence between populations of the event in question.</P>
<P>A <B>case cross-over study</B> is a design in which exposures of individuals during one period is compared by matched-pair analyses to their own exposure during a preceding period of similar length.</P>
<P>
<B>Case-coverage design</B> is a study comparing prevalence of exposure in individuals with exposure in the reference population. No denominator data are required and the population coverage information is derived from summary statistics. When coverage information is derived from a population sample, the design is that of a case-base study.</P>
<P>A <B>self controlled case series</B> <B>study</B> uses individuals as their own controls. The ages at vaccination are regarded as fixed and the age at the time of an adverse event is the random variable of interest within a pre-determined observation period.</P>
<P>A<B> person-time cohort study</B> is a study in which outcome rates in higher and lower risk periods for the same individuals are compared. The time of exposure is regarded as fixed and person-time periods for the risk categories are added and the rates are compared. When the risk periods are not summed but are within each individual, the design is that of a <B>self controlled case series study.</B>

<P>
<I>- Was the time frame appropriate?</I>
</P>
<P>Adequate: the outcomes being measured are detectable within the study time frame.</P>
<P>Inadequate: brevity of time frame precludes accurate measure, e.g. of long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>Unknown: no mention in text.</P>
<P>
<I>- Was exposure adequate and appropriate?</I>
</P>
<P>Adequate: sufficient time to allow plausible association was allowed. Exposure was to the vaccine and no obvious confounding interventions were present.</P>
<P>CRD QUALITY ASSESSMENT SCALE - ECOLOGICAL STUDIES</P>
<P>
<I>- Were the population selection criteria appropriate?</I>
</P>
<P>Appropriate - anything likely to minimise the play of confounders e.g. same age and ethnic group</P>
