<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:16:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>We could not find any evidence from randomized controlled trials that progestogen beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy can generally prevent miscarriage.</P>
<P>Hormones called progestogens prepare the womb (uterus) to receive and support the newly fertilized egg. It has been suggested that some women who miscarry may not make enough progesterone in the early part of pregnancy, so supplementing with progesterone has been suggested as a possible way to prevent miscarriage. This review of 14 randomized controlled trials (2158 women) found no evidence that progestogens can prevent miscarriage. No difference in the incidence of adverse effects on either the mother or baby were apparent. There was evidence, however, that women who have suffered three or more miscarriages may benefit from progestogen during pregnancy. Four trials showed a decrease in miscarriage compared with placebo or no treatment in these women, however, the trials were of poorer methodological quality so these findings should be interpreted with caution. No differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) verus placebo or no treatment. More trials are needed and are under way to further clarify the effects in women with multiple prior miscarriages and to further clarify any impact on fetal anomalies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:15:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, progestogens have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:15:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Fourteen trials (2158 women) are included. The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.24) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of placebo controlled trials did not find a difference in the rate of miscarriage with the use of progestogen (10 trials, 1028 women; Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50).</P>
<P>In a subgroup analysis of four trials involving women who had recurrent miscarriages (three or more consecutive miscarriages; four trials, 225 women), progestogen treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in miscarriage rate compared to placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72). However, these four trials were of poorer methodological quality. No statistically significant differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) versus placebo or no treatment. No significant differences in the rates of preterm birth, neonatal death, or fetal genital anomalies/virilization were found between progestogen therapy versus placebo/control.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-02-11 15:29:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid-pregnancy. However, there seems to be evidence of benefit in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. Treatment for these women may be warranted given the reduced rates of miscarriage in the treatment group and the finding of no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in rates of adverse effects suffered by either mother or baby in the available evidence. Larger trials are currently underway to inform treatment for this group of women.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:56:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The term miscarriage refers to the loss of a pregnancy prior to the fetus being viable. Vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, with or without pain, is known as threatened miscarriage. This can present with anything from spots of blood to potentially fatal shock (<LINK REF="REF-McBride-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McBride 1991</LINK>). Once dilation of the cervix has begun, miscarriage is inevitable (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten per cent to 15% of all clinically recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Regan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 1989</LINK>), with 1% to 2% of couples suffering recurrent early losses (traditionally defined as three or more spontaneous miscarriages) (<LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1991</LINK>). It is thought, however, that the true incidence of early spontaneous miscarriage may be much higher (<LINK REF="REF-Grudzinskas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grudzinskas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1991</LINK>). Miscarriage is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been estimated that, in over half of miscarriages, a chromosomal abnormality is present (<LINK REF="REF-Burgoyne-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgoyne 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szabo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szabo 1996</LINK>). Other risk factors include maternal age greater than 35 years, multiple pregnancies, uterine malformations, polycystic ovaries, autoimmune factors (such as phospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies), genetic disorders, poorly controlled diabetes, and having had two or more miscarriages (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2005</LINK>). For many couples, a cause may never be found.</P>
<P>The occurrence of a miscarriage may induce significant emotional distress in both partners. Initial emotional numbness and denial, anxiety, shock, sense of loss, sadness, emptiness, anger, inadequacy, blame and jealousy, depression, sleep disturbance, social withdrawal, anger and marital disturbance have all been described as emotional responses to pregnancy loss (<LINK REF="REF-Atkin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyregrove-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyregrove 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vance-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vance 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the development of ultrasound has come the ability to rapidly and accurately establish the viability of a pregnancy, and the technology to predict if a pregnancy is likely to continue when there is bleeding. In situations where ultrasound has been available, the care of women with threatened miscarriage has been rationalized. Attempts to maintain a pregnancy are only likely to be effective if the fetus is viable, and is without chromosomal abnormality (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:53:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Progesterone and other progestogens can be given to women orally, vaginally, intramuscularly, or by other routes. Supplementing a pregnancy with progestin often begins early in pregnancy and can continue through the first trimester and beyond.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It is secreted chiefly by the corpus luteum, a group of cells formed in the ovary after the follicle ruptures during the release of the egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and in the early weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, progestogens have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. Their use is particularly common with assisted reproductive technologies.</P>
<P>A review of pregnancy rates following hormonal treatments concluded that the benefits of therapy are uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Karamadian-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karamadian 1992</LINK>). A 1989 meta-analysis of six trials concluded that exogenous progesterone supplementation after conception does not improve pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Regan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 1989</LINK>). It was concluded that low levels of progesterone in early pregnancy reflected an already failed pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concerns have been raised that the use of progestogens, with their uterine-relaxant properties, in women with fertilized defective ova may cause a delay in spontaneous abortion. Several reports also suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to progesterone containing drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy and genital abnormalities in male and female fetuses. The risk of hypospadias (deformities of the penis or urethra, or both), five to eight per 1000 male births in the general population, may be increased with exposure to these drugs(<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2011</LINK>). However, some studies do not report increased risk with exposure to these drugs and progesterone supplementation is commonly utilized in assisted reproduction settings. There are insufficient data to quantify the risk to exposed female fetuses. Due to some of these reports and the fact that the urogenital groove is fused by 16 weeks, it has been recommended that progesterone containing drugs be avoided in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Several Cochrane Reviews have been initiated to investigate different interventions for the prevention of miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bamigboye-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamigboye 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lede-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2011</LINK>).

<P>We did not include cluster-randomized trials in this Review. In future updates, if high-quality cluster-randomized trials are identified, we will consider including them in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> Section 16.3.4 using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>In this 2013 update, we used fixed-effect meta-analysis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:19:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of progestogens to prevent miscarriage. Although there has been much speculation that progestogens may reduce the miscarriage rate, the results of this meta-analysis show no statistically significant difference between women receiving progestogen and those receiving only placebo or no treatment, when no provision is made for obstetric history. Subgroup analysis by method of administration (oral, intramuscular or vaginal) also showed no statistically significant difference between progestogen and placebo groups.</P>
<P>However, when provision was made for obstetric history, by way of a subgroup analysis only including women who had suffered three or more consecutive miscarriages directly prior to the studied pregnancy, a statistically significant difference was found in favor of the progestogen group. This finding should be approached with caution, however, as numbers are small and the trials were of poor methodological quality. Two trials are currently underway to further evaluate therapy in this subgroup of women. In addition, some studies included data for women who had two or more miscarriages but as this is not the classic definition of recurrent miscarriage, a separate analysis including these women was not carried out.<BR/>
<BR/>The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the number of fetal abnormalities (including virilization and hypospadias) in babies whose mothers had been given progestogens whilst in vitro, nor in intrauterine death/still birth or neonatal death.</P>
<P>There has been much discussion as to whether progestogen may prevent preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1990</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in our meta-analysis between the number of preterm births in the progestogen and placebo groups. However, it is important to note that this systematic review only assesses progestogen given in early pregnancy to prevent miscarriage, rather than trials assessing progestogen given in the second or third trimester to try to prevent preterm delivery.</P>
<P>No studies reported adverse maternal effects.</P>

</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-10-16 15:19:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderately good. The majority of the studies were conducted before robust reporting of methods was instituted. This led to "unclear" evaluations for many of the study 'Risk of bias' categories based simply on the area not being explicitly stated. For the time the studies were performed, the overall quality appears to be reasonable.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:53:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The review process identified trials from a heterogenous set of conditions. All used the same treatment for the same outcome, however the differences in condition make the data difficult to interpret.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-17 14:17:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>These results for women with recurrent miscarriage agree with a systematic review conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Coomarasamy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coomarasamy 2011</LINK> that included four of the trials included in this review.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid-pregnancy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-02-11 16:20:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>A finding of a significantly reduced miscarriage rate in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (three or more consecutive miscarriages) deserves further study.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (January 2008).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are given a code (or codes) depending on the topic. The codes are linked to review topics. The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using these codes rather than keywords.</P>
<P>In addition, authors searched:</P>
<P>MEDLINE: 1966 to June 2006;<BR/>EMBASE: 1980 to June 2006;<BR/>CINAHL: 1982 to June 2006.</P>
<P>See below for search strategy used.</P>
<P>We adapted the search strategy to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 4).</P>
<P>We searched the following trial registers:<BR/>NHMRC Clinical Trials Register (June 2006);<BR/>Meta-Register (June 2006).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. The selection of trials for inclusion in the initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Oates_x002d_Whitehead-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates-Whitehead 2003</LINK>) was performed by the two review authors (Richmal Oates-Whitehead and Judith Carrier) after employing the search strategy described previously. The lead review author, David M Haas, assessed the trials for inclusion in the updated review following the search strategy described previously.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Methods used for generation of the randomization sequence are described for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomization, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow-up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
<P>The quality and methodology of all studies, which were deemed eligible for the initial review, were then assessed independently by two review authors. Discrepancies were to be resolved by discussion but this proved unnecessary. Included trials were analyzed for the following quality criteria and methodological details. For the updated review, the lead review author assessed the eligibility of the quality and methodology of the study. This information is presented in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table and provides a context for discussing the reliability of results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial characteristics</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Method of randomization</LI>
<LI>Presence or absence of blinding to treatment allocation</LI>
<LI>Quality of allocation concealment</LI>
<LI>Number of women randomized, excluded or lost to follow-up</LI>
<LI>Whether an intention-to-treat analysis was done</LI>
<LI>Whether a power calculation was done</LI>
<LI>Duration, timing and location of the study</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of the study participants</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Age and any other recorded characteristics of women in the study</LI>
<LI>Gestational stage</LI>
<LI>Gravida and parity</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions used</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Synthetic or natural progestogen</LI>
<LI>Route of administration</LI>
<LI>Dose</LI>
<LI>Timing of administration</LI>
</OL>
<P>If the method of randomization was unclear from the original paper, every attempt was made to contact the authors of the original studies. However, due to the age of the studies, contact was rarely possible. Where randomization is stated, but the method of randomization could not be confirmed with the authors, the study has been treated as quasi-randomized in the analysis. If it was unclear as to whether any randomization, quasi or otherwise, had occurred and the authors of the trials could not be contacted, we excluded these papers from the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. Two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter all the data or a sub-sample.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method. The summary statistics were calculated using both the fixed-effect and a random-effects model with no statistical difference in results being shown between the two methods. The results shown in the 'Comparison and data table' section of this review are presented using the fixed-effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>It was planned that continuous differences between groups in the meta-analysis would be expressed as a weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval. However, no continuous data were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>There were no cluster-randomized trials. All trials randomized individuals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>There were no cross-over trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Available case analysis</HEADING>
<P>We analyzed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If, in the original reports, participants were not analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We applied tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. When high levels of heterogeneity were identified among the trials (exceeding 50%), we explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and perform sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used as an overall summary if this was considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We conducted planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>We carried out the following subgroup analyses: placebo controlled trials only; women who had at least three consecutive miscarriages; oral progestogen versus placebo; intramuscular progestogen versus placebo; and vaginal progestogen versus placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality. This involved analysis based on an A, B, C, or D rating of selection bias and attrition bias. We excluded studies of poor quality in the analysis (those rating B, C, or D) in order to assess for any substantive difference to the overall result.</P>
