<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the existing review of 'Cooling for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy' that was published in the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Issue 4, 2003 (Jacobs 2003).<BR/>
<BR/>Since the first version of this review, it has become apparent that not all control infants randomised to 'normothermia' had their temperature in the normal range. Therefore, 'normothermia' has been renamed 'standard care' in this updated review.<BR/>
<BR/>Six additional randomised controlled trials and 587 additional infants were included in the review (8 trials and 638 total infants); a further 4 studies were excluded. We are awaiting further information or publication of one completed randomised trial comprising 157 infants. Long-term follow-up from 3 ongoing trials is awaited, all having completed or stopped recruitment. These additional 829 infants will be incorporated into future updates of this review, and could change the results and overturn the conclusions of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>The evidence for therapeutic hypothermia has changed significantly since the 2003 review, which concluded that there was a lack of evidence that therapeutic hypothermia was either beneficial or harmful to newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and that cooling should only be performed in the context of randomised controlled trials. This 2007 update concludes that there is evidence that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial to term newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and that cooling decreases death, without increasing major disability in survivors. The benefits of cooling on survival and neurodevelopment outweigh the short-term adverse effects.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that induced hypothermia (cooling) of newborn babies who may have suffered from a lack of oxygen at birth reduces death or disability, without increasing disability in survivors. This means that parents should expect that cooling will decrease their baby's chance of dying, and that if their baby survives, cooling will decrease his/her chance of major disability. A lack of oxygen before and during birth can destroy cells in a newborn baby's brain. The damage caused by the lack of oxygen continues for some time afterwards. One way to try to stop this damage is to induce hypothermia - cooling the baby or just the baby's head for hours to days. This treatment may reduce the amount of damage to brain cells. This review found that there is evidence from trials to show that induced hypothermia helps to improve survival and development at 18 to 24 months for term and late preterm newborn babies at risk of brain damage. More research is needed to understand which infants need cooling and the best way of cooling, including duration of treatment and method of cooling.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 2, 2007). Randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic hypothermia in term and late preterm newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy were identified by searching the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007), previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching. We updated this search in May 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing the use of therapeutic hypothermia with standard care in encephalopathic term or late preterm infants with evidence of peripartum asphyxia and without recognisable major congenital anomalies. The primary outcome measure was death or long-term major neurodevelopmental disability. Other outcomes included adverse effects of cooling and 'early' indicators of neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of and extracted data from the included studies. Study authors were contacted for further information. Meta-analyses were performed using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 11 randomised controlled trials in this updated review, comprising 1505 term and late preterm infants with moderate/severe encephalopathy and evidence of intrapartum asphyxia. Therapeutic hypothermia resulted in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in the combined outcome of mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability to 18 months of age (typical RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.83); typical RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.10); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) (8 studies, 1344 infants). Cooling also resulted in statistically significant reductions in mortality (typical RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.88), typical RD -0.09 (95% CI -0.13 to -0.04); NNTB 11 (95% CI 8 to 25) (11 studies, 1468 infants) and in neurodevelopmental disability in survivors (typical RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.94), typical RD -0.13 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.07); NNTB 8 (95% CI 5 to 14) (8 studies, 917 infants). Some adverse effects of hypothermia included an increase sinus bradycardia and a significant increase in thrombocytopenia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from the 11 randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review (N = 1505 infants) that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial in term and late preterm newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Cooling reduces mortality without increasing major disability in survivors. The benefits of cooling on survival and neurodevelopment outweigh the short-term adverse effects. Hypothermia should be instituted in term and late preterm infants with moderate-to-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy if identified before six hours of age. Further trials to determine the appropriate techniques of cooling, including refinement of patient selection, duration of cooling and method of providing therapeutic hypothermia, will refine our understanding of this intervention.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-10 15:57:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:15:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In technically developed countries, peripartum asphyxia affects three to five newborns per 1000 live births with subsequent moderate or severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in 0.5 to 1 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1986</LINK>). HIE is a major problem worldwide as 10% to 60% of affected infants die, and at least 25% of survivors have long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Vannucci-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vannucci 1990</LINK>). There are no specific treatments shown to decrease brain damage from HIE. Hypothermia is a clinically feasible manoeuvre that may improve the outcome of neonates with HIE.</P>
<P>Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that neuronal death occurs in two phases following a reversible hypoxic-ischaemic global insult (<LINK REF="REF-Gluckman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluckman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorek 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penrice-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penrice 1996</LINK>). If the insult is severe, there may be immediate 'primary neuronal death' related to cellular hypoxia with exhaustion of the cell's high-energy stores (primary energy failure). After a latent period of at least six hours, the secondary phase of 'delayed neuronal death' begins (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1991</LINK>). The mechanisms involved in delayed neuronal death include hyperaemia, cytotoxic oedema, mitochondrial failure, accumulation of excitotoxins, active cell death (analogous to developmental apoptosis), nitric oxide synthesis, free radical damage and cytotoxic actions of activated microglia (<LINK REF="REF-Inder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inder 2000</LINK>). The delayed phase is associated with encephalopathy and increased seizure activity, and accounts for a significant proportion of the final cell loss even after very severe insults.</P>
<P>In term and late preterm infants with evidence of intrapartum hypoxia and moderate-to-severe encephalopathy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies are consistent with this biphasic model of neuronal death. These studies demonstrate normal cerebral oxidative metabolism shortly after birth followed by 'secondary energy failure', the degree of which predicts outcome (mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome at both one and four years of age) (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1997</LINK>). Therefore, a therapeutic 'window of opportunity' exists in the interval following resuscitation of the asphyxiated newborn before the secondary phase of impaired energy metabolism and injury.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:15:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapeutic hypothermia aims to lower the temperature of the vulnerable deep brain structures, the basal ganglia, to 32 °C to 34 °C. Two methods are being evaluated in newborn infants with HIE: whole body cooling and selective head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia. The rationale for selective head cooling is that the newborn infant's brain produces 70% of total body heat and that systemic hypothermia may be physiologically harmful to the sick neonate. Therefore, the adverse effects of systemic cooling may be minimised by selectively cooling the brain more than the body (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 1998a</LINK>). However, a<B> </B>theoretical modelling of cooling investigating temperature distribution within the neonatal head found that the only situation that resulted in a significant reduction in deep brain temperature was when the core body temperature was lowered to 34 °C, implying that it is necessary to reduce systemic temperature to achieve deep brain cooling (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Leeuwen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Leeuwen 2000</LINK>). Whole body cooling relies on core body and deep brain temperatures being similar.<B>
<BR/>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-10 15:57:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of postulated mechanisms by which hypothermia may be neuroprotective. Hypothermia may modify cells programmed for apoptosis, leading to their survival. In neonatal piglets, 12 hours of mild hypothermia after resuscitation significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells, but not the number of necrotic cells (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1995</LINK>). Hypothermia may also protect neurons by reducing cerebral metabolic rate, attenuating the release of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, dopamine), ameliorating the ischaemia-impaired uptake of glutamate and lowering production of toxic nitric oxide (NO) and free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Globus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globus 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several term and preterm animal experimental models have demonstrated that a reduction in brain temperature of 2 °C to 3 °C immediately following a hypoxic Ischaemic insult reduces energy expenditure, improves subsequent performance testing, reduces histological neuronal loss, or a combination of these (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laptook-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2001</LINK>). In the term fetal lamb, a significant reduction in histological neuronal loss was seen with extradural temperatures below 35 °C (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 1997a</LINK>). Temperature modelling calculations also suggest that lowering an infant's core temperature to below 35 °C is required to produce any reduction in the deep brain temperature (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Leeuwen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Leeuwen 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>For many decades, deep hypothermia to less than 28 °C has been shown to be valuable for neuroprotection during cardiac arrest for open-heart and neurosurgical procedures. However, one Cochrane systematic review has called into question utility of hypothermia following neurological surgery. In one meta-analysis of four trials of cooling for cerebral protection during neurological surgery, <LINK REF="REF-Milani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milani 2011</LINK> did not find significant reductions in mortality or neurological outcomes, though a trend towards improvement in both outcomes was seen. The results in other studies utilising hypothermia in adults have been similarly unclear. There are five Cochrane systematic reviews of the effects of systemic cooling on outcome of adults following head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009</LINK>), acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Hertog-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Hertog 2009</LINK>), coronary artery bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2001</LINK>), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (<LINK REF="REF-Arrich-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrich 2012</LINK>), and intracranial aneurysm surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012</LINK>). While two of these trials found that the patients treated with hypothermia improved neurological outcomes following traumatic head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009</LINK>) and CPR (<LINK REF="REF-Arrich-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrich 2012</LINK>), they did not demonstrate a reduction in mortality. Three reviews did not demonstrate significant improvements in death or dependency with the use of hypothermia following coronary artery bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2001</LINK>), acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Hertog-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Hertog 2009</LINK>) or intracranial aneurysm surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012</LINK>). However, there were no significant adverse events following hypothermia in any of these reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Hertog-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Hertog 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009</LINK>), though a trend towards increased infections (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Hertog-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Hertog 2009</LINK>) and pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009</LINK>) was seen. As such, it appears that hypothermia is well tolerated, though its effectiveness is not fully established for all conditions.</P>
<P>Mild hypothermia appears to be well tolerated in a variety of experimental animal models, as well as in adult human studies (<LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunn-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haaland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haaland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marion-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marion 1997</LINK>). There were no reported serious adverse effects in four pilot studies of hypothermia in human newborns (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thoresen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thoresen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankaran-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shankaran 2002</LINK>). Adverse effects, such as sinus bradycardia, increased blood pressure and increased oxygen requirement, were all transient and reversible with re-warming (<LINK REF="STD-Thoresen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thoresen 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Identification of infants with hypoxic ischaemic brain injury at risk of future disability who may benefit from hypothermia is challenging. It may be particularly difficult to distinguish between encephalopathy secondary to intrapartum hypoxia and that related to antepartum factors (<LINK REF="REF-Badawi-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badawi 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Badawi-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badawi 1998b</LINK>) or underlying congenital abnormalities not easily recognisable at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Felix-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felix 2000</LINK>). Newborn animal and adult<B> </B>human studies are consistent with the potential for rescue hypothermia being greatest following moderate, rather than severe, hypoxic ischaemic insults (<LINK REF="REF-Haaland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haaland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marion-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marion 1997</LINK>). Aspects of cooling therapy that remain controversial include: how soon after the insult or birth does cooling need to be started, what level of hypothermia is required, what method (selective head cooling versus whole body cooling) should be used and what is the duration of cooling required?</P>

<P>We sought information regarding the method of randomisation, blinding and reporting of outcomes of all infants enrolled in the trial for each trial. We obtained data from the primary investigator for unpublished trials or when published data were incomplete. For the initial review, three review authors (SJ, PD and RH) independently retrieved articles, assessed and data abstracted.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:16:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methodological quality assessment was based on 1) blinding of randomisation, 2) blinding of intervention, 3) completeness of follow-up and 4) blinding of outcome measurement. When necessary, additional information and clarification of published data was requested from the authors of individual trials.</P>
<P>The review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the following criteria.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): for each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk. </LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): for each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; e.g. unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): for each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We characterised the methods used for blinding as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations): for each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>5. Selective reporting bias: for each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: for each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>7. Overall risk of bias</P>
<P>We made explicit judgements regarding whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses (see '<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>' below).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gunn 1998</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK> reported the short-term medical outcomes of 22 term infants with HIE (10 controls randomised to normothermia and 12 randomised to hypothermia) in a randomised controlled pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>). The first six randomised hypothermic infants received minimal cooling (36.0 °C to 36.5 °C; N = 6) and then the next six mild cooling (35.5 °C to 35.9 °C; N = 6) as part of this 'safety' study. The study continued and the 18-month outcome of these 22 infants, together with a further 18 infants (nine randomised (three normothermic controls, with six allocated to hypothermia to 34.5 °C to 35.4 °C) and nine non-randomised (two controls, seven cooled to 34 °C to 35 °C)) were reported in a subsequent publication (Battin 2001). Infants were cooled for 72 hours; however, re-warming was permitted after 48 hours if there was evidence of neurological recovery. The combined results of the 31 randomised infants (13 normothermic controls, 18 allocated to hypothermia) are presented (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>), with individual patient data provided by the authors. The non-randomised patients were not included in this review. There was one further report of short-term medical outcomes arising from these studies that included the 13 randomised control infants with six infants randomised to 34.5 °C to 35.4 °C and the seven non-randomised infants at 34 °C to 35 °C (Battin 2003). For the purpose of this systematic review, all randomised infants in the various reports (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>, Battin 2001, Battin 2003) are included in the study referred to as <LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>. This study did not report whether any infants had treatment withdrawn prior to death. Eighteen-month neurodevelopmental outcome assessment using the BSID was performed by a psychologist blinded to treatment allocation and was complete in all patients. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were determined from Table 2 in Battin 2001, and comprised randomised infants (normothermia, numbers 1 to 13; hypothermia, numbers 16 to 33) ascertained from the author. Adverse neurodevelopmental outcome was defined by <LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK> as BSID MDI or PDI &lt; 70.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Shankaran-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shankaran 2002</LINK> reported the short-term medical outcomes to hospital discharge of 19 infants of 36 weeks' gestation or greater and less than six hours of age with evidence of peripartum asphyxia (defined by pH or base deficit within first hour of life; evidence of acute perinatal event and depressed Apgars or need for assisted ventilation at 10 minutes of life; or both) and either seizures or moderate/severe encephalopathy (assessed via level of consciousness, spontaneous activity, posture, primitive reflexes, and autonomic nervous system abnormalities). There were 10 controls and nine infants randomised to therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours at 34.5 °C by means of a servo-controlled cooling blanket. Adverse events reported include hypotension, PPHN, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, DIC and data on hospital course (days on oxygen, length of stay). Withdrawal of care preceded three of five deaths (2/2 cooled and 1/3 standard care).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Akisu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Akisu 2003</LINK> reported the short-term medical outcomes to discharge from hospital of 21 term infants with peripartum asphyxia (defined by pH or base deficit shortly after birth and five-minute Apgar score) and encephalopathy (presence of stupor, hypotonia or abnormal neonatal reflexes). Eleven infants had their temperature lowered by cooling caps with cold water at 5 °C to 10 °C placed around the scalp for 72 hours. The left external auditory canal and rectal temperatures were monitored to maintain the external auditory canal temperature at 33 °C to 33.5 °C, while the rectal temperature was maintained at 36 °C to 36.5 °C with the servo-mechanism of the radiant warmer. Ten control infants also had their rectal temperature maintained at 36 °C to 36.5 °C with the servo-mechanism of the radiant warmer. An additional seven non-randomised term control infants without asphyxia were not included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Akisu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Akisu 2003</LINK>). Adverse effects were reported, including bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, renal impairment, hypoglycaemia, sepsis, thrombocytopenia and short-term outcome to discharge from hospital (mortality, length of hospital stay, seizures, abnormal EEG, abnormal cranial ultrasound and CT scan). Decisions to withdraw care were not reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Eicher 2005</HEADING>
<P>In two consecutive publications, <LINK REF="STD-Eicher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eicher 2005</LINK> reported in-hospital morbidity with mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes to 12 months of 65 infants of 35 weeks' gestation or greater with evidence of fetal or postnatal hypoxia-ischaemia (based upon pH or base deficit, 10-minute Apgar score, need for resuscitation after five minutes, or a combination), and encephalopathy (two of: posturing; seizures; autonomic dysfunction; or abnormalities of tone, reflexes or state of consciousness) at up to six hours of life. Thirty-two infants had their temperature lowered by the initial application of ice to head and body for up to two hours that was then maintained at 32.5 °C to 33.5 °C (rectal) on a servo-controlled cooling blanket for 48 hours. Thirty-three control infants had their rectal temperature maintained at 36.5 °C to 37.5 °C by servo-controlled radiant warmer (<LINK REF="STD-Eicher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eicher 2005</LINK>). Data presented on short-term adverse effects of cooling included coagulopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, persistent metabolic acidosis, sepsis/pneumonia within the first seven days of life, hypokalaemia, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), skin injury, extension of intracranial haemorrhage, PPHN of the newborn, and treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Eighteen of 24 deaths were preceded by withdrawal of care (9/10 cooled and 9/14 standard care). Neurodevelopmental outcome to 12 months of age was assessed in 28/41 or 68% of surviving infants (17/22 or 77% of cooled infants and 11/19 or 58% of standard care infants) using the BSID, Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS) or Vineland examinations at 12 months of age by the developmental team blinded to study group assignment. Severe neuromotor disability was defined by <LINK REF="STD-Eicher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eicher 2005</LINK> as BSID PDI &lt; 70. This study was considered to be of lower quality because the neurodevelopmental outcome assessment was at 12 months rather than 18 to 24 months, follow-up was incomplete (81%) and only composite outcome of death or severe neuromotor impairment was reported.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK>, for the CoolCap Study Group, reported mortality and severe neuromotor disability to 18 months of age in 234 infants of 36 weeks' gestation or greater born with evidence of peripartum hypoxia-ischaemia (based upon pH or base deficit, 10-minute Apgar score and need for resuscitation after 10 minutes), moderate or severe encephalopathy (Sarnat criteria) or clinical seizures and moderate or severely abnormal background or seizures on aEEG. One hundred and sixteen infants underwent head cooling by cooling cap while receiving care on a radiant warmer servo-controlled to the infants' abdominal skin temperature adjusted to maintain the rectal temperature at 34 °C to 35 °C for 72 hours. One hundred and eighteen infants received standard care on the radiant warmer servo-controlled to infant's abdominal skin temperature that was adjusted to maintain rectal temperature at 36.8 °C to 37.2 °C (<LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK>), although several non-cooled infants had elevation of body temperature greater than 38 °C. Adverse events were reported, including arrhythmia, hypotension, coagulopathy, abnormal renal function, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, bone marrow depression, abnormal liver function and metabolic acidosis. This study did not report withdrawal of care in deaths. The 18-month neurodevelopmental assessment (neurological examination, visual and auditory assessment and BSID) was performed in 136/156 or 89.5% of surviving infants (68/76 or 89.5% of cooled infants and 68/76 or 89.5% of standard care infants) by qualified staff and developmental psychologists blinded to treatment group assignment. Severe neurodevelopmental disability was defined by <LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK> as gross motor function (GMF) level 3 to 5, BSID MDI &lt; 70, or bilateral cortical visual impairment. In this review, we subtracted "died" from "died or severe disability at 18 months" as reported in Table 3 of <LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK> to obtain major neurodevelopmental disability.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>, for the NICHD Neonatal Research Network, reported mortality and moderate/severe disability at 18 to 22 months for 208 infants at 36 weeks' gestation or greater and less than six hours of age with either severe acidosis (or moderate acidosis with additional criteria) as well as evidence of encephalopathy (on standardised neurological examination by a qualified examiner) or clinical seizures. Acidosis was defined by pH or base deficit on cord or blood gas within one hour of birth), and additional criteria included an acute perinatal event (late or variable decelerations, cord prolapse, cord rupture, uterine rupture, maternal trauma, haemorrhage or cardiorespiratory arrest) along with an Apgar score of &#8804; 5 at 10 minutes or need for assisted ventilation initiated at birth and continued for at least 10 minutes. Criteria for encephalopathy included assessment of loss of consciousness (LOC), spontaneous activity, posture, primitive reflexes and autonomic nervous system abnormalities. One hundred and two infants were placed on a pre-cooled infant blanket servo-controlled to oesophageal temperature of 33 °C to 34 °C for 72 hours; a second blanket was included in the cooling system to diminish oesophageal temperature variability. One hundred and six infants received standard care with skin temperature servo-controlled to abdominal skin temperature 36.5 °C to 37 °C (<LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>). All infants had abdominal and oesophageal temperature monitoring. Initial mean temperature of hypothermic infants on cooling was 32.7 °C. Several non-cooled infants had elevation of body temperature greater than 38 °C. Data collected on adverse events included those during the 72-hour intervention (cardiac arrhythmia, persistent acidosis, major thrombosis or bleeding, skin changes, death) and those prior to hospital discharge (hypotension, PPHN, renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, sepsis, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, death, length of stay, feeding status and use of anticonvulsants at discharge). Withdrawal of care preceded death in 39 of the 62 deaths (12/24 cooled and 27/38 standard care). Trained developmental examiners blinded to treatment group assignment performed the 18- to 22-month neurodevelopmental assessment of growth, vision, hearing, neurological examination and development using the BSID in 205/208 or 99% of surviving infants (three control infants lost to follow-up). Severe disability was defined by <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK> as any of the following: GMF level 3 to 5, BSID MDI &lt; 70, hearing impairment requiring hearing aids or blindness. As a component of their primary outcome, <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK> reported "moderate or severe disability." However, as shown in Table 4 of <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>, among the 45 and 64 cooled and control infants who died or had moderate or severe disability, 43 and 62, respectively, either died or had BSID MDI &lt; 70 at follow-up at 18 to 22 months. Thus, the vast majority of survivors, if not all, who met the <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK> criteria for moderate or severe disability in fact had severe disability by their definition. We used the numbers reported by <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK> for moderate or severe disability to define major neurodevelopmental disability in this review. For this study, moderate-to-severe disability was defined as an IQ score 2 or more SD below the mean (scored by Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III, score 69 or lower), a GMF level of III or greater, bilateral deafness (with or without amplification), bilateral blindness or refractory epilepsy. Follow-up at six to seven years occurred in 190/208 or 91% of patients (97/102 or 95% cooled and 93/106 or 88% controls). A number of follow-up reports were included in this study, providing data on safety and effectiveness (Shankaran 2008), seizures (Kwon 2010), MRI findings (Shankaran 2011) and follow-up at six to seven years (Shankaran 2012). The average age on completion of MRI was 15 ± 12 days, and data presented are from infants with moderate-to-severe injury as classified by the Rutherford 2010 pattern (Shankaran 2011).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2006</LINK> reported short-term outcomes to 10 days of age including mortality, moderate-to-severe brain injury on CT scan and neurobehavioural assessment for 62 consecutive infants of 37 weeks' gestation or greater with peripartum hypoxia-ischaemia (Apgar &lt; 6 at five minutes and acidosis defined by pH or base deficit) and clinical encephalopathy (decreased muscle tone, lethargy, coma or seizure). Infants were quasi-randomised (based on odd or even day of admission) within six hours of birth. Thirty-two infants had their temperature lowered by a cooling cap device shielded under radiant warmer with output to maintain rectal temperature at 34 °C to 35 °C for 72 hours. The 30 infants who received standard care had intermittent measurement of their rectal temperature, although the target temperature was not stated. Adverse events were not reported. Aspects of the medical treatment were standardised such that all infants received prophylactic phenobarbitone (loading and maintenance) and dopamine (5 &#956;g/kg/minute) throughout the 72-hour study period (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2006</LINK>). Decisions to withdraw life support preceded the four deaths. Mortality and short-term neurobehavioural outcomes (using Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment score) were assessed at seven to 10 days of life.</P>

<P>The TOBY Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>) reported mortality and neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months as well as adverse outcomes for 325 infants 36 weeks' gestation or greater with perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy. Criteria for inclusion were an Apgar of &#8804; 5 or continued need for resuscitation at 10 minutes, acidosis (defined by pH or base deficit within the first hour of life), and evidence of moderate-to-severe encephalopathy (lethargy, stupor or coma), and either hypotonia, abnormal reflexes, absent or weak suck, or clinical evidence of seizure. Additionally, infants had to have seizures or abnormal background for at least three minutes on aEEG. One-hundred and sixty-three infants were cooled via cooling blanket with a target rectal temperature of 33 °C to 34 °C (actual mean 33.5 °C). The thermostat of the cooling blanket was manually adjusted (not servo-controlled) to maintain the target rectal temperature of 33 °C to 34 °C. One-hundred and sixty-two infants received standard care with skin temperature servo-controlled to a target rectal temperature of 37 °C (actual mean 36.9 °C, several non-cooled infants had elevation of body temperature greater than 38 °C). All infants had continuous skin and rectal temperature monitoring. Adverse events recorded included the presence of intracranial haemorrhage, persistent hypotension, pulmonary haemorrhage, PPHN, prolonged blood coagulation time, culture-confirmed sepsis, NEC, thrombocytopenia, major venous thrombosis, renal failure requiring dialysis, pneumonia, pulmonary air leak and duration of hospitalisation. Withdrawal of care occurred in 63 of 86 deaths reported (34/39 or 87% in cooled and 29/39 or 74% in standard care). The 18-month neurodevelopmental assessment (neurological examination, visual and auditory assessment and BSID) was performed in 237/239 or 99% of surviving infants (one infant lost to follow-up in each group) by trained assessors blinded to treatment group assignment. Severe neurodevelopmental disability was defined by <LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK> as BSID MDI &lt; 70, GMF level 3 to 5 or bilateral cortical visual impairment. Additional data on MRI findings was presented in Rutherford 2010 and is included in this analysis, with an average age at MRI of eight days (range 2 days to 30 days). Major MRI abnormalities were defined as moderate or severe basal ganglia or thalamic lesions, severe white matter lesions or abnormalities of the posterior limb of the internal capsule.</P>

<P>The neo.nEURO.network (<LINK REF="STD-neo.nEURO-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">neo.nEURO Study 2010</LINK>) reported mortality or major sensorineural disability outcomes for 125 neonates of at least 36 weeks' gestation with evidence of birth asphyxia (Apgar &lt; 5 at 10 minute, need for continued resuscitation after 10 minutes, presence of acidosis on cord or arterial blood gas within 60 minutes of birth) and clinical evidence of encephalopathy (hypotonia, abnormal reflexes, absent/weak suck, clinical seizures, or a combination). Sixty-two infants were cooled via cooling mattress with a target rectal temperature of 33.5 °C (range 33.0 °C to 34.0 °C) for 72 hours. Temperature was controlled by manual adjustment of cooling mattress (not servo-controlled). Sixty-three infants received standard treatment with a target rectal temperature of 37 °C (range 36.5 °C to 37.5 °C). All infants received morphine (0.1 mg/kg) or an equivalent dose of fentanyl every four hours or by continuous infusion. Adverse events recorded included systemic hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures on EEG or clinical, intracranial haemorrhage, venous thrombosis, overt bleeding, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, haemoconcentration, systemic infection, arrhythmia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatraemia, elevated liver enzymes, pathological renal function, need for ventilatory support after initiation of intervention, need for inhaled NO or death during intervention. Deaths occurred in 20/62 or 32% of infants in hypothermia group and 33/63 or 52% of controls (non-significant). In the hypothermia group, 5% of deaths occurred while on maximal support, while 18.2% of such deaths occurred in the control group. A similar percentage of the deaths occurred in both groups following withdrawal of support (14/20 or 70.0% of cooled and 22/33 or 66.7% of infants receiving standard care).  Neurological assessments were performed via neurologists blinded to treatment allocation at 18 to 21 months in 58/76 or 76% of surviving infants (33/42 or 79% of cooled and 25/30 or 83% of standard care). Major sensorineural disability was defined by <LINK REF="STD-neo.nEURO-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">neo.nEURO Study 2010</LINK> as a neurological functional score of 3 to 5, development quotient (DQ) &lt; two SD (via Griffiths general quotient or Brunet-Lezine quotient), severe bilateral cortical visual impairment, or a combination.</P>

<P>The China Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>) reported mortality and severe neurodevelopmental disability for 194 neonates 37 weeks' gestation or greater admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within six hours of life with clinical evidence of exposure to perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia (as determined by Apgar scores at one and five minutes, acidosis on cord gas, or a need for resuscitation or ventilation at five minutes) or a diagnosis of encephalopathy (Sarnat). One hundred infants underwent head cooling via a semiconductor-controlled water circulation device for 72 hours, servo-controlled to target nasopharyngeal temperature of 33.8 °C to 34.2 °C, with additional use of a radiant warmer to target a rectal temperature of 34.5 °C to 35 °C. Ninety-four infants receiving standard treatment were cared for in servo-controlled radiant warmers with rectal temperature target 36 °C to 37.5 °C. Six infants treated with hypothermia and five controls had a temperature &gt; 38 °C. Adverse events recorded were classified as major (severe arrhythmia, major venous thrombosis, refractory hypotension, moderate or severe scleroedema, severe bleeding, scleroedema) and minor (mild arrhythmia, mild scleroedema, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, serum electrolyte or biochemical abnormalities). The study initially included 235 infants (119 cooled and 116 who received standard care), but 41 of these infants (19/119 or 16% of cooled and 22/116 or 22% of standard care) were lost to follow-up; no data were presented on short- or long-term outcomes for these infants. This study did not report withdrawal of care in deaths. For infants whose data were presented in this study, the 18-month neurodevelopmental assessment (neurological examination and developmental assessment) was performed in 138/147 surviving infants (75/80 or 93% of cooled and 63/67 or 94% of standard care) by qualified staff blinded to treatment group assignment. For infants who did not return for follow-up, outcomes were assessed by local trained paediatricians. Severe neuromotor disability was defined by the China Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>) as a DQ &lt; 70 (via Gessell Child Development Age Scale) or GMF level 3 to 5.</P>

<P>The Infant Cooling Evaluation Collaboration (<LINK REF="STD-ICE-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ICE Study 2011</LINK>) reported mortality and major sensorineural disability in 221 infants 35 weeks' gestation or greater with moderate or severe HIE (defined as lethargy, stupor, coma, abnormal tone, seizure, or a combination) and evidence of peripartum HIE (at least two of: Apgar &#8804; 5 at 10 minutes, continued need for mechanical ventilation after 10 minutes and metabolic acidosis on cord or arterial gas within 60 minutes of birth). One-hundred and ten infants were cooled by being exposed to the ambient environment (turning radiant warmer off) with refrigerated gel packs applied as required to maintain rectal temperature at 33 °C to 34 °C for 72 hours. One-hundred and eleven infants received standard care in a radiant warmer, with rectal temperature maintained at 36.8 °C to 37.3 °C. Recruitment was halted due to loss of equipoise. Adverse events recorded included cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, prolonged QT interval, hypotension requiring inotropes, overt bleeding, thrombosis or coagulopathy treated with fresh frozen plasma or cryoglobulin (or both), hypoxia while receiving a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) of 100% resulting in discontinuation of hypothermia, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, hepatic  dysfunction, rectal bleeding or NEC, sepsis and mortality. Decisions to withdraw support preceded death in 22/27 (81.5%) of cooled and 30/42 (71.4%) of control infants. A decision not to escalate support preceded death in an additional 4/27 (14.8%) of cooled and 9/42 (21.4%) of control infants. Neurodevelopmental assessments were performed at two years of age by trained developmental paediatricians and psychologists blinded to treatment group assignment in 146/152 (96%) of surviving infants (three lost to follow-up in each group).  Major sensorineural disability was defined as neuromotor delay (moderate or severe CP, BSID PDI or MDI of less than -2 SD, or a disability index on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GFMCS) of 2 to 5), developmental delay (BSID MDI, Cognitive Scale, or Language Composite Scale, score of less than -2 SD), blindness (vision worse than 20/200 in both eyes), deafness requiring amplification or worse, or a combination. Additional data on MRI findings were presented in Cheong 2012 and is included in this analysis, with an average age at MRI of six days (range three days to eight days). Major MRI abnormalities were defined as moderate or severe basal ganglia or thalamic lesions, severe white matter lesions or abnormalities of the posterior limb of the internal capsule according to the criteria employed in Rutherford 2010 (see <LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>The method of randomisation/allocation concealment in nine studies was achieved by means of computer-generated numbers either in opaque sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-neo.nEURO-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">neo.nEURO Study 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICE-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ICE Study 2011</LINK>) or obtained centrally from a data co-ordinating centre (<LINK REF="STD-Shankaran-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shankaran 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>) or web-based system (<LINK REF="STD-Eicher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eicher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>) used either a central data co-ordinating centre or a web-based system. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Akisu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Akisu 2003</LINK>), the method of randomisation and allocation concealment may have been adequate, but details of the computer-generated randomisation protocol were unclear. Allocation concealment was inadequate in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2006</LINK>) because it used quasi-randomisation by odd or even day of admission. Following randomisation of 31 infants, Gunn et al (see <LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>) obtained ethics approval to cool a further seven non-randomised infants who are not included in this review sequentially (Battin 2001). A further seven non-randomised control term infants without asphyxia in one study were also not included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Akisu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Akisu 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, the caregivers in these trials could not be blinded. Importantly, no study reported that the assessors of short-term outcomes were blinded to treatment allocation; this may have resulted in ascertainment bias.

There was no significant effect of hypothermia on the presence of deafness, seizures at follow-up or the need for gastric tube feeding at discharge. For short-term adverse outcomes, increases in the incidence of sinus bradycardia and thrombocytopenia were seen in infants treated with hypothermia. There was no significant effect of hypothermia on other short-term adverse outcomes, though an increase in leukopenia and a decrease in hypoglycaemia were seen in infants undergoing whole body cooling. Analyses of several secondary outcomes planned for this review were unable to be performed because they were not reported in the included trials. Planned subgroup analyses based on the degree and duration of cooling and re-warming, as well as electrophysiological plus clinical criteria versus clinical criteria alone, were still unable to be performed because of lack of eligible data.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:29:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The previous version of this systematic review demonstrated that therapeutic hypothermia for term and late preterm newborn infants with moderate or severe HIE resulted in a clinically important reduction in the composite outcome of mortality or neurodevelopmental disability to 18 to 24 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2007</LINK>). This review update has added three new randomised controlled trials including 644 infants (<LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-neo.nEURO-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">neo.nEURO Study 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>) and has also included 204 additional infants from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-ICE-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ICE Study 2011</LINK>) to bring the total infants included in the review to 1505.</P>
<P>The updated review confirms these important findings and adds precision to our estimates of effect. The meta-analysis of these 11 RCTs demonstrates a reduction in the composite outcome of mortality or neurodevelopmental disability to 18 to 24 months of age associated with hypothermia (typical relative risk reduction of 25%, absolute risk reduction of 15% and NNTB of even). To prevent one death or major disability, as many as 10 infants or as few as five infants would need to be treated. This reduction in death or major disability remains significant in the subgroup analysis for severe encephalopathy (NNTB 7, as many as 17 infants or as few as 4 infants), and for moderate encephalopathy (NNTB 6, as many as 11 infants or as few as 4 infants). In the overall analysis, the effects on each component contributing to the composite outcome (death, major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors, CP, neuromotor delay, developmental delay) were also statistically significant and clinically important. These results are consistent across the seven trials that measured the effect on death or major disability (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Overall, the methodology of the included studies is strong. This is particularly true of the four largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICE-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ICE Study 2011</LINK>) that contributed most of the weight to the pooled analysis.</P>
<P>It is important to note that along with the composite measure of "death or neurodevelopmental disability to 18 to 24 months of age", each component of the measure was decreased with cooling therapy. Among all treated infants, there was a significant reduction in mortality (Outcome 1.2) with a statistically significant decrease in major disability overall and among survivors (Outcomes 1.3 and 1.4). In addition, neuromotor delay, mental developmental delay and CP were significantly reduced (Outcomes 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9) and a borderline reduction in blindness was seen (Outcome 1.10) among survivors treated with hypothermia. Therefore, cooling reduces mortality and, if an infant survives, also decreases the infant's chance of major disability.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses performed in this review included method of cooling, quality of follow-up, degree of baseline encephalopathy and severity of baseline aEEG findings. For the subgroup analysis by method of cooling, both head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia and whole body cooling resulted in a decrease in the composite outcome of death or major disability (Outcome 1.1). However, for the independent outcomes of mortality and major disability, results differed between treatment modalities. While there was no significant decrease in mortality (Outcome 1.2), neuromotor disability (Outcome 1.5) or developmental delay (Outcome 1.6) seen among infants treated with selective head cooling, a significant decrease in these outcomes was seen among infants treated with whole body cooling. For all of these non-significant outcomes in infants treated with head cooling, there was a strong trend towards improvement as compared to control infants. For some safety outcomes as well, statistical significance was achieved for one cooling modality but not another. Thrombocytopenia was significantly increased overall and in infants treated with head cooling (Outcome 1.19), while leukopenia was significantly increased among infants treated with whole body cooling (Outcome 1.18). Infants undergoing whole body cooling were also noted to have significantly decreased hypoglycaemia (Outcome 1.22). However, it is unclear whether these findings represent a true difference between modalities or rather reflect inadequacy of sample size. Given the controversy surrounding the optimal modality of cooling, it is important to emphasise that these findings do not support any significant superiority of either modality. The better method of cooling may remain uncertain until selective head cooling and whole body cooling are directly compared in clinical trials.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by degree of baseline encephalopathy (Comparison 2) included infants with both severe and moderate encephalopathy. For both infants with severe and moderate encephalopathy, there is a significant reduction in death or major disability (Outcome 2.1) and mortality (Outcome 2.2) seen in infants treated with hypothermia. However, infants with severe encephalopathy demonstrated no reduction in major disability, while a significant reduction was seen in infants with moderate encephalopathy (Outcome 2.3). One concern is whether this supports the "death versus disability" question addressed by Barks (<LINK REF="REF-Barks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barks 2008</LINK>), that is, by treating with hypothermia are we preferentially saving those infants with severe injury who might otherwise have died, but instead survive with profound neurological impairment?  It is important to note that these data do not support this controversy. If this were the case, a reduction in mortality among those with severe HIE would be likely to result in either a trend towards increased risk of neurodevelopmental sequelae overall in infants treated with hypothermia or, at a minimum, no difference in the risk of such sequelae. While this meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant reduction in major disability among surviving infants with severe HIE, there was a trend towards improvement (typical RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12) and the lack of significance is likely to reflect the smaller number of infants in this category.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by severity of baseline aEEG findings demonstrated a reduction in death or major disability (Outcome 3.1) among cooled infants with intermediate but not severe aEEG findings at baseline. Given that baseline aEEG findings are used to exclude infants with severe encephalopathy at some centres, it should be noted that there was a strong trend towards reduction in death or major disability among infants with severe aEEG findings at baseline. There was a reduction in major disability (Outcome 3.3) but no significant decrease in mortality (Outcome 3.2) seen in cooled infants with either intermediate or severe aEEG findings. However, these analyses (Outcomes 3.2 and 3.3) included only a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Cool-Cap-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cool Cap Study 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For subgroup analyses by quality of follow-up (Comparison 4), there was a significant reduction in both the primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental disability (Outcome 4.1), in mortality (Outcome 4.2), in major neurodevelopmental disability (Outcome 4.3), in neuromotor delay (BSID PDI &#8805; two SD below mean, Outcome 4.5) for both infants with high-quality and lower-quality follow-up. For developmental delay (BSID MDI &#8805; two SD below mean, Outcome 4.4) significant improvement was seen only in infants with high-quality follow-up. While no significant reduction was seen in infants with lower-quality follow-up, this most likely reflects the inclusion of only a small number of infants from a single trial in this analysis.</P>
<P>Due to limited data, we were not able to perform subgroup analyses according to the duration of hypothermia or according to electrophysiological plus clinical criteria versus clinical criteria alone.</P>
<P>Additional data on neurodevelopmental outcomes reported in this analysis include MRI abnormalities, need for gavage feeds at discharge, seizures during initial hospitalisation, the need for anticonvulsants at follow-up and developmental outcomes at school-age of six to seven years. While the MRI findings represent a consistent pattern of injury as classified by Rutherford 2010 (<LINK REF="STD-TOBY-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TOBY Study 2009</LINK>), the time at completion of MRI varied between studies. Nonetheless, there was a significant reduction in the presence of abnormal findings on MRI (Outcome 1.33). There was also borderline reduction in the presence of seizures during the initial hospitalisation (Outcome 1.31) among infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, but no significant decrease in the number of infants requiring tube feeds at discharge (Outcome 1.30) or with seizures at follow-up (Outcome 1.32). Developmental outcomes at school-age of six to seven years are reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-NICHD-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD Study 2005</LINK>). While there was no significant reduction in death or moderate-to-severe disability at age six to seven years among those treated with hypothermia (Outcome 1.12.1), there was a clinically important trend towards improvement (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.04) and a significant reduction in death at age six to seven years (Outcome 1.12.2). No significant reduction was seen in moderate-to-severe disability (Outcome 1.12.3), blindness (1.12.5), deafness (1.12.6) or seizures (Outcome 1.12.7) at age six to seven years. While the long-term benefit of cooling is currently unknown, the results of this single study suggest that mortality is reduced without any increase in moderate or severe neurosensory disability with more remote follow-up.</P>
<P>Reporting of many of the secondary outcomes specified in our original protocol was not adequate to assess adverse outcomes or safety. While an increase in the incidence of sinus bradycardia and thrombocytopenia were seen in infants treated with hypothermia (as well as an increase in leukopenia and a decrease in hypoglycaemia in infants undergoing whole body cooling), there was no significant effect of hypothermia on other short-term adverse outcomes. While not statistically significant, there was a trend towards increased PPHN among all infants treated with hypothermia that may be clinically important. An additional safety outcome emerging in the literature is the occurrence of subcutaneous fat necrosis as a complication of hypothermia. This was previously reported in infants undergoing hypothermia for cardiovascular surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Chuang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuang 1995</LINK>), but was not noted in clinical trials of therapeutic hypothermia for HIE. Subcutaneous fat necrosis was noted in only one cooled infant in NICHD and unspecified skin changes were noted in one infant in CoolCap. Since the more widespread clinical application of therapeutic hypothermia, a number of case reports of fat necrosis in cooled infants (<LINK REF="REF-Wiadrowski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiadrowski 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oza-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oza 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f3_mez_x002d_Fern_x00e1_ndez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gómez-Fernández 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akcay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akcay 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sivanandan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivanandan 2012</LINK>). In addition, one report from the UK TOBY Cooling Register (<LINK REF="REF-Strohm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohm 2011</LINK>) noted 12 cases in infants treated with hypothermia, representing approximately 1% of infants registered as cooled infants. No similar cases have been reported in infants randomised to standard care, suggesting that hypothermia may be associated with an increased risk of subcutaneous fat necrosis. Interventions to reduce the incidence of this complication, such as that of <LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2012</LINK>, may be beneficial as therapeutic hypothermia becomes more commonplace.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:27:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the overall analyses, the number of infants studied is substantial; the estimates of treatment effect on the primary outcome, death or major neurodevelopmental disability, and on each component of this composite outcome, were reasonably precise. However, these estimates of treatment effect were less precise in subgroup analyses based on severity of encephalopathy and aEEG at baseline, method of cooling and quality of follow-up.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-12-10 15:12:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several limitations of the available evidence should be noted. By clinical necessity, the caregivers could not be blinded to the intervention. Even so, in seven of the eight trials that assessed the effect of cooling on major neurodevelopmental disability, assessors of neurodevelopment were blinded to treatment group assignment. The effect of treatment group on mortality could be biased by the unblinded intervention if it resulted in fewer decisions by caregivers to withdraw intensive care in cooled babies. However, the finding that major neurodevelopmental disability was not increased in survivors who had been cooled does not support this speculation.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:27:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-12-08 17:27:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from the 11 randomised controlled trials (N = 1505) included in this systematic review that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial to term and late preterm newborns with HIE. Death or major disability, mortality, and neurodevelopmental disability in survivors are all reduced. Importantly, mortality is reduced without increasing major disability in survivors. While there is also some evidence of harm from therapeutic hypothermia (increased thrombocytopenia), the benefits of cooling on survival and neurodevelopment outweigh the short-term adverse effects.</P>
<P>Cautious application of the results of this meta-analysis is recommended. Trials contributing participants to this meta-analysis were conducted within strict protocols and often at centres of excellence with considerable experience in therapeutic hypothermia. However, as evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of hypothermia has emerged, a large number of centres have introduced hypothermia as standard treatment, and in 2010 the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommended that therapeutic hypothermia should be offered to term or near-term infants with moderate or severe encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2010</LINK>). While the ILCOR recommended the use of standard inclusion criteria and cooling protocols, as hypothermia has become standard treatment it appears that centres are using less rigorous inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2010</LINK>). These have included both tertiary centres and local hospitals with more limited experience with patient selection and cooling protocols. It remains to be seen if the use of therapeutic hypothermia in less experienced centres or using less rigorous selection criteria, or both, will blunt the efficacy of hypothermia seen here. Additionally, as hypothermia is a significant problem in the developing world, studies are underway to assess the use of hypothermia in low-resource settings (<LINK REF="STD-Bhat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bhat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thayyil-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thayyil 2010</LINK>), and further analyses will need to be conducted to determine the efficacy of hypothermia in these settings.</P>
<P>As the use of hypothermia has become more routine, the difficulty in initiating hypothermia prior to six hours of life has provoked interest in the efficacy of late (after six hours of life) initiation of hypothermia. While animal studies have suggested that cooling is most beneficial when initiated prior to six hours of life (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 1998a</LINK>), studies are now underway (<LINK REF="STD-NICHD_x003a_-Late-Hypothermia" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD: Late Hypothermia</LINK>) to investigate the utility of later hypothermia. In one completed study of late hypothermia (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2009</LINK>), there was a statistically significant reduction in death or disability seen when cooling was started at up to 10 hours of life. However, the utility of such late cooling cannot be determined with the limited data now available. Cooling during transport is often considered as a means to initiate hypothermia in a more timely manner for infants born at referral hospitals where hypothermia is not available. While there is some evidence that controlled hypothermia targeted to core temperature can safely be initiated by dedicated transport teams using strict NICU protocols at referring hospitals and continued during transport (<LINK REF="STD-ICE-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ICE Study 2011</LINK>), reports of transport of infants where either active or passive cooling has been commenced by referring hospitals or on transport have demonstrated that while both active (<LINK REF="REF-Hobson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 2011</LINK>) and passive (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kendall 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 2011</LINK> ) cooling during transport may be effective, difficulty with temperature management (particularly with excessive hypothermia) can occur. Although cooling at the referring hospital of birth, prior to arrival of the transport team, is becoming a widely used practice, its efficacy has not yet been established by any randomised controlled trials, and the possibility of excessive hypothermia must be carefully considered when considering initiating cooling at referring hospitals prior to transport.</P>

<P>Further well-designed and executed studies with appropriate power are required to determine the optimal modality (head versus body), duration (&#8804; 48 hours versus &gt; 48 hours or &gt; 72 hours), and degree (&#8804; 33 °C versus &gt; 33 °C) of hypothermia. While cooling for longer durations or lower temperatures, or both, is currently being studied (<LINK REF="STD-NICHD_x003a_-Optimizing-Cooling" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD: Optimizing Cooling</LINK>), the question of selective head cooling versus whole body cooling remains. Additionally, the application of hypothermia to additional populations of infants at risk for neurological sequelae is being pursued on multiple fronts. This includes preterm infants (32 to 35 weeks' gestation) with a diagnosis of HIE (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh_x003a_-Preterm-Infants" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh: Preterm Infants</LINK>), but also infants being treated with ECMO (<LINK REF="STD-Ichiba-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ichiba 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Horan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NEST-Study" TYPE="STUDY">NEST Study</LINK>) and infants with hyperammonaemia and encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Lichter_x002d_Konecki" TYPE="STUDY">Lichter-Konecki</LINK>).</P>
<P>As hypothermia has become an established therapy for infants with HIE, the use of adjunct therapies has become an increasing focus of study. Trials of xenon have shown promise in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chakkarapani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakkarapani 2010</LINK>), and multiple randomised controlled trials employing xenon in addition to therapeutic hypothermia are underway (<LINK REF="STD-CoolXenon-Study" TYPE="STUDY">CoolXenon Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOBYXe" TYPE="STUDY">TOBYXe</LINK>). Other adjunctive treatments being studied include darbepoetin (<LINK REF="STD-DANCE" TYPE="STUDY">DANCE</LINK>) and topiramate (<LINK REF="STD-NeoNATI" TYPE="STUDY">NeoNATI</LINK>). Both erythropoietin (<LINK REF="REF-Iwai-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwai 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2011</LINK>) and topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Schubert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubert 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noh 2006</LINK>) have previously been found to be effective in animal models of HIE. Additional therapeutic agents for future study as adjunctive therapies with hypothermia include (among others) levetiracetam, N-acetylcysteine and melatonin, all of which have been found to be effective in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Cilio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cilio 2010</LINK>). Studies of the optimal management of seizures in infants with HIE and the effectiveness (or toxicity) of therapeutic agents such as phenobarbital are also needed. In keeping with various government policies (<LINK REF="REF-NHRMC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHRMC 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Washington-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Washington 2011</LINK>), the inclusion of parents and consumers as partners in the design and conduct of new trials and in communication of their results may enhance several aspects of future research (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnow_x002d_Mordi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnow-Mordi 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Modifications were made to the protocol in both the <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK> and <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>. For the Objectives, the inclusion criteria were modified to exclude infants &lt; 35 weeks' gestation and cooling initiated after six hours. These modifications were made in order to streamline the review as data emerge on cooling in infants &lt; 35 weeks' gestation and who undergo later cooling and to improve generalisability of results. As such, the Objectives were modified to remove the category "Inclusion criteria: term or late preterm (&#8805; 35 weeks' gestation) infants versus more preterm (&lt; 35 weeks' gestation)" and the Methods section "Types of participants" was modified to include infants "35 weeks' gestation or greater." It is well-described in animal models that the effectiveness of hypothermia is dramatically reduced when initiated after six hours of life (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>), although studies are emerging (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2009</LINK>) exploring the use of late hypothermia. As data emerge in this field, it is felt that this will warrant a separate review. Therefore, the Objectives were modified to remove the category "Timing of commencement of intervention (&lt; three hours versus three to six hours versus more than six hours)". The Methods section "Types of interventions" was modified to include cooling initiated prior to six hours after birth. Given that infants undergoing head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia may have relatively higher core temperatures but lower intranasal and scalp temperatures than infants treated with whole body cooling, it is difficult to compare temperatures in these treatment modalities in a meaningful way. Therefore, the Objectives were modified to remove "Degree of cooling (core temperature &#8804; 34.5 °C versus &gt; 34.5 °C)." In addition, Objective 1 (Severity of HIE) was modified to include both clinical staging of encephalopathy and staging based on baseline aEEG findings.</P>
<P>Additional changes to the Methods included clarification of definitions for secondary outcomes, additions to secondary outcomes and changes in the pre-specified outcomes reported. Definitions were clarified for "Any coagulopathy" and "Renal impairment." The outcome "Seizure" was modified to include both seizures during the initial hospitalisation and at follow-up. Three additional outcomes were added, as they were felt to be clinically important.  These were 'outcome at six to seven years,' 'hepatic dysfunction,' and 'persistent pulmonary hypertension,' which also included the outcome 'requiring inhaled NO.  For 'outcome at six to seven years,' both mortality and multiple neurodevelopmental findings are reported. Additionally, the outcome 'days to sucking feeds' was modified to the more binary 'need for gavage feeds at time of discharge. The outcome 'diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) on early MRI (&lt; day 4)' and 'basal ganglia, posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) and/or white matter (WM) injury, parasagittal neuronal necrosis on late MRI (&gt; day 4) were replaced with 'MRI abnormalities (moderate or severe abnormalities in the basal ganglia or thalamus, severe white matter lesions or abnormalities in the posterior limb of the internal capsule).' </P>
