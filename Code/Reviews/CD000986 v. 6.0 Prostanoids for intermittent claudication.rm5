<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:34:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of lower limb ischaemia that results from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is evident as muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue) in the leg muscles that occurs during exercise and is relieved by a short period of rest. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostacyclin (PGI2), also known as prostanoids, are vasoactive drugs used in PAD to reduce arterial insufficiency. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of prostanoids in patients with IC. We identified 18 randomised studies with a total of 2773 participants, of which four studies compared the effects of PGE1 versus placebo. Overall, there was insufficient high quality evidence to suggest that PGE1 improves walking distances in people with IC. There was also a lack of evidence to determine if PGE1 was more effective than laevadosin, naftidrofuryl or L-arginine. Evidence on the efficacy of prostacyclin was inconclusive. Results suggest that, compared with PGE1, prostacyclin may be associated with an increased occurrence of side effects including headache, diarrhoea and facial flushing.</P>

<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common cause of morbidity in the general population. While numerous studies have established the efficacy of prostanoids in PAD stages III and IV, the question of the role of prostanoids as an alternative or additive treatment in patients suffering from intermittent claudication (PAD II) has not yet been clearly answered. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:12:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update,<I> </I>the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2013) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. In addition, reference lists of relevant articles were checked.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-27 12:05:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised clinical trials of prostanoids versus placebo or alternative ('control') treatment in people with intermittent claudication were considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:13:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes included pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and maximum walking distance (MWD), presented as mean change in walking distance during the course of the trial (% improvement) and as final walking distance (that is walking distance, in metres, after treatment) for the prostanoid and control groups.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:26:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen trials with a total of 2773 patients were included (16 in the original review and a further two in this update). As the majority of trials did not report standard deviations for the primary PFWD and MWD outcomes, it was often not possible to test for the statistical significance of any improvements in walking distance between groups. The quality of individual trials was variable and usually unclear due to insufficient reporting information. Comparison between trials was hampered by the use of different treadmill testing protocols, including different walking speeds and gradients. Such limitations in the data and the trial heterogeneity meant it was not possible to meaningfully pool results by meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Four trials compared prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) with placebo; individual trials showed significant increases in walking distances with administration of PGE1 and in several trials the walking capacity remained increased after termination of treatment. Compared with pentoxifylline, PGE1 was associated with a higher final PFWD and MWD but these results were based on final walking distances rather than changes in walking distance from baseline. When PGE1 was compared with other treatments including laevadosin, naftidrofuryl and L-arginine, improvements in walking distances over time were observed for both PGE1 and the alternative treatment, but it was not possible from the data available to analyse statistically whether or not one treatment was more effective than the other.</P>
<P>Six studies compared various preparations of prostacyclins (PGI2) with placebo. In one study using three different dosages of iloprost, PFWD and MWD appeared to increase in a dose-dependent manner; iloprost was associated with headache, pain, nausea and diarrhoea, leading to a higher rate of treatment withdrawal. Of three studies using beraprost sodium, one showed an improvement in PFWD and MWD compared with placebo while two showed no significant benefit. Beraprost sodium was associated with an increased incidence of drug-related adverse events. Of two studies on taprostene, the results of one in particular must be interpreted with caution due to an imbalance in walking capacity at baseline.</P>
<P>Comprehensive, high quality data on outcomes such as quality of life, ankle brachial index, venous occlusion plethysmography and haemorrheological parameters were lacking.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:29:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst results from some individual studies suggested a beneficial effect of PGE1, the quality of these studies and of the overall evidence available is insufficient to determine whether or not patients with intermittent claudication derive clinically meaningful benefit from the administration of prostanoids. Further well-conducted randomised, double blinded trials with a sufficient number of participants to provide statistical power are required to answer this question.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-12 13:13:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-12 13:13:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important cause of morbidity in the general population, and intermittent claudication (IC) is the primary symptom of lower limb ischaemia. IC is usually caused by haemodynamically significant lesions of the aortoiliac, femoropopliteal or infrapopliteal vessels. IC is a clinical diagnosis given for muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue) in the leg muscles, which occurs during exercise and is relieved by a short period of rest. Functional independence is threatened in people with IC due to limitations on mobility. A survey by The Scottish Vascular Audit Group reported that claudicants had a significantly impaired quality of life in all respects, from general health, pain, vitality and social parameters to mental and emotional wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Pell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pell 1995</LINK>). IC may progress to critical limb ischaemia (CLI), causing constant and intractable pain preventing sleep and is often associated with ulceration and gangrene of the foot. Ultimately, IC can lead to limb loss, surgical revascularisation, cardiovascular disease and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1999</LINK>). Recent figures published in the Scottish Health Survey showed that the prevalence of symptomatic disease increases with age, affecting approximately 1.7% of people aged 16 to 54 years up to 7.4% in those aged &gt; 75 years (<LINK REF="REF-The-Scottish-Health-Survey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Scottish Health Survey 2010</LINK>). Over a 16-year period from 1991 to 2007, there were 41,953 new admissions for PAD in Scottish hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Inglis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inglis 2012</LINK>). Results of follow-up studies of patients with IC have demonstrated that approximately 20% will experience a worsening of symptoms during two to seven years of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>). Of those that progress to CLI, approximately 50% of patients die within five years of presenting with symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2005</LINK>). The cost of treating CLI in the UK has been estimated at over £200 million per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Beard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beard 2000</LINK>). The five-year cumulative incidence of amputation is low (about 1%). However, IC is a marker of generalised atherosclerosis and therefore an indicator associated with increased risk of premature death (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:51:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most patients with stable IC are managed conservatively (<LINK REF="REF-Coffman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coffman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1993</LINK>). There are two main objectives of therapy: a) to retard the rate of progression of atherosclerosis, and b) to diminish the arterial insufficiency and thereby to treat the symptoms. Reduction of risk factors for progression of disease is the mainstay of the conservative medical management. Antithrombotic therapy with antiplatelet agents, especially aspirin, can lower the incidence of associated cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the majority of patients with IC are not at high risk of limb loss, the primary therapeutic goal is to improve exercise performance and the functional status of the patients. Exercise training has been demonstrated to be a very effective therapy to improve claudication-limiting physical activity in patients with PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 2000</LINK>). However, there are data that suggest that, due to restrictions in training ability or poor compliance, only 30% of all patients with IC benefit from physical training (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Haye-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Haye 1992</LINK>). Therefore, as an alternative or additive treatment, pharmacologic measures with so called vasoactive drugs may be applied.</P>
<P>Compared with exercise training, the place of vasoactive drugs such as prostaglandins, pentoxifylline, naftidrofuryl, cilostazol or buflomedil in the management of patients suffering from IC is less clear. Analysis of numerous publications on the efficacy of these vasoactive substances has shown that in the majority of studies, methodological errors and inaccuracies with regard to patient selection, investigative methods and statistical evaluation were evident (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heidrich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidrich 1992</LINK>). However, a few studies have been published indicating a favourable effect of these drugs on the microcirculation or haemorrheological parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Brande-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Brande 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostacyclin (PGI2) have been used for the treatment of PAD for more than two decades. PGE1 is rapidly inactivated during passage through the lungs and therefore has to be given either intra-arterially or in large intravenous doses (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK>). While intra-arterial application was recommended initially, intravenous infusions of PGE1 are nowadays preferred. PGI2 is a very potent but chemically unstable and short-lived compound and thus has limited clinical use. Therefore more stable analogues such as iloprost, beraprost, taprostene or ciprostene, with similar pharmacodynamic profiles, have been developed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-11 02:54:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The direct vasodilatory properties and subsequent changes in blood flow and antiplatelet activity are generally regarded as the most important effects of PGE1 and other prostanoids (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheffler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheffler 1991</LINK>). However, many other pharmacological effects have been described that seem to be responsible for clinical efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). The demonstrated effects of prostanoids include inhibition of neutrophilic activation and release of toxic oxygen radicals from activated leukocytes (white blood cells); reduction of adhesion of monocytes and macrophages; antiproliferative activity on vascular smooth muscle cells; reduction of extracellular matrix formation; an inhibitory action on platelet function; increase in fibrinolytic activity; influence on lipid metabolism; reduction of vascular cholesterol content; improvement of oxygen and glucose metabolism; and an influence on rheological parameters by increased erythrocyte (red blood cell) deformability.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-03-11 03:21:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After early enthusiasm for preliminary clinical findings, a more critical opinion concerning the clinical value of PGE1 and PGI2 has developed. There is now convincing evidence that PGE1 and iloprost, administered by intermittent daily intravenous infusions, are effective in patients with CLI (<LINK REF="REF-Verstraete-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraete 1994</LINK>), and they are therefore recommended in such patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2000</LINK>). While the use of prostanoids in the management of severe symptomatic peripheral ischaemia (a condition for which no alternative drug therapy exists) can be recommended, it is still unknown whether patients with IC might benefit from this treatment. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004.</P>

<P>Two review authors (AA, LR) independently assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The risk of bias tool provides a strict protocol to assess allocation (selection bias), blinding (performance bias and detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other potential sources of bias. For each of the six domains, we assessed the risk of bias as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' of bias, with unclear risk of bias indicating that there was insufficient information available to permit an assessment of either low or high risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two review authors.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-03-11 03:52:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to pool the data on the PFWD and the MWD from each trial to arrive at an overall estimate of the effectiveness of the pharmacological interventions. We aimed to calculate the percentage change in the walking distance during the course of the trial and then, where possible, calculate the mean difference in the prostanoid group compared with the control group. For continuous outcomes such as PFWD and MWD, statistical analysis was presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we used odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI. However, few studies presented the standard deviations (SD) of the walking distances and therefore it was seldom possible to analyse the mean difference in change in walking distance from baseline to follow up between the treatment and control groups. Therefore the final walking distance, that is the walking distance at the end of treatment (in metres), was also presented and pooled, where possible. There are obvious limitations in presenting differences in final walking distances between treatment and control groups, the main one being that this does not take into account any differences in walking distances between the two groups at baseline, that is before treatment. Furthermore, the relationship between treadmill speed and walking distance is not linear but is also influenced by the gradient of the treadmill. Individual studies used a range of speeds and gradients for treadmill testing; and while these measures were converted into final walking distances in metres, it could be argued that the walking distance on a gradient of 7 ° would be different to the walking distance on a gradient of 10 °. Converting these results into a standard measure of final walking distance in metres is likely to result in significant heterogeneity when pooling the studies. Nevertheless, it was decided to use all available data in order to make the analysis as complete as possible.</P>

<P>All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. When the individual trials did not use intention-to-treat analyses, the analyses in this review were on the basis of the data (absolute numbers) provided in the included trial report. The statistical appropriateness of combining the trials was based on tests of heterogeneity, which consider whether differences in treatment effect over individual trials are consistent with natural variation around a constant effect. We assessed trial heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). Where heterogeneity was identified (P &lt; 0.1, or I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%), we investigated the reason for heterogeneity. If no apparent reason was found, we conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis to incorporate heterogeneity among trials. In the absence of heterogeneity we used a fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blume-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blume 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>), with a total of 300 participants (152 PGE1 group and 148 placebo group), analysed the effects of PGE1 versus placebo. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Blume-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blume 1986</LINK>) with 50 participants (25 PGE1 group and 25 placebo group) investigated the effects of intra-arterial (ia) infusions on PFWD and MWD. After three weeks of treatment, the mean PFWD improved by 109% (59 m) in PGE1 patients compared to 35% (19 m) in placebo patients, while the mean MWD improved by 74% (72 m) and 18% (17 m) in the two treatment groups respectively. Based on final walking distances, the PFWD improved by 40 m (95% CI 13.42 to 66.58 m, P = 0.003) and MWD by 56 m (95% CI 20.45 to 91.55 m, P = 0.002) in patients treated with intra-arterial PGE1 compared to a placebo.</P>
<P>The two remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>) measured the effects of intravenous (iv) infusions. Both studies measured the PFWD and MWD after four weeks of treatment and individual results showed significant improvements in patients treated with PGE1. <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK> examined 208 patients (106 PGE1 and 102 placebo) and estimated that after four weeks of treatment PGE1 improved the PFWD by 75% compared to 43% with the placebo, while MWD improved by 65% with PGE1 compared to 42% with the placebo. Standard deviations around the mean differences were not presented and therefore significance levels could not be assessed. Based on final walking distances and compared to a placebo, PGE1 improved PFWD and MWD by 17.2 m (95% CI 16.68 to 17.72 m) and 21.1 m (95% CI 20.62 to 21.58 m), respectively. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK> was much smaller with only 42 patients (21 in each group) and, after four weeks of treatment, the PFWD improved by 87.5% compared to 4% in the placebo group, and MWD improved by 90% compared to 1% in the placebo group. Significance levels could not be assessed as standard deviations around the differences were not presented in this publication. Based on final walking distances, PGE1 was associated with an increase in PFWD of 51 m (95% CI 35.12 to 66.88 m) while the MWD was 112 m (95% CI 80.67 to 143.33 m) compared to placebo. However, results based on final walking distances must be interpreted with caution as they do not take into account the change from baseline. In this study (<LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>), baseline walking distances were not comparable between the treatment groups: the PFWD was 9 m less and the MWD was 12 m less in PGE1 patients compared to the placebo controls. In this study, reporting final walking distances alone led to an under-reporting on the improvement in PFWD and MWD with PGE1. The two studies could not be combined in a meta-analysis as they were deemed too heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 97%).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK> also administered treatment for eight weeks and measured walking distances at this time point. After an initial treatment period of four weeks with PGE1 or placebo administered five days a week, an interval treatment period of four weeks was applied where treatment was reduced to bi-weekly. After this four-week interval, and eight weeks after treatment first commenced, the mean PFWD in PGE1 patients improved by 100% from baseline compared to 60% in the placebo group. Using final walking distance to estimate improvement, the PFWD was increased by 22.30 m (95% CI 21.74 to 22.86 m) with PGE1 (P &lt; 0.001). At the same time point, MWD improved by 88% compared to 61% in the PGE1 and placebo groups respectively. Compared with placebo, PGE1 led to an improvement of 25.8 m (95% CI 25.27 to 26.33 m) in MWD (P &lt; 0.001). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK> also measured walking distance at eight weeks although treatment was administered for only four weeks. This study was not included in a meta-analysis as the study authors did not report the PFWD and MWD at eight weeks in the placebo group. Attempts were made to retrieve this information from the author but we were unsuccessful. Mean PFWD increased by 57% (41 m) while the mean MWD improved by 64% (89 m) from baseline in the PGE1 group. Data on walking distances at eight weeks in the placebo group were not presented.</P>
<P>A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK>) analysed the PGE1 prodrug AS-013 (59 participants) versus placebo (21 participants) but it could not be included in our analysis because the data were reported in medians rather than means. Those who received PGE1 were split into three groups according to dosing schedule: 2 µg five days a week (n = 19), 5 µg two days a week (n = 18) and 5 µg five days a week (n = 22). The authors only reported walking distances for the highest dose group. At four weeks, there was no significant difference in the median improvement of PFWD between the PGE1 group (20 m, interquartile range (IQR) 33 m) and the placebo group (9 m, IQR 18 m) (P &gt; 0.05). However, the study authors reported a significant difference between the PGE1 group (28 m, IQR 81 m) and the placebo group (4 m, IQR 20 m) (P &lt; 0.05) in the improvement of the MWD. At eight weeks, the median PFWD increased by 20.9 m (IQR 43 m) in PGE1 patients but did not improve in placebo patients (0 m, IQR 29 m) (P &lt; 0.01) while the median MWD improved by 35 m (IQR 68 m) but decreased by 11.2 m (IQR 35 m) in the PGE1 and placebo groups respectively (P &lt; 0.01). However, PFWD and MWD at baseline were not comparable between the placebo and PGE1 patients and thus the results should be interpreted with caution. </P>

<P>Quality of life was measured in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK> used two methods, the walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ) which specifically assesses changes in walking capacity in response to treatment of IC and the RAND 36-Item health Survey, which is a generic tool designed to measure health-related quality of life. After four weeks of treatment, analysis of the WIQ demonstrated significant improvements in the walking impairment, distance, speed and stair climbing scores (all P &lt; 0.001) while the RAND survey showed improvements in physical function (P &lt; 0.001) and bodily pain scores (P &lt; 0.01). At the end of the eight-week treatment-free follow up, all WIQ and RAND scores were still increased compared with baseline (P &lt; 0.01). <LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK> used an 8-point questionnaire to determine quality of life and concluded that, overall, patients given a placebo deteriorated by a score of 64 points while those administered the PGE1 prodrug AS-013 improved by a score of 22 to 73 points, with the most marked difference being observed in physical functioning and leisure activities.</P>

<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luk_x0027_Janov-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luk'Janov 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>) analysed iv PGE1 versus iv pentoxifylline. Although the mean difference in walking distance could be calculated for each study, the SDs for the mean differences were not reported and therefore the studies could not be pooled in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK> conducted a study on 195 patients (97 PGE1, 98 pentoxifylline). Results showed that administration of PGE1 and pentoxifylline significantly increased the PFWD by 218% (83 m to 264 m) and 124% (84 m to 188 m), respectively, and the MWD by 164% (130 m to 343 m) and 146% (131 m to 322 m), respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Luk_x0027_Janov-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luk'Janov 1995</LINK> measured the PFWD only and reported a significant improvement in PFWD of 119% (89 m to 195 m) in the PGE1 group (n = 42) and 91% (78 m to 149 m) in the pentoxifylline group (n = 40). It was not clear at what time point this was measured and this could not be clarified by the study authors. Meanwhile <LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK> showed that, after four weeks of treatment, PFWD increased with both PGE1 (396%) and pentoxifylline (113%), while MWD improved by 260% in 63 PGE1 patients and 118% in 60 pentoxifylline-treated patients. Based on final walking distances and compared to pentoxifylline, PGE1 was associated with an improvement in PFWD of 212 m (95% CI 130 to 294 m) while MWD increased by 192 m (95% CI 95 to 289 m). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK> comprised 45 patients, 15 received PGE1, 15 pentoxifylline, and 15 underwent physical exercise alone. Four weeks after treatment, the mean PFWD had increased by 119% in the exercise group (72 m to 158 m), 105% in the pentoxifylline group (75 m to 154 m) and 604% in the PGE1 group (81 m to 570 m). Compared to pentoxifylline, PGE1 was associated with an increase in PFWD of 416 m (95% CI 27.7 to 804.3 m). Mean MWD also increased by 99% (131 m to 261 m), 119% (160 m to 350 m) and 371% (158 m to 744 m ) in the physical exercise, pentoxifylline and PGE1 groups respectively. Final MWD was improved by 393 m (95% CI -32.5 to 818.5 m) in favour of PGE1. Forty-four patients were followed up for one year and a reduction in PFWD was observed, with the extent of deterioration differing by treatment. In both the exercise and pentoxifylline groups, the symptomatic walking distance remained at just 30% above pretreatment distance while the PGE1 patients still showed a 149% increase in PFWD.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>) that reported SDs for final walking distances were combined in a meta-analysis as low heterogeneity was determined (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 2% and 0% for PFWD and MWD respectively). Combining these two studies (77 PGE1 and 75 pentoxifylline patients) and based on final walking distances, PGE1 was associated with a significant improvement in PFWD (221 m, 95% CI 141 to 300 m, P &lt; 0.001) and MWD (202 m, 95% CI 107 to 297 m, P &lt; 0.001).</P>

In contrast, 84 patients were given a placebo. Data on PFWD and MWD were presented as mean percentage changes from baseline to follow up. At six months, PFWD improved by 3.3% in the placebo group compared to 7.7%, 8.8% and 11.2% in the iloprost 50 µg, 100 µg and 150 µg groups respectively, while MWD improved by 3.2%, 7.1%, 13.7% and 25.7% in the placebo and three iloprost groups respectively.

All three studies administered a 120 µg dose of BPS; <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK> administered treatment for 12 weeks, <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 2000</LINK> administered treatment for six months, while the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK> administered treatment for one year. Walking distances at 12 weeks were used in order to make the results comparable but data from other time points were also reported. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK> could not be included in a meta-analysis as the study authors only provided log-transformed values without SDs. <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK> reported baseline PWFD and MWD and presented results as percentage change from baseline to follow up. As the SDs for the percentage change were presented, it was possible to conduct statistical analysis on this study. Results showed that while BPS was associated with an improvement in PFWD, it was not statistically significant (MD 56%, 95% CI -13% to 126%). The same was true for MWD, which improved by 99% and 61% in the two groups respectively (MD 38%, 95% CI -23% to 99%). These results were supported by <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>, who reported that BPS was not more effective than placebo in the improvement of walking distances at 12, 18 and 24 weeks (all P &gt; 0.05). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK> also reported change in walking distance in metres but as they did not present SDs for the final distances it was not possible to include this study in a meta-analysis based on final walking distance.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK> also administered doses of 60 µg and 180 µg of BPS daily. BPS administered at a dose of 60 µg improved PFWD by 129% (SD 210%) compared with placebo (58% (SD 107%)) but the improvement was not statistically significant (MD 76%, 95% CI -0.4% to 142%). The MWD increased by 142% (SD 318%) and 61% (SD 92%) in the BPS 60 µg and placebo groups respectively, but again this improvement was not statistically significant (MD 81%, 95% CI -19% to 181%). At a higher dose of 180 µg, PFWD was improved by 51% (SD 114%) compared to 58% (SD 107%) with placebo (MD -7%, 95% CI -56% to 41%) while MWD was improved by 69% (SD 133%) and 61% (SD 92%) in the BPS 180 µg and placebo groups respectively (MD 8%, 95% CI -42% to 58%).</P>

For the purpose of this review, the walking times were converted into metres. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1989</LINK> evaluated taprostene versus placebo in 30 participants (15 taprostene and 15 placebo). Analysis of the data suggested that taprostene was not as effective as a placebo in improving PFWD (MD -9 m, 95% CI -12 to -6 m) but it is important to note that the baseline walking distance was higher in the placebo group. Taprostene was associated with an increase in MWD of 11 m (95% CI 0 to 22 m) but again the baseline MWD was higher in the placebo group, thus suggesting that the effect of taprostene was greater than as reported in the analysis. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1990</LINK>, 54 patients were randomised to PGI2 and 54 were given a placebo. The baseline PFWD and MWD were comparable between the two treatment groups. Although walking distances appeared to improved with taprostene, this was not to a statistically significant degree (PFWD MD 6 m, 95% CI -9 to 22 m; MWD MD 18 m, 95% CI -11 m to 48 m).</P>

In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Creager-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Creager 2008</LINK> one patient in the placebo group died but there were no major amputations. The rate of revascularisation was 5.7%, 5.8% and 1.1% in the iloprost 50 µg, 100 µg and 150 µg groups respectively, compared to 6% in the placebo group. Headache was reported in 44%, 64% and 67% of the iloprost 50 µg, 100 µg and 150 µg groups compared to 16% of placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of flushing between the two treatments (5% iloprost versus 4% placebo). Pain in the extremity, jaw pain, nausea and diarrhoea occurred more frequently in the iloprost group compared to placebo. Cardiovasular events occurred at a similar rate between the two groups. The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study medications was two to three-fold higher in the iloprost groups than with placebo (31%, 57% and 53% for 50 µg, 100 µg and 150 µg iloprost groups respectively, compared to 14% in the placebo group). <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK> reported five cases of myocardial infarction and four cardiovascular deaths in the placebo group and one cardiovascular death in the BPS group.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>One death occurred in the pentoxifylline group (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0 to 2.71). Revascularisation rates were similar between the two treatment groups, both when all iloprost doses were combined (OR 1.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 5.09) and when the three doses were compared individually (50 µg twice-daily OR 2.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 13.57; 100 µg twice-daily OR 2.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 13.74; 150 µg twice-daily OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.49). No major amputations occurred in this study. Headache was reported in 44% of patients receiving iloprost 50 µg twice-daily, in 64% of those receiving iloprost 100 µg twice-daily and in 67% of those receiving 150 µg twice-daily, compared to 19% of patients treated with pentoxifylline. Additionally, while the frequency of flushing was comparable between the pentoxifylline (2%) and iloprost 50 µg twice-daily (5%) groups, it increased in a dose-respondent manner to 23% in patients receiving 100 µg twice-daily and 31% in patients receiving 150 µg twice-daily iloprost. Furthermore, diarrhoea occurred more often in iloprost-treated patients (13%) than pentoxifylline-treated patients (6%). On the other hand, mild dyspepsia occurred at twice the frequency in patients receiving pentoxifylline (13%) compared to those receiving 50 to 100 µg iloprost twice-daily (6%). The occurrence of adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 31%, 57% and 53% of the twice-daily 50 µg, 100 µg and 150 µg iloprost groups respectively, compared to 15% of the pentoxifylline group.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_B_x00fc_hl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Bühl 1987</LINK>) compared iv iloprost (11 participants) versus iv hydroxyl-ethyl starch (HES) (12 participants). At the end of a two-week treatment period, PFWD improved by 36.5 m (59%) in PGI2 patients compared to 17.9 m (31%) in HES patients while the corresponding improvements in MWD were 50.2 m (49%) and 44.6 m (45%) in the two treatment groups respectively. The improvements in final PFWD (22 m, 95% CI -8.9 m to 53.3 m) and final MWD (7.4 m, 95% CI -49.8 m to 64.6 m) were not statistically significant.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-11 06:44:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed 18 randomised controlled trials studying the clinical effectiveness of prostanoids in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-11 06:30:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of some individual studies included in this review suggested that PGE1 improved walking capacity in patients with IC. Five studies reported that walking capacity even continued to increase after termination of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creutzig-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Creutzig 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>) suggested that PGE1 is beneficial as an addition to physical training and leads to a greater improvement in walking distances than with exercise alone. However, the quality of the studies is variable and the individual results could not be strengthened by pooled analysis. Therefore, the overall evidence is insufficient to determine whether or not patients with IC derive clinically meaningful benefit from administration of PGE1. Data concerning the effects of beraprost sodium are conflicting with one study reporting an increase in walking distances while two studies demonstrated it had no significant effect. Results from individual trials also suggested that walking distances improved in a dose-dependent manner with iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue (PGI2). However iloprost was also associated with an increased incidence of drug-related adverse events, particularly at higher doses. Pentoxifylline may be a useful alternative as it was associated with an improvement in walking distances, but it did not produce fewer drug-related side effects than PGI2.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-03-11 06:37:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search identified studies of the majority of well-known treatments for IC, including prostaglandin, pentoxifylline and PGI2. However, studies on cilostazol were not identified in the completed searches.</P>
<P>Three studies provided no information about participants' characteristics (especially risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, for example smoking habits, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or diabetes mellitus) and therefore a potential heterogeneity between the study groups that may influence the final results could not be rated (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luk_x0027_Janov-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luk'Janov 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_B_x00fc_hl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Bühl 1987</LINK>). The additional effect of vascular training could not be included in our analysis because only eight studies clearly mentioned this important part of therapy, and described a daily, controlled or supervised training for all randomised groups (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_ger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Böger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creutzig-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Creutzig 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>). The remaining studies provided no information concerning the start or continuation of a training program. It is possible that the lack of this important information could have influenced our final results. Three studies did not mention whether other vasoactive or antiplatelet drugs were continued during the study (<LINK REF="STD-Blume-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blume 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_B_x00fc_hl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Bühl 1987</LINK>). The possible administration of these drugs could have lead to false positive results and should therefore should be considered in the interpretation of this publication.</P>
<P>The major problem of our review was the limited comparability of the included studies, as our analyses revealed a significant heterogeneity between the studies. Additionally, different study designs have to be considered in the interpretation of the included studies used; the duration of administration and therefore the total dosages of the study drugs differed significantly between the studies. In addition, different walking treadmills were used to determine walking distances, with gradients ranging from 5 ° to 12 ° and walking speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 3.5 km/h. Due to the difference in treadmill testing, results were not always comparable. For example, it would be expected that a patient walking at a slower speed or on a lower gradient would be able to walk further than a patient walking at a faster speed or a higher gradient. Therefore, final walking distance is not always a true indication of the effectiveness of treatment but is also influenced by the speed and gradient of the treadmill. Ideally all studies would use a standardised protocol to measure walking distances. However this was not the case. To be as complete as possible, final walking distances were converted regardless of the treadmill test but the review authors did so knowing that this would introduce heterogeneity between individual studies. Seventeen of the 18 included studies used a constant load test and one used a graded test (<LINK REF="STD-Creager-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Creager 2008</LINK>). Authors of this study did not present final walking distances but rather a percentage change from baseline. Without the final walking distance and standard deviations, it was not possible to convert the results of the graded test to make them comparable with a constant load test. However, as this study was not included in a meta-analysis, it had no effect on the overall result. Most of the studies enrolled only a small number of participants and therefore their statistical power appears low, generating a considerable beta-error. Additional statistical problems occurred in the analysis of 15 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blume-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blume 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_ger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Böger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creager-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Creager 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creutzig-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Creutzig 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luk_x0027_Janov-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luk'Janov 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_B_x00fc_hl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Bühl 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>) because the standard deviations of the results were missing and therefore significance levels could not be assessed.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-11 06:39:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A restriction of this review was that the majority of studies did not provide enough information to permit a judgement on the risk of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting biases. Attempts were made to contact authors for more information but only one author (<LINK REF="STD-Milio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Milio 2006</LINK>) responded with the required information. The major problem was the lack of information about methods of randomisation and blinding, and the number of withdrawals and dropouts. In addition, several methodological errors of the published data were evident. In five studies baseline values of walking distances were determined by a single measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Luk_x0027_Janov-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luk'Janov 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_B_x00fc_hl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Bühl 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1990</LINK>). This could have generated false results because the remaining studies observed variations of walking distances in several participants of more than 20% between two measurements (performed in the pre-treatment period) and excluded these patients from participation in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blume-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blume 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_ger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Böger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creager-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Creager 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creutzig-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Creutzig 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hepp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li_x00e8_vre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lièvre 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangiafico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mangiafico 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheffler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scheffler 1994</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-11 06:42:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review we identified all the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared prostanoids to a placebo or control treatment. Open or cohort studies were not included because prostanoids are a well studied drug over a long period of time, and there is a significant number of RCTs available. We believe our search for RCTs has been inclusive and it is unlikely that our standardised methods of study selection and data extraction could have introduced bias. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, lack of standard deviations reported in the publications and the variable presentation of the outcomes by the trialists, we did not pool all the available data. This is likely to have resulted in the conclusion of this review being less robust.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virgolini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Virgolini 1990</LINK>) presented walking distances in seconds. In order to make these results comparable with other studies, we converted the walking times in seconds to walking distances in metres using the gradient and speed reported by the authors. While this may have introduced some bias into the review, we considered that not including the data would have introduced even more bias.<B>
<I> </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Due to the lack of data presented in studies, it was not possible to account for background exercise and treadmill testing. Variations in exercise levels prior to participating in the study may have introduced bias into the results. However as authors of the studies did not clarify this, there was no way to assess the level of bias.</P>
<P>In most cases we presented final walking distances instead of the percentage change in walking distance because of a lack of standard deviations reported in the original publications. There are obvious limitations in presenting final walking distances, the main one being that the final value does not take into account the change from baseline. Furthermore, variations in treadmill testing meant that walking distances were not always comparable between individual studies, and this is likely to result in significant heterogeneity when pooling the studies. Nevertheless it was decided to use all available data in order to make the analysis as complete as possible.</P>

<P>To date, no systematic review has examined the effect of prostanoids on intermittent claudication (IC). Three systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frampton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frampton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salhiyyah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salhiyyah 2012</LINK>) have measured the effectiveness of pentoxifylline on improving walking distance in IC. A greater improvement in PFWD and TWD has been shown for pentoxifylline-treated patients compared with placebo. However, the studies were poor quality and the large degree of heterogeneity between them resulted in the reviews concluding that the overall clinical effect of pentoxifylline was unclear. One review (<LINK REF="REF-Ruffolo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruffolo 2010</LINK>) measured the effectiveness of prostanoids in treating critical limb ischaemia (CLI) and, while there were some positive results regarding rest pain relief, ulcer healing and amputations, the reviewers determined that there was no conclusive evidence on the long-term effectiveness and safety of different prostanoids in patients with CLI.</P>

<P>Further well-conducted randomised double blinded trials that include a sufficient number of participants to provide statistical power should be performed to overcome methodological errors evident in the published literature. Standardised, supervised vascular training performed by a control group during study and follow-up phases should be compared with the administration of prostanoids. Studies investigating the additional effects of prostanoids during exercise should only compare groups which perform the same training program in order to provide clear data. Concomitant vasoactive therapy should not be administered. Study drug dosage and the administration regime should follow manufacturers' recommendations and standardised treadmill tests should determine walking distances. To analyse long-term effects of prostanoids, based on the published literature, we recommend a follow up of at least one year. The following outcome parameters should be considered: (1) pain-free and maximal walking distance by standardised treadmill test; (2) ABI; (3) occurrence of amputation and vascular surgery; (4) drug side effects; and (5) quality of life. A cost-effectiveness analysis would also be informative.</P>
