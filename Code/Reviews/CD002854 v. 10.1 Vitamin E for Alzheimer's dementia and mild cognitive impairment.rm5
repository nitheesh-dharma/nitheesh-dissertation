<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:27:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Vitamin E is found in a variety of foods, including vegetable oils and fats, nuts and seeds. Some animal and non-interventional studies have suggested it might have a role in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence has linked vitamin E with potentially serious side effects and even an increased risk of death. In this review, we looked for evidence about the effect of vitamin E on people who had either dementia due to AD or milder problems with memory or thinking (mild cognitive impairment or MCI). People with MCI have an increased risk of developing dementia.</P>
<P>
<B>Included trials</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for clinical trials published up to April 2016 which had randomly allocated people with dementia due to AD or with MCI to treatment with vitamin E supplements or a placebo (pretend treatment). We found three trials that investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with AD, but we could extract data from only one of these trials (304 participants). We found only one trial with 516 participants which investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with MCI. The quality of these two trials was generally good.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>Vitamin E did not reduce the number of people with MCI who developed dementia over three years. We also found no evidence that vitamin E improved cognition (e.g. learning and memory) in people with MCI or with dementia due to AD. One trial found that people with dementia due to AD who took vitamin E could manage daily activities (e.g. bathing and dressing) better than people who took placebo. There was no evidence from these trials that vitamin E caused significant harm to participants, but these types of trials are not the best way to look for harmful effects unless the effects are very common. Because all the results came from single trials, it is likely that further research could lead to different conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>From limited evidence, we found nothing to suggest that there are either benefits or harms from vitamin E supplements. As the quality of evidence was only moderate, further trials are needed to confirm the findings. It is possible that different types or doses of vitamin E might have different effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-20 14:33:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Vitamin E occurs naturally in the diet. It has several biological activities, including functioning as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals. Evidence that free radicals may contribute to the pathological processes behind cognitive impairment has led to interest in the use of vitamin E supplements to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2006 and 2012.<BR/>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-17 15:34:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials met the inclusion criteria, but we could only extract outcome data in accordance with our protocol from two trials, one in an AD population (n = 304) and one in an MCI population (n = 516). Both trials had an overall low to unclear risk of bias. It was not possible to pool data across studies owing to a lack of comparable outcome measures.</P>
<P>In people with AD, we found no evidence of any clinically important effect of vitamin E on cognition, measured with change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) over six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) -1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.75 to 0.13, P = 0.07, 1 study, n = 272; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between vitamin E and placebo groups in the risk of experiencing at least one serious adverse event over six to 48 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, P = 0.13, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence), or in the risk of death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, P = 0.46, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence). People with AD receiving vitamin E showed less functional decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory than people receiving placebo at six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) 3.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.23, P = 0.04, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of any clinically important effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -1.47, 95% CI -4.26 to 1.32, P = 0.30, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>We found no evidence that vitamin E affected the probability of progression from MCI to probable dementia due to AD over 36 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35, P = 0.81, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). Five deaths occurred in each of the vitamin E and placebo groups over the 36 months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.44, P = 0.99, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). We were unable to extract data in accordance with the review protocol for other outcomes. However, the study authors found no evidence that vitamin E differed from placebo in its effect on cognitive function, global severity or activities of daily living . There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the more commonly reported adverse events.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-17 15:34:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no evidence that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E given to people with MCI prevents progression to dementia, or that it improves cognitive function in people with MCI or dementia due to AD. However, there is moderate quality evidence from a single study that it may slow functional decline in AD. Vitamin E was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality in the trials in this review. These conclusions have changed since the previous update, however they are still based on small numbers of trials and participants and further research is quite likely to affect the results.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-17 15:22:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:27:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:27:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition in which people develop deficits in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language and executive functioning, as well as a variety of emotional and behavioural symptoms. This leads to progressive functional impairment. AD causes huge emotional and financial burden to people, carers, and health and social care systems. Current treatments for AD have limited efficacy and cannot prevent progression of the condition. It is projected that 5.2% of the world's population will have dementia by 2050, equating to a worldwide prevalence of 131.5 million cases (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition of cognitive deficits which are not accompanied by significant impairment in the performance of activities of daily living and hence do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia. People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Ganguli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganguli 2011</LINK>), although this is not considered inevitable (<LINK REF="REF-Bruscoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruscoli 2004</LINK>). In 2011, it was estimated that between 10% and 20% of people over the age of 65 years meet criteria for MCI (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:27:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of eight naturally occurring, fat-soluble chemical derivatives of tocopherol and tocotrienol. It occurs naturally in a variety of food substances including vegetable oils and fats, and in nuts and seeds, such as almonds and sunflower seeds. Alpha-tocopherol is the most commonly studied compound and it has been the only form of vitamin E used in clinical trials in AD. According to the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (US), the recommended daily allowance for men and women over 14 years of age is 22.4 IU (15 mg of alpha-tocopherol) (<LINK REF="REF-National-Academy-of-Sciences-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Academy of Sciences 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin E has a number of biological activities which vary with the form of vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Boccardi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boccardi 2016</LINK>). One of its functions is to act as a scavenger of free radicals by working as an antioxidant (<LINK REF="REF-Uneri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uneri 2006</LINK>). Oxygen free radicals contain oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons and are highly reactive, damaging proteins, DNA and cell membranes unless rapidly 'quenched' by antioxidants. They are produced as by-products of the body's metabolism as well as by radiation. As vitamin E is lipophilic, it can protect cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins from peroxyl radicals, which react preferentially with vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Traber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traber 2011</LINK>). In particular, vitamin E is thought to inhibit the process of lipid peroxidation, which damages the polyunsaturated fatty acids essential to the integrity of cell membranes. Vitamin E's activity in protecting against the harmful effects of free radicals may be measured indirectly by assessing the state of the antioxidant-oxidant system. Endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione provide an indication of the antioxidant status while the oxidised form of glutathione, glutathione disulphide (GSSG), and malondialdehyde (MDA) may provide an indication of the oxidative stress status and in particular lipid peroxidation.</P>
<P>High doses of vitamin E (over 3000 IU/day) are considered toxic, and have been implicated in a variety of symptoms including fatigue, gastrointestinal cramps and diarrhoea. Further, there is an increasing body of evidence that vitamin E supplementation can cause adverse effects, even at lower doses. For example, vitamin E increases bleeding tendency and can potentiate the effect of aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 1995</LINK>). One meta-analysis found that vitamin E supplementation, while reducing risk of ischaemic stroke by 10%, increased the risk of haemorrhagic stroke by 22% (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_rks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schürks 2010</LINK>). Evidence from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) suggests that daily supplementation with vitamin E 400 IU in healthy men may significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2011</LINK>), and there is evidence from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial that vitamin E supplementation increases the risk of heart failure and hospitalisation for heart failure in people over 55 years of age with diabetes mellitus and vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lonn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonn 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK> carried out a meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials testing vitamin E alone or in combination with other supplements. The median dose of vitamin E in these trials was 400 IU/day although the maximum dose was up to 2000 IU/day. The authors reported a statistically significant dose-dependent relationship between vitamin E intake and all-cause mortality. One Cochrane meta-analysis also found that vitamin E given singly or combined with other antioxidants significantly increased mortality in 26 trials (risk ratio (RR) 1.04) (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2010</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-20 16:25:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>There are both theoretical arguments and empirical findings to suggest that free radical damage may be one of the mechanisms causing neuronal degeneration in a range of conditions including ageing, MCI and AD. This evidence was summarised by <LINK REF="REF-Grundman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundman 2000</LINK>. Many studies have found evidence of increased level of oxidative damage to neurons and mitochondrial DNA in AD and MCI (<LINK REF="REF-Butterfield-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterfield 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hensley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mecocci-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecocci 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mecocci-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecocci 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>). Antioxidants, including vitamin E, improve cognitive functioning of aged rodents (<LINK REF="REF-Socci-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socci 1995</LINK>), and protect against the effects of brain ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hara-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hara 1990</LINK>) and of some neurotoxins (<LINK REF="REF-Wortwein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wortwein 1994</LINK>). Transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein, implicated in AD, showed accelerated age-associated brain degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Hsiao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsiao 1995</LINK>). Vitamin E can delay this deterioration (<LINK REF="REF-Behl-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behl 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koppal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koppal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 1996</LINK>), and decrease oxidative DNA damage (<LINK REF="REF-Boothby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boothby 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Central nervous tissue contains a high proportion of fatty material (lipid), and since vitamin E is fat-soluble it can readily enter the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Vatassery-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vatassery 1988</LINK>). In older-adult population-based studies, there have been reports of an association between low blood levels of vitamin E and impaired cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Cherubini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherubini 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrig-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrig 1997</LINK>). Mean levels of vitamin E in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of people with AD were reported to be lower than normal in several reports (<LINK REF="REF-Jeandel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeandel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jimenez_x002d_Jimenez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jimenez-Jimenez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polidori-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polidori 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tohgi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tohgi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaman 1992</LINK>), though not in all (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlskog-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlskog 1995</LINK>). Lower levels of both forms of vitamin E - tocotrienols and tocopherols - have been observed in the plasma of people with AD and MCI (<LINK REF="REF-Mangialasche-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangialasche 2012</LINK>). However, lower levels of vitamin E in AD may be a consequence of the disease rather than a cause of it, due in part to an overall decreased general dietary intake especially as the disease advances (<LINK REF="REF-Tabet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results from clinical trials of vitamin E in non-AD neurodegenerative disorders have not been promising. For example, neither people with Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Parkinson_x0027_s-SG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkinson's SG 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pham 2005</LINK>) nor Huntington's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Peyser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peyser 1995</LINK>) have shown a significant overall benefit from vitamin E supplementation. In this review, we focused specifically on the role of vitamin E in the treatment of AD and MCI.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-20 09:10:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>It is estimated that 46.8 million people worldwide have a diagnosis of dementia, and this is predicted to rise to 131.5 million cases by 2050 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=715499091710332585&amp;versionPK1=z1210121332597483750137640631974&amp;versionPK2=z1511251250040647842844344156435#REF-Prince-2015">Prince 2015</A>), with AD being the most prevalent subtype. At present, there is no effective treatment for MCI or for dementia due to AD. Vitamin E continues to be used by some people as a non-prescription supplement mainly because of its widely reported antioxidant properties and some previous positive findings. However, due to the potential health risks of taking vitamin E, it is important to determine whether vitamin E is an effective treatment of AD and MCI. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review, which was originally published in 2000 and was last updated in 2012. This review involved an updated search of the literature as well as changes to the conclusion, which better reflect emerging findings from vitamin E clinical trials in AD.</P>

For binary data, the data extracted was the number of participants with each outcome in each treatment group at each time point. For ordinal data, there were two possible approaches. If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested that parametric tests were appropriate, then ewe treated the outcome measures as continuous data. The second approach, which may not exclude the first, was to concatenate into two categories that best represent the contrasting states of interest, and to treat the variable as binary.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease</HEADING>
<P>The primary purpose of the first treatment study was to determine whether alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), selegiline (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) or a combination of the two agents would slow the clinical deterioration associated with AD (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=715499091710332585&amp;versionPK1=z1210121332597483750137640631974&amp;versionPK2=z1511251250040647842844344156435#STD-Sano-1996">Sano 1996</A>). There were four groups: placebo, vitamin E (2000 IU total daily dose divided into two doses), selegiline and selegiline plus vitamin E. The study recruited 341 participants with a diagnosis of probable AD dementia of moderate severity (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1988</LINK>)) from 23 centres in the US. We considered only the placebo (n = 84) and vitamin E (n = 85) groups in this review. Assessments were conducted one month after enrolment and at three-monthly intervals for two years. The primary outcome was the survival time to any one of four end points; death, institutionalisation, change in severity of dementia to a CDR of three or loss of two basic activities of daily living. After the primary end point was reached, every effort was made to continue further assessment of the secondary outcomes if possible. The secondary outcomes were the Cognitive section of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Blessed-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessed 1968</LINK>), the Dependence Scale (DS) (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1994</LINK>), the Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia (BRSD) (<LINK REF="REF-Tariot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tariot 1995</LINK>), and adverse events. The primary analysis compared survival to end point for each of the three treatment groups in comparison with the placebo group, using Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank tests with no correction for other factors or variables, and the Cox proportional hazards model including covariates. A small number of participants were lost to follow-up without having reached a primary end point (placebo 6/84, vitamin E 8/85).</P>
<P>The purpose of the second treatment study was to explore the effects of vitamin E on AD progression and markers of oxidative stress (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=715499091710332585&amp;versionPK1=z1210121332597483750137640631974&amp;versionPK2=z1511251250040647842844344156435#STD-Lloret-2009">Lloret 2009</A>). Vitamin E 800 IU or placebo was given daily for six months. There were 57 participants diagnosed with probable AD. All AD participants were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor and were not taking any other antioxidant medication. Assessments were conducted on the first day of enrolment and after six months. Oxidative stress was assessed in two ways. The first method used blood concentrations of the oxidised glutathione molecule, GSSG, with greater levels indicating greater oxidative stress. GSSG was also assessed as a ratio with the antioxidant molecule, glutathione. The second method measured the blood marker MDA as a marker of lipid peroxidation, which is a strong indicator of oxidative damage. AD progression was measured by the Clock Drawing Test (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 1989</LINK>), the BDS and MMSE. The primary analysis was to compare performance on the cognitive tasks in relation to the effects of vitamin E on oxidative stress. The effects of vitamin E on oxidative stress markers were investigated using a Mann-Whitney test to compare GSSG and MDA values at the beginning and the end of the study in both the placebo and active treatment groups. Vitamin E-treated participants were divided into responders and non-responders according to whether vitamin E was effective or not in reducing markers of oxidative stress. The responder, non-responder and placebo group means were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparison between groups was also undertaken following removal of participants with cerebrovascular disease. To determine the effect of modifying oxidative stress on cognitive performance, the relationship between MMSE change and GSSG change in participants treated with vitamin E was assessed using Spearman's coefficient of correlation. We contacted two authors of the <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=715499091710332585&amp;versionPK1=z1210121332597483750137640631974&amp;versionPK2=z1511251250040647842844344156435#STD-Lloret-2009">Lloret 2009</A> study for additional information, but following an initial response from one author, we received no additional responses.</P>
<P>The purpose of the third treatment study was to determine if alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), memantine, or both slowed the progression of mild to moderate AD (<LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK>). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial (RCT), 613 people with mild to moderate AD were randomly assigned to one of four groups: alpha tocopherol (2000 IU total daily divided into two doses), memantine 20 mg/day, alpha tocopherol plus memantine or placebo. We considered only the placebo (n = 152) and vitamin E (n = 152) groups in this review. All participants were recruited in the US and had a diagnosis of possible or probable AD of mild to moderate severity, as defined by a MMSE score between 12 and 26. Duration of treatment ranged from six months to four years and participants were assessed every six months. The primary outcome was the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale (<LINK REF="REF-Galasko-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 2006</LINK>). Secondary outcomes were the ADAS-Cog, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>), the Caregiver Activity Survey (CAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>), the DS and adverse events. Participants and their carers were asked specifically about participant falls, syncope and congestive heart failure as these were linked to high-dose alpha tocopherol in previous trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lonn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>). Serious adverse events were coded on the basis of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A longitudinal repeated-measure mixed-effects model adjusted for medical centre as a random effect and for baseline ADCS-ADL.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prevention of progression of cognitive impairment</HEADING>
<P>The primary purpose of the single MCI study was to determine whether treatment with vitamin E 2000 IU/day or donepezil in people with the amnestic form of MCI decreased the conversion rate into dementia due to AD (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK>). There were three treatment groups: vitamin E, donepezil and placebo. All participants were also taking a multivitamin. This review included the vitamin E and the placebo groups only. Out of 769 participants enrolled from 69 sites in the US and Canada, 516 received either placebo or vitamin E. The secondary outcomes were scores on various measures: the MMSE (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1603091745176301345482343907844&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Folstein-1975">Folstein 1975</A>), ADAS-Cog (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1603091745176301345482343907844&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Rosen-1984">Rosen 1984</A>), CDR (Sum of Boxes), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Mild Cognitive Impairment Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-MCI-ADL) scale, the Global Deterioration Scale, a neuropsychological battery and adverse events.

<P>The relevant primary analysis in the paper used the Cox proportional hazards model to determine whether there was a significant reduction in time to progression to AD among participants treated with vitamin E compared with participants given placebo. Participants were included on an ITT basis. Several baseline variables were included in the analysis as covariates. The secondary outcomes were examined using analysis of covariance for the change in scores without correction for multiple comparisons. Missing values were imputed using a projection method considered appropriate for assessing responses among people with neurodegenerative diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Aisen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aisen 2003</LINK>).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> reported the number in each outcome group who reached one of their primary end points (death, institutionalisation, change in severity of dementia to a CDR score of three or loss of two basic activities of daily living) within two years; this was 45/85 (53%) of participants in the vitamin E group and 58/84 (69%) in the placebo group. Because the trial was limited in time, an analysis comparing a count of events without taking into account their timing is less precise than the survival analysis reported by <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>. Using Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank testing in their primary analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> found no significant difference in survival time to one of the four end points between the vitamin E and placebo groups (RR 0.70, no CI reported; P = 0.08). However, the study groups differed in baseline MMSE scores and these were correlated with clinical course. The vitamin E group began with a mean MMSE of 11.3 (SD 5.7) and the placebo group with a mean MMSE of 13.3 (SD 4.9). When the analysis was repeated using the Cox proportional hazards model and controlling for baseline MMSE, there emerged a significant difference favouring vitamin E (RR 0.47, no CI reported; P = 0.001).</P>
<P>The primary outcomes reported by <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK> were the percentage change in performance from baseline to six months on the BDS, Clock Drawing Test and MMSE, compared across responders (n = 9), non-responders (n = 10) and placebo-treated groups (n = 14), where participants who showed a decrease in GSSG values of more than 10 nmol/mL of blood after six months of vitamin E treatment were termed 'responders' and participants who did not were termed 'non-responders'. We found no evidence that these groups had been defined before data collection. The authors reported no significant difference between groups on the Clock Drawing Test or BDS in an analysis of 'completers' only. The MMSE score increased in the responder group but decreased in the placebo group and more so in the non-responders. There was a significant difference between the two vitamin E-treated groups on MMSE change score (P &lt; 0.05). The responders did not differ significantly from the placebo-treated group.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-17 15:22:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for this review. To our knowledge there are currently no relevant ongoing trials. Three studies assessed the efficacy of vitamin E in people with AD (<LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>), while one study assessed vitamin E in people with MCI (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK>). A significant limitation of this review is that synthesis of data from the AD studies was not possible owing to different outcome measures, heterogeneity in designs and the inability to access relevant data sets from authors' reports. The <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK> study used a dose of vitamin E of 800 IU/day in the intervention group while the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK> used a dose of vitamin E of 2000 IU/day. Participants in the <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1603091745176301345482343907844&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Sano-1996">Sano 1996</A> study withdrew from the study once they reached a series of clinical end points. We could use data only from the <LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK> studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin E for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease</HEADING>
<P>We found no evidence from the one study from which we could extract data that vitamin E was efficacious in improving cognitive outcomes in dementia due to AD (<LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK>). We could not extract data from <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>For our other primary outcomes, adverse events and deaths, there was no evidence that participants with AD receiving vitamin E were more at risk than participants receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>). From this review, we were unable to comment on the safety or tolerability of higher doses of alpha-tocopherol or of other tocopherol and tocotrienol forms. In what appeared to be a post hoc analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK> reported that the subgroup of participants with AD who responded to vitamin E with a reduction in measures of oxidative stress had similar cognitive outcomes to participants taking placebo, while participants showing no reduction in oxidative stress measures in response to vitamin E had significantly poorer cognitive outcomes. This was very low quality evidence due to the post hoc definition of response, the small sample size and other significant methodological limitations, but the apparent accelerated decline in cognitive abilities in those participants in whom vitamin E did not reduce oxidative stress measures suggests a need for caution in future trials.</P>
<P>Among our secondary outcomes, we could extract data from <LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK> on behavioural disturbance, which did not differ between groups, and on performance of activities of daily living, which declined less over a mean follow-up of 2.27 years in the vitamin E than in the placebo group. We were unable to extract any data on our secondary outcomes of global dementia severity, mood, carer burden, quality of life, physical disability or institutionalisation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin E for <I>m</I>ild cognitive impairment</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK> was the only study identified that investigated the effects of vitamin E on the progression from MCI to AD. We found no evidence that vitamin E treatment affected the risk of progression to AD over 36 months compared to placebo. The evidence presented by <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK> also suggests that vitamin E was not efficacious in improving cognitive outcomes in MCI.</P>
<P>There was no evidence that vitamin E treatment increased the risk of death, and while we were unable to extract data for adverse events, the data presented by the authors indicated that the risk of adverse events also did not differ between treatment groups. As with the AD sample, we were unable to comment on the safety or tolerability of higher doses of alpha-tocopherol or of other tocopherol and tocotrienol forms in an MCI population.</P>
<P>Among our secondary outcomes, we were unable to analyse data on activities of daily living and global severity because sample sizes were not clearly reported. However, the data presented by the authors showed no evidence that either outcome benefited from vitamin E treatment compared to placebo. The study did not measure mood, carer burden, quality of life, physical disability or institutionalisation, so we could not draw any conclusions about the effect of vitamin E on these outcomes in an MCI population.</P>

<P>The review was based on a small number of RCTs that were heterogeneous in design thus preventing a meta-analysis. Notably, no two studies included in this review had the same primary outcome, while only a single study investigated vitamin E treatment in a MCI population (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2005</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-16 13:35:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using the GRADE approach, we rated the overall quality of evidence for all outcomes to be moderate. We considered the studies from which we extracted data to be at low to unclear risk of bias. However, we downgraded all quality judgements one level due to imprecision because all data came from single modest-sized studies and we therefore considered it likely that further research could have an impact on the effect estimates.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-20 16:32:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To minimise the possibility of bias, we tried to locate all RCTs by a broad and comprehensive search strategy in a number of databases. We sought additional information from the authors of one study but were unable to obtain it (<LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK>). The review was limited by our inability to obtain or extract the data we needed from two of the included studies.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-20 16:33:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Habitual intake of dietary antioxidants has not consistently been found to improve cognitive performance or reduce the risk of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Crichton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crichton 2013</LINK>). While vitamin E assessed in epidemiological studies in relation to cognition has consisted of the various naturally occurring forms (<LINK REF="REF-Engelhart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelhart 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2005</LINK>), the relationship between vitamin E and cognition is unclear. In the present systematic review, there was no evidence that vitamin E improved either cognition or risk of developing AD. <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2005</LINK> suggested that the combined intake of tocopherols is likely to be more important than alpha-tocopherol alone. This is further supported by <LINK REF="REF-Mangialasche-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangialasche 2010</LINK> who studied the relationship between cognitive impairment and the eight individual forms of vitamin E and concluded that any potential neuroprotective effect for vitamin E may result from interaction of the various forms.</P>
<P>It has been previously reported that vitamin E, especially in the large doses used in the included studies, may be associated with potentially significant adverse effects and even an increased rate of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK>). High doses of alpha-tocopherol also have the potential to induce enzymes involved in drug metabolism with an associated risk of serious interactions with some concomitant medication (<LINK REF="REF-Brigelius_x002d_Floh_x00e9_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigelius-Flohé 2007</LINK>). However, this review found no evidence that vitamin E treatment significantly affected the number of serious adverse events or deaths, although the relatively short study lengths and small sample sizes mean that no strong conclusions about the safety of vitamin E can be drawn from these data.</P>

<P>This review found little evidence for the efficacy of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found no evidence that it affects cognition, although there was moderate quality evidence from one study that it may slow functional decline, changing our conclusions from the previous update. However, based upon the quality of evidence, it is likely that further trials could have an impact on this finding. We consider it important to inform patients, carers and professionals about the lack of evidence for efficacy and the potential hazards of using vitamin E in AD. It should be noted that the conclusions are based only on the alpha-tocopherol formulation of vitamin E, and hence no comment can be made on the efficacy of other preparations.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-20 14:46:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant and plays an important role in protecting cells against the harmful effects of free radicals. There is sufficient evidence from laboratory and animal studies to consider it of potential interest as a treatment for people with AD. Overall, however, there continues to be a paucity of randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of vitamin E in AD. The findings from <LINK REF="STD-Dysken-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dysken 2014</LINK> are interesting and indicate that vitamin E may slow functional decline in AD. Further research is now warranted to assess this further. Additional research is also needed to explore the effects of vitamin E treatment on other clinically relevant outcomes, such as quality of life, which was not assessed in any of the trials identified in this review. This review is a good example of the need to have more uniform outcomes across trials, with a focus on identifying outcomes that are meaningful to patients and carers. <LINK REF="STD-Lloret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lloret 2009</LINK> was a small study, but interesting as it showed a harmful effect on cognition in those participants whose oxidative stress markers did not respond to vitamin E intake. However, the size and high number of dropouts in this study limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Other studies included in this review did not measure antioxidant or nutritional levels prior to randomisation. The assessment of oxidative stress markers in future trials should be considered in order to understand further the oxidant-antioxidant balance in relation to vitamin E effects in AD. In addition, the exclusive use of the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E in clinical trials has been criticised. Future studies should investigate other tocopherol and tocotrienol forms. We will consider investigating subgroups by vitamin E formulation and oxidative stress response in future updates of this review.</P>
