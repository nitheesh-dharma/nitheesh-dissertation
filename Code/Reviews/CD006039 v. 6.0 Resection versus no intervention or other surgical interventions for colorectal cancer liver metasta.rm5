<P>Almost half of patients with colorectal cancer develop metastases many of which are located in the liver, and a quarter of which may be amendable to surgery. If all disease is removed these patients have a 30% to 50% chance of survival at five years.<BR/>Treatment options include surgical removal of the diseased section of the liver as well as other modalities such as cryosurgery and radiofrequency thermal ablation. Although new treatments allow safe destruction of liver metastases, often without the need for major surgery, there are still no clear guidelines on the appropriate management of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Only one low quality study which reported improved disease-free survival in patients who underwent cryosurgery compared with conventional techniques, was included in this review.</P>
<P>There is very limited evidence to support the effectiveness or otherwise of a single approach, either surgical resection or other surgical procedure for the management of colorectal liver metastases. Further research is required to evaluate the effects of these treatment options and their role in increasing disease-free survival and in decreasing recurrence. Treatment decisions should continue to be based on individual circumstances and clinician's experience.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-08 06:02:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is highest in the industrialised countries.<B> </B>In 2005 it was estimated that more than 150,000 persons in the US would develop CRC, a third of whom would eventually die of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Am-Cancer-Soc-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Am Cancer Soc 2005</LINK>).<BR/>The risk for developing CRC increases with age such that 90% of all colorectal cancers are diagnosed in people over the age of 50, and 50% of patients are over 70 years at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Yoon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 1999</LINK>). A diet rich in fat and cholesterol, inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative colitis), and a genetic predisposition which includes hereditary polyposis and nonpolyposis syndromes are said to be risk factors. Treatment of CRC is by surgical resection which may be combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Over half of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases, of which 15% to 25% will have liver metastases at the time of primary diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Yoon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 1999</LINK>). More than 50% of patients who die of CRC have liver metastases at autopsy, and the majority die as a result of their metastatic liver disease. It is generally considered unethical not to offer surgery for resectable disease, consequently there are no randomized studies assessing outcome following resection compared with no treatment or other therapeutic modalities in patients with known resectable liver metastases. New treatment options are available that allow safe ablation of liver metastases without the need for surgical intervention.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-10 13:04:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>
<B>Hepatic resection of liver metastases</B>
</I>
<BR/>Out of the 25% of patients with CRC who have liver metastases, between 10% and 25% are candidates for surgical resection. The five-year survival rate following resection of isolated colorectal cancer liver metastases can be as high as 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Stang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stang 2009</LINK>). Liver metastases can be resected with at least a 1-cm<B> </B>tumour-free<B> </B>margin and it is generally accepted that up to 75% of the liver can be removed without subsequent hepatic failure (<LINK REF="REF-Vauthey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vauthey 1998</LINK>). The indications for surgery may now include previously nonresectable cases largely due to the efficacy of chemotherapy to downstage tumour disease and to the use of a combination of conventional resection with adjuvant techniques such as cryotherapy or radiofrequency. It has been reported that four or more metastases, "might be considered [a] contraindication to hepatic resection" (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1988</LINK>), however the only absolute contraindications to resection are the presence of extrahepatic metastases and tumors that are larger than 10 cm in diameter.<BR/>A number of patients who undergo resection of CRC liver metastases may subsequently have a recurrence of their cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Fong-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1997</LINK>), however because surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment, repeated liver resection for CRC metastasis may be justified in certain circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_Trigo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez-Trigo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fong-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffith-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffith 1990</LINK>). Of those metastases which recur, 30% are confined to the liver which allows for repeated resections and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 20 to 30%. Resection within these subset groups may provide better long term control and survival of hepatic metastatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-McLoughin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLoughin 2006</LINK>). Several retrospective studies have examined the survival rate of patients with untreated but potentially resectable CRC liver metastases, however these results should be interpreted with caution in view of their retrospective analysis and relatively insensitive methods for assessment of the extent of the disease.<BR/>A recent report (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2010</LINK>) indicated that resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases may improve long-term survival and there is some evidence that those patients who undergo a complete resection have a five year survival rate of between 25% and 40% and at 10 years of 22% to 23% (<LINK REF="REF-McLoughin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLoughin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Tumour ablation using cryosurgery and radiofrequency thermal ablation</B>
</I>
<BR/>Ablation techniques to treat metastatic tumours in the liver have been used extensively for more than 10 years. Hepatic cryosurgery has been used more frequently than other types of<B> </B>tumor<B> </B>ablation techniques. The process<I> </I>involves freezing and thawing of liver tumours by means of a cryoprobe inserted into the tumuor. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation involves the insertion, under ultrasonic or CT guidance, of an electrode into the centre of<B> </B>tumour which then generates extreme heat and leads to coagulative necrosis of the treated tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Yoon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otto-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otto 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-10 07:28:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Recent studies indicate that tumour ablation therapy can lead to improved survival in appropriately selected patients with hepatic metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Gillams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillams 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stang 2009</LINK>). Assessment of the long-term survival benefit of patients receiving ablative therapy and a comparison of its efficacy to that of surgical resection is an important issue in the management of hepatic metastasis. There is therefore a need to develop clear guidelines on the appropriate management of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Garden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garden 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>The electronic searches retrieved 531 citations (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and Science Database). After examination of the titles and abstracts of these references, all but four studies were eliminated and excluded from further review. Full text copies of these remaining studies were obtained and subjected to further evaluation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2006</LINK>) was a systematic review of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of liver tumors, two papers were critical reviews of the literature; of long term survival after cryosurgery for metastatic colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Tandan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tandan 1997</LINK>), and of surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases (<LINK REF="STD-Memon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2001</LINK>). The bibliographic references of these reviews were examined and no additional randomized controlled trials that were relevant to this research question or that matched our inclusion criteria were found. Finally only one trial which met most of our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Korpan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Korpan 1997</LINK>) was included in this review.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methods</HEADING>
<P>This was a randomized controlled trial conducted from 1983 to 1992 in the Department of General Surgery of the State Medical University of Kiev (Ukraine) which is a specialised surgical center for liver, bile duct and pancreatic diseases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants and setting</HEADING>
<P>A total of 123 (87 male, 36 female) participants aged 41.3 ± 12.1 years (range 34-83 years) were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria specified that all participants should have a solitary metastasis or multiple nodules in either or both lobes of the liver. In 82 (66.6%) of the participants the liver metastases were from primary colorectal cancers, whereas in the remainder of the participants the primary tumours were melanoma or had originated from the stomach, breast, uterus, pancreas and intestine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Participants were randomized to either cryogenic surgery or conventional surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Cryogenic surgery</B>
</P>
<P>Cryoresection was carried out after preliminary freezing of the tumor margin using a cryogenic clamp which delivered liquid nitrogen via a cryosurgical system (Cryoelectronic-2 or Cryoelectronic-4). Resection was completed after the incision line had been completely frozen. Cryoextirpation (cryoablation) and cryodestruction, consisting of two or three freeze-thaw cycles for periods of between 7 and 32 minutes, were carried out by disc shaped probes varying in size from 5 to 55 mm which were applied over an area of 40 cm<SUP>3</SUP> to 180 cm<SUP>3</SUP>.The hepatic cryosurgical procedures consisted of cryoextirpation (29 patients, 46%), cryoresection (20 patients, 32%), and cryodestruction (14 patients, 22%).</P>
<P>
<B>Conventional surgery</B>
</P>
<P>Standard surgical procedures; i.e. wedge resection of the metastases, lobectomy or bi- or trisegmentectomy of the liver were carried out.<BR/>Postoperative treatment for participants in both groups included systemic chemotherapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-10 12:54:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the fact that they were underpowered and not randomised the findings from several earlier studies have changed the clinical approach to patients with colorectal liver metastases. Even with newer therapies, the 5 year survival rate of patients with non-surgically treated hepatic metastases is low in contrast to those patients who undergo a complete resection.</P>
<P>Whilst surgical resection of the liver remains the gold standard for colorectal liver metastases, it is acknowledged that factors such as tumour number, size and location (particularly in some of the more inaccessible and unresectable sites) may mean a large number of patients who would otherwise be unsuitable candidates for surgical resection may actually be eligible for alternative options such as local ablative techniques.</P>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-07-08 07:15:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Resection of colorectal cancer hepatic metastases should be considered in patients with low operative risk provided that complete resection is possible, however the lack of reliable evidence for the effectiveness of surgical resection of liver metastases versus other modalities of intervention is limiting.</P>

<P>Strident attempts were made to limit bias in the review process by ensuring a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies. The authors&#8217; independent assessments of eligibility of studies for inclusion in this review and the extraction of data minimised the potential for additional bias beyond that detailed in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>' section of the review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-10 12:54:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we were unable to find a prospective randomized controlled trial that compared resection with non-surgical resection of liver metastases, a systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Memon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2001</LINK>) reported that there is a distinct, albeit small, subset of patients who might benefit from surgical resection in terms of longer survival. However, in addition to the potential for substantial intra and post operative complications and the increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical resection, successful outcomes for this subset of patients may also be dependent on the accessibility and feasibility of complete excision of all demonstrable tumor to clear surgical margins.<BR/>The electronic searches also identified a literature review (<LINK REF="STD-Tandan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tandan 1997</LINK>) which, although it did not find any relevant randomized controlled trials, reported that based on the results of several case series cryosurgery may offer some advantages over surgical resection for colorectal liver metastases but that the current data did not appear to support its use for resectable disease outside a clinical trial. A further systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2006</LINK>) noted that although the use of radiofrequency ablation might extend the surgical spectrum for treatment of colorectal liver metastases, there was a lack of evidence based on randomized controlled trials that might support either the efficacy or safety of radiofrequency ablation. A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Stang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stang 2009</LINK>) indicated that RFA does offer an alternative option to surgical resection in the treatment of early colorectal liver metastases and should be viewed as a useful adjunct to surgery and chemotherapy but in well selected patients with unresectable disease. An evidence-based review (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2010</LINK>) confirmed wide variation in the reported 5 year survival and recurrence rate after RFA and that there was a compelling need for further research.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-09 06:58:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>This review demonstrates that there is currently insufficient high level evidence to support the effectiveness or otherwise of a single approach, either surgical or non-surgical for the management of colorectal liver metastases. Until more robust evidence is available treatment decisions should continue to be based on individual circumstances, clinician's experience whilst taking into account the guidance provided by more recent guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2010</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-10 12:56:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Local ablative therapies are probably useful, but they need to be further evaluated in adequately powered and well designed randomized controlled trials. However, there are some concerns regarding the ethics of conducting further prospective randomized trials for this clinical question. It is important that future trials should be robust, well designed and reported according to the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>, and account for scientific confounders including the number, size and location of lesion. Any new trials evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions should be conducted objectively and with long-term patient focused outcomes (mortality and survival) (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2010</LINK>).</P>
