Why do you think the lack of a protocol is a serious threat to the excluded new trials?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: minor alterations in red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: ditto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Levels of aminophylline as sub-group. Was this post hoc or pre-specified in the protocol? I note that only Carter was an in-patient trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL:181104&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Andy,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the attached. I have marked all changes in red underline in the review. I have seen to the comments below and I have added a few more bits to the review. In particular please note the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strauss did not stipulate BD response as an entry criterion. I think that this may explain the heterogeneity on some outcomes. Pts were excluded if they had a Wood-Downes clinical score above 5 and all pts in PICU. This could mean that the sample was more mixed and less severe than on the other studies where failure to respond to BD is an entry critierion. I have written this up in abstract, description of studies, results and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have re-visited the data for these studies. In some instances the effect estimates for individual studies do not match the publsied effect estimates. One e.g. is the symptom score for Yung 1998 - what was in RevMan and what was in the published paper were different; not in terms of the mean difference, but in terms of the precision of the effect estimate. I have revised the SDs for the symptom scores in RevMan to match the 95% CI around the effect estimate from the published source. This has removed the heterogeneity for this outcome (I square 0%), and this leaves a significant difference in favour of aminophylline @ 6-8 hours. I have revised the text accordingly. In the discussion I have also added some detail on the censored nature of data in paed studies where a subset of children are able to perform spirometry. Nuhoglu study provides IPD for PEF - these have been added to the change in PEF scores, but the metric altered to SMD as they are in L/min and not % predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added text to the discussion to relate the findings of the Yung trial in to the BTS guidelines. I have also re-written the abstract so it comes in under 400 words. There is still some discussion of baseline here, but ultimately that might be better placed in sections of the review where elaboration is appropriate (Description of Studies, Discussion and Conclusions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;161104&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby and Francine,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks for your help and support. I have amended the review according to Francine's comments in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS&lt;br&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;1. Ream did not have a placebo group: it is not eligible for inclusion unless you change the protocol to include &amp;quot;non placebo but controlled&amp;quot; trials and state very clearly why the protocol was changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Action: Ream removed from included study to excluded study list as no placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;2. We can't use Ream and Yung for the outcome 27 because patients were on mechanical ventilation prior to randomisation. Exposure cannot become an outcome. The only thing you might want to do if stratified on mechanical ventilation (or PICU) for other outcomes such as length of stay. This has implications for several sections - results - graph, results-text, discussion, interpretation, future studies and abstract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Action: Ream removed as no placebo group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENERAL COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Spell Check - carried out&lt;br&gt;2. Units included (% predicted FEV1 does not have a litre value as it is divided by litres in the denominator)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINOR COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. ABSTRACT&lt;br&gt;a. Add description of the patients and setting -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;ADDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. DATA ANALYSIS&lt;br&gt;a. Clarify for 1st subgroup analyses 1. baseline severity of asthma - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;BASELINE&amp;quot; ADDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Although you can't analyze them, it would be nice to present the data on the main outcome subgrouped on each of the 4 planned subgroup analyses either visually in metaview or in the text. As it is we have no idea how each of the 3 trials contributing data to change in FEV1 pan out in terms of baseline severity, aminophylline level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Sentence in text with reference to additional table summarising data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. The way the 2nd to last paragraph of the data analyses is written, you seem to imply a meta-regression. It might be better to explain that you intend to examined the effect of each subgroup by the X2 analyses for heterogeneity and reference it. If you can't do the x2 analyses because of insufficient studies, you need to say it in the result section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Sentence inserted with reference. Comment added in results section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. If you can't do the sensitivity analyses because the trials were homogeneous or you had insufficient number of trials, you need to say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Comment included in text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e. Explain how you imputed missing data for outcomes such as length of stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Ream excluded. Other trials reported this as an outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Description of studies&lt;br&gt;a. Outcome: use of the word &amp;quot;focused&amp;quot; implies that this was the only outcome considered. If it's not true, change is to &amp;quot;reported&amp;quot; or other synonyms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Focused changed to reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused changed to reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Delete last sentence starting with &amp;quot;Ream 2001 did not&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;as you are repeating what you mentioned before in same para.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Sentence deleted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Results graph&lt;br&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;a. Select &amp;quot;no subtotals&amp;quot; for outcome with only 1 trial contribute data (e.g. outcome 01) or where trials are aggregated under only 1 subgroup.(e.g., 26) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;No subtotals selected for outcomes where only 1 trial reports data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;b. Use RD when dealing with trials with no events such as withdrawals and some adverse events such as seizures, arythmia and mention it in the data analyses section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Vomiting, headache, tremor seizures, arrhythmias, incidence of hypokalaemia, death, withdrawal due to adverse health events, withdrawal due to poor asthma control, and withdrawal any cause have been changed to RD. Data analysis section updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;c. Get rid of negatives in outcomes such as FEV1 and PEF where there was improvement not deterioration in values. Negatives should always mean &amp;quot;a reduction&amp;quot; such as in symptoms score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Negatives removed from outcomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;d. Verify absence/presence of negative sign for outcome 6, Yung , placebo group. Did the control group really exhibit a change in the opposite direction as the aminophylline group? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Yes at 6 hours the placebo group had a worse peak flow. The aminophylline group showed improvement in peak flow. This is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;e. Verify the magnitude of change in outcome 8, Strauss, placebo vs. aminophylline ; did the placebo group really did much better than amino?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Yes at 24 hours the placebo group had slightly higher peak flows than the aminophylline group. This is correct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;f. Verify SD of Bien in outcome 24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;g. Verify SD of Nuhoglu and Strass in outcome 25; they don't concord. Could 1 be SEM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Strauss reports mean and standard deviations in a table in the paper for this outcome. Nuhoglu uses Standard Deviations throughout his paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;h. Ensure that outcomes 26 and 27 are outcomes that occurred AFTER randomisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Outcome 26 did occur after randomisation in the Yung study&lt;br&gt;Outcome 27 did occur after randomisation in the Yung study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;i. If I understand well, Ream and Yung should not contribute any data for outcome 27 because these patients were intubated prior to randomisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;decision not to include Ream study following the advice of your comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the Yung study thre were 9 children who were excluded because they were intubated prior to randomisation. The 5 children included in outcome 27 were children who were intubated after randomisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;j. It seems the intensity of treatment prior to randomisation is unlikely to affect lengths of stay. I suspect baseline severity would. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;The baseline severity of the placebo and aminophylline groups in the Yung study were similar and not statistically different with regard to FEV1 Placebo ; Aminophylline = 38.5 (% predicted) : 35.3 (% predicted), oxygen saturations Aminophylline 88% Placebo 89.5% or Asthma score (8;8). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it would be better to stratify by % predicted FEV1 at baseline, by setting at randomisation (ED, Ward, or ICU)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;k. Outcome 28, what is the subgroup 3?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;There are no trials currently in this group. It is possible that a new trial might use a lower dose salbutamol combined with anticholinergi cs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;l. Outcome 35, how is hypertension a continuous variable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;My understanding is that blood pressure can be of any numerical value and therefore a continuous variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;m. Outcome 40 and 41, verify denominator for Yung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;Denominator verified placebo 82, aminophylline 81&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;n. Change labels of &amp;quot;placebo&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; if you decide to change the protocol in order to include Ream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decision not to include Ream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Results Text.&lt;br&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;a. In the 2nd paragraph, the numbers of the update don't seem to add up. It should be clear how many additional trials were considered, how many were excluded and why and how many new trials were added to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AM:&lt;br&gt;I have asked Toby to update this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: THIS IS UPDATED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FD:&lt;br&gt;b. When reporting # trials, actually report the # of trials really contributing data i.e., outcome 22, 2 trials contributing data, the third one has no SD. (same comment for outcomes 2, 3, 4, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;c. In lung function subsection, comment on the subgroup and sensitivity analyses you had planned. Report the X2 test for heterogeneity if you did subgroup analyses. If you couldn't do them, mention why: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; i. homogeneity of trials? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ii. Insufficient number of studies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. PICU admission: is this the right subtitle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e. Length of stay: what is the unit of the N? does this really apply re: occurred PRE-randomisation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f. Adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; i. Wouldn't it be better to report as RD to include trials with zero events? This would increase the number of contributing trials from 2 to 8 for withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: DONE AND TEXT UPDATED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216; I rephrased the 1st para to summarize the main findings&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216; I re-ordered the next paragraphs, starting with your well written section on the clinical importance of the group difference in % predicted FEV1 and then on secondary outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216; I think it is wise reflecting on a few issues such as, &lt;br&gt;a. to whom the studies apply (generalisability)-&amp;gt; 1 paragraph: &lt;br&gt; i. children, &lt;br&gt; ii. baseline severity in terms of baseline % pred FEV1, baseline admission rate to hospital in the control group, baseline ventilation rate, etc.&lt;br&gt; iii. non-response (determined how) and to what (b2-agonists, only 1 trial with inhaled anticholinergics). &lt;br&gt; iv. Considering the above, can we generalize the findings to patients treated according to the GINA or BTS guidelines who recommend a trio of b2-agonist, anticholinergics, systemic steroids. Isn't there a need to do future trials comparing aminophylline as add-on to triple therapy?&lt;br&gt;b. What are the alternatives-&amp;gt; 1 paragraph&lt;br&gt; i. IV magnesium sulfate&lt;br&gt; ii. Anticholinergics&lt;br&gt; iii. IV continuous B2-agonists, &lt;br&gt; iv. What type of studies who settle the issue&lt;br&gt;c. I would strengthen the paragraph on strengths and limitations of the data-&amp;gt; 1 paragraph: &lt;br&gt; i. small number of trials, small number of children, inconsistent co-treatment, &lt;br&gt; ii. strengths: confirmation of methodology and data, number of methodologically strong trials, &lt;br&gt; iii. highlight paucity of data in this field of high morbidity and need to placebo or alternatives (Mg So4, AC, IV B2 etc) controlled trials &lt;br&gt;d. safety. Do you have enough data to suggest that the absence of difference suggest safety or is due to inconsistent reporting?-&amp;gt; 1 paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL - I HAVE RE-WRITTEN PARTS OF THE DISCUSSION SECTION PLEASE SEE NOTE ABOVE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure the conclusion in the abstract and implications are concordant and supported by the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;francine&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.5&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;firstly I apologise for the delay in sending you the revised version of the review (see attached below). I have been incredibly busy since starting as a Consultant! - You have obviously worked hard on the review and I appreciate all your efforts. I have similar reservations to yourself about pooling the data but I think we have to let the editor of the review and Francine decide if this is an appropriate way to handle the data. I have remodelled the review based on the e-mail Francine sent you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new data it appears that aminophylline reduces hospital stay by about 5 hours in addition to improving FEV1 after 6 hours. I have pooled all the data into 1 comparison. I have also changed the text to fit the new changes in data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not had time to to look at the withdrawals due to adverse health events and poor asthma control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could look at the review and forward it to Francince for comments. I would then be happy to work on further changes depending on what Francine thinks and will update the withdrawals at that point as I am unlikely to get a chance to work on the review until Thursday at the earliest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yours Sincerely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Mitra &lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;FD: &lt;br&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to your question re: Ream, it seems that this study also tested the addition of aminophylline (versus placebo) to O2, inhaled bronchodilators, and systemic steroids in &amp;#8220;children unresponsive to repeated albuterol nebulisations&amp;#8221; so it can be pooled with other trials. The only difference is he use of iv terbutaline and the intensity of inhaled bronchodilators. I don&amp;#8217;t think that prevents any pooling &amp;#8211; but calls for sensitivity analyses with exclusion of this trial to see how much its findings impact on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes that could be pooled with other trials, if - Length of stay in hospital; - % requiring mechanical ventilation; - adverse health events; and withdrawal rates (which should be added); due to any cause withdrawal; due to adverse health events; withdrwals due to poor asthma control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;outcomes to be recorded but not pooled until similar outcome reported by future trials: &lt;br&gt;Length of stay in PICU &lt;br&gt;Time to discharge from PICU &amp;#8211; report in graph &amp;#8211; cannot be pooled yet but let&amp;#8217;s do it pending other trials. As the data is stratified on mechanical ventilation&amp;#8211; it may be worth to have two entries for this trial ; one for those on mechanical and those not on mechanical ventilation. This is not ideal as the randomization was not stratified on mechanical ventilation, only the data analyses. &amp;#8211; better yet; get pooled data from authors if possible. &amp;#216;Cumulative dose of albuterol in mcg/kg in PICU &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to see if we can convert the # of nebulisers required in 24 hrs (outcome 25) from previous studies in cumulative dose of albuterol in mcg/kg. I guess we would miss the sd. It would be nice to call for reporting this outcome for PICU future trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this is useful and not too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;TJL 130104&lt;br&gt;Dear Andy, Kirsty and Francine, &lt;br&gt; I have made several changes to the review partly in response to some of Francine's comments and partly to make the results more consistently. Some of the data were reported as WMDs when they were SMDs and I have now made sure that this reflects the findings in the meta-analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have revisited some of the trials in order to get more info on how the participants were rated at baseline in terms of severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the changes to the text in red - these should remain so until the review is approved by Chris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Short title (no longer in use): Aminophylline for children with acute asthma&lt;br&gt;To Francine 22 June 00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 10, 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;edition of review last edited on Dec 18, 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in red for your to approve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major comments:&lt;br&gt;1. the last search is already 1 yr old. It might be worth to update the literature search. If there has been no further trial, you are winning 1 year before the next update. If there are new trials to be included, you could add them in the awaiting assessment category., without including it in the review.&lt;br&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor issues:&lt;br&gt;change FEV1 for FEV(subscript 1)&lt;br&gt;add units for each outcome &lt;br&gt;replace &amp;quot;nebulizers&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;inhaled bronchodilators&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inhaled short-acting b2-agonists&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS:&lt;br&gt;update 7 for 8 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br&gt;abbreviated&lt;br&gt;results: the - sign is confusing and the outcomes should be reformulated so that improvement has a + sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS&lt;br&gt;slightly edited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES AND METHODOLOGY&lt;br&gt;reorganised&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;br&gt;reorganised, more concise.&lt;br&gt;please verify use of SMD vs WMD for symptoms&lt;br&gt;PLEASE add units for all outcomes examined with WMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;unclear how sensitivity analyses but not subgroup analyses could be done on intensity of treatment with bronchodilators.&lt;br&gt;remove summary estimates for all outcomes with only one study such as those pertaining only to Ream as this is not a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reorganised, please verify if you are comfortable &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;good luck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Intravenous aminophylline in children over 2 years receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Intravenous aminophylline in children over 2 years receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE (WITH ANDY MITRA POST FRANCINE AND TJL 130104)&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Intravenous aminophylline in children over 2 years receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE (WITH FD 050704)&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Intravenous aminophylline in children over 2 years receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE (WITH FD 280604)&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Intravenous aminophylline in children over two years of age receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Intravenous aminophylline in children over two years of age receiving inhaled bronchodilators for acute severe asthma UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 291104)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical Editing by CJC 8/5/2001&lt;br&gt;1. Contributions of authors to be added please (DONE)&lt;br&gt;2. What are the units of the WMD for FEV1 and PEF in the abstract results please.(DONE)&lt;br&gt;3. I am not convinced that the difference in RR of vomiting between the high and low dose subgroups would satisfy a test of between group difference. Likewise the trend to a difference in FEV1 between subgroups does not look significant. I think these differences are not significant and have been overplayed.&lt;br&gt;4. Characteristics of Included studies are particularly clear!&lt;br&gt;5. References have been tidied up (original title not required) (DONE)&lt;br&gt;6. I am afraid that we are no longer entering lung function as negatives in the data analysis as this leads to problems with reporting in the text. I have been through and removed the negative signs for FEV1 in the text as these appear to show lower FEV1 with aminophylline, but would ask you to change the data in the data tables to remove the minus signs for FEV1 and peak flow. It is better to show the direction of effect by labelling the axes on the graph to show better with treatment or higher with treatment. This can be done by editing the outcomes (using the graph tab). Sorry this will involve some work...... Along the same lines I have changed the PEF and symptom scores at 24 hours to default to random effects so that the metaview result matches the text. (DONE)&lt;br&gt;7. Metaview tables indicate that PEF is % predicted but the text says litres/min, which is correct please? (DONE)&lt;br&gt;8. I have run spell check and corrected accordingly - are you going for american nebulizers or english nebulisers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great review Andy! Could you deal with the above and then recycle to Steve please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21/5/2001&lt;br&gt;THanks for sorting out the Metaview data and graph labelling. I will pass this on to Paul today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul,&lt;br&gt;This is all checked; higher aminophylline levels probably do cause more vomiting but I am not convinced that this data shows significant difference between subgroups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE CAN WE ALL USE THIS VERSION AS THE TEXT HAS BEEN CORRECTED FOR SPELLING ETC.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-03-30 14:03:07 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Paolo Rosati" REVIEW_NO="IAM-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

Due to lack of placebo, these studies were excluded, despite their otherwise relevance to current research in this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conclusions thus remain unchanged from the initial review.

<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:22:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">Intravenous aminophylline for acute severe asthma in children over two years receiving inhaled bronchodilators</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Acute asthma is a common paediatric emergency prevalent in many countries. Treatment aims to reverse asthma by opening up the airways and targeting the underlying inflammation of the airways. Beta-agonists, anticholinergic agents and glucocorticoids are currently the most commonly used strategies. In the past, aminophylline has been extensively used for the management of acute asthma, despite side effects. However, its use has declined with the availability of effective inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids. The purpose of this review was to assess whether the use of intravenous aminophylline in children receiving maximised inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids produced additional beneficial effects. We identified a small number of good quality trials which compared aminophylline with placebo in children given inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoid therapy. This review found evidence that children treated with aminophylline had a greater improvement in lung function than children treated with placebo, when both groups received inhaled bronchodilators and steroids and they responded incompletely to these initial therapies. However, aminophylline use also resulted in greater risk of vomiting. Aminophylline use in children may be appropriate if children have a role in severe acute exacerbations of asthma where response to maximised therapy (inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids) is poor. These results are based on small numbers and further work in this area is required.</P>

<P>Seven trials met the inclusion criteria (380 participants). Methodological quality was high. All studies recruited children with acute severe asthma and requiring hospital admission. Six studies sought participants who were unresponsive to nebulised short-acting beta-agonist and administered systemic steroids to study participants. In two studies where some children were able to perform spirometry, baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was between 35 and 45% predicted. The addition of aminophylline to steroids and ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist significantly improved FEV<SUB>1</SUB>% predicted over placebo at 6-8 hours, 12-18 hours and 24 hours. Aminophylline led to a greater improvement in PEF% predicted over placebo at 12-18 hours. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, symptoms, frequency of nebulisations and mechanical ventilation rates. There were insufficient data to permit aggregation for oxygenation and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. Aminophylline led to a three-fold increase in the risk of vomiting. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with regard to hypokalaemia, headaches, tremor, seizures, arrhythmias and deaths. <B>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In children with a severe asthma exacerbation, the addition of intravenous aminophylline to ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and glucocorticoids (with or without anticholinergics) improves lung function within 6 hours of treatment. However there is no apparent reduction in symptoms, number of nebulised treatment and length of hospital stay. There is insufficient evidence to assess the impact on oxygenation, PICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Aminophylline is associated with a significant increased risk of vomiting.<B>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:47:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Intravenous aminophylline produced effective bronchodilation in children with acute severe asthma and was the drug of choice for many years (<LINK REF="REF-May-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1974</LINK>). The therapeutic effects of aminophylline in asthma include bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1978</LINK>) and improved diaphragmatic contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Wanke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanke 1994</LINK>). It also has inotropic and chronotropic effects on myocardium (<LINK REF="REF-Conrad-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conrad 1981</LINK>) and improves mental alertness. Therapeutic effects occur at blood levels of 10 -20 mg/dl and perhaps at levels of below 10 mg/dl. Levels above this narrow therapeutic range may occur and cause toxic effects. These include diuresis, hypokalaemia, insomnia, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmias, convulsions and sudden death (<LINK REF="REF-Emerman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerman 1990</LINK>). In many centres it has become supplanted by the use of beta-2 agonists for the treatment of acute severe asthma.<BR/> <BR/>More recently there has been renewed interest in intravenous aminophylline. Current guidelines assert that there may be a role for aminophylline in particularly severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). This review addresses the following question : "Do children with severe asthma who have a sub-optimal response to maximised treatment with oxygen, inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids receive additional benefit following aminophylline?"</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>We wish to determine if the addition of intravenous aminophylline produces a beneficial effect in children with acute severe asthma who are already receiving oxygen, maximised inhaled bronchodilators and oral/intravenous glucocorticoids. Benefits of interest include lung function, symptoms, oxygenation, needs for inhaled bronchodilators, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalisation, and side effects.<BR/> <BR/>In addition, we wished to examine whether any beneficial effect of aminophylline may be influenced by the intensity of concomitant therapy, i.e., amount of inhaled bronchodilators and/or late administration of glucocorticoids.</P>

<P>The overall risk of bias was low, with a number of studies employing adequate procedures to minimise the risk of bias in allocating participants to treatment groups, and masking treatment group assignment. All the studies had adequate concealment of allocation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly reported in trials, as were withdrawals and dropouts. Statistical methods used for analysis were explained in the studies. Confirmation of methodology and study design was obtained for three of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhoglu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhoglu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data were stratified on the basis of ß2-agonist treatment (submaximal inhaled ß2 (&lt;.45 mg/kg/hr); maximized inhaled ß2 (&gt;=0.45 mg/kg/hr); maximised ß2 (&gt;=0.45mg/kg/hr) + anticholinergics). This is because other subgroup analyses to examine the impact of baseline severity, intensity of bronchodilator therapy prior to randomisation and aminophylline serum levels on study results could not be done because of the small number of trials reporting these values. In addition, the impact on the timing and intensity of treatment with glucocorticoids on study results could not be examined because all trials used adequate early doses of parenteral glucocorticoids.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:31:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In children with sub-optimal response to one hour of treatment with maximised beta-agonists and systemic glucocorticoids, with or without inhaled anticholinergics, the addition of aminophylline improved lung function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) within six hours of treatment, and the favourable effect persisted for 24 hours. Subgroup analyses were inadequately powered to detect the impact of baseline severity, serum aminophylline levels and intensity of co-treatment on the magnitude of effect. The early improvement in lung function did coincide with an improvement in symptoms at 6-8 hours, but the sustained effect on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was not matched by that of PEF or symptoms at 24 hours. There was no significant difference in the number of nebulised treatment in the initial 24 hours, admission rate to ICU or the length of hospital stay. There were no or insufficient data to examine any effect of treatment on oxygenation and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Other than a three-fold increase in the risk of vomiting, the addition of aminophylline was not associated with apparent increase in other side effects or in withdrawals. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>In children with very severe asthma exacerbations, not responding to maximised inhaled therapy and glucocorticoids, admission to intensive care and possibly intubation may be required. In these children, even a small improvement in lung function might be important clinically; thus, the observed increased in lung function associated with theophylline use may translate in a clinical benefit that could not be captured by aggregated outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK> recommend that IV aminophylline at a loading dose of 5mg/kg over 20 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 1mg/kg, should be <I>considered</I> in a high dependency setting where children over two years of age are unresponsive to ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and steroid therapy. The trial from which this recommendation is mainly derived did detect significant differences in terms of lung function, and there was a slightly lower ICU admission rate favouring the aminophylline group (<LINK REF="STD-Yung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 1998</LINK>). The findings of this study are noteworthy, not least due to the intensive ß2-agonist regime initiated by the trialists. Failure to respond to a ß2-agonist was an inclusion criterion in this study, and as such the positive effect of aminophylline would have been more easily detected as the sample was carefully selected. In contrast <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1994</LINK> did not detect significant differences on any clinical outcome. In this study particularly severe children were not included and initial response to a bronchodilator was not assessed. The lower threshold for clinical scores as an exclusion criterion may have rendered the sample less severe, and therefore less likely to benefit from the addition of aminophylline.<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>Whilst improvements in lung function did not always correlate with improvements in symptoms, some clinical assessment undertaken did incorporate lung function assessment. <LINK REF="STD-Yung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 1998</LINK> reported significant changes in both clinical assessment scores and lung function; the remaining studies which reported both outcomes did not report improvements in either. The absence of a significant effect on symptom scores after 6-8 hours may be related to the small number of trials with low numbers of their participants reporting these outcomes. The censored nature of spirometric outcomes in paediatric trials (where only a subset of participants are able to provide data on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or PEF) may prevent a clearer picture emerging from the data. In future studies, stratification of data between those able and those unable to perform spirometry would facilitate better scrutiny of the relationship (if any) between lung function and symptoms in the acute setting. One further explanation for this could be that the association between changes in clinical scores remain largely unvalidated against changes in lung function. There may be different sensitivities in the symptom scores used, and between-observer reproducibility may also vary (<LINK REF="REF-Chalut-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalut 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from only two trials did not identify a difference in the number of nebulised bronchodilators which children required in the first 24 hours after admission and length of hospital admission. Insufficient data prevented aggregation of data for more clinically important outcomes such as risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>In one small study which did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Ream-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2001</LINK>), aminophylline did lead to faster clinical improvement. Whilst not in itself a reason to recommend routine use of aminophylline, the study does justify further work in this subgroup of patients, and in particular those who have been mechanically ventilated.</P>
<P>Several adverse events classically associated with this therapy that did not occur with greater frequency in the actively treated group (such as headache, tremor and seizures). However, use of aminophylline was associated with a 3.7 fold increased in the risk of vomiting. While aminophylline appears otherwise safe, the discomfort associated with increased vomiting should be acknowledged. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Firm conclusions regarding any differences in the response to aminophylline between children who have failed to respond to ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and those who improve after administration of these drugs could not be drawn. The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 1998</LINK>) which showed a positive effect of aminophylline clearly influenced the results of this meta-analysis, and was conducted in a quite carefully selected sample of children. Whilst this study was not the only one to maximise the dose of ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, it was the largest one and therefore had the greatest statistical power of the assembled studies to detect differences. Further trials would help to clarify the validity of the findings of this review and could help to determine more clearly the role of aminophylline in acute severe asthma in comparison with other therapies currently recommended in this setting, including IV MgSO<SUB>4</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:31:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children with a severe asthma acute exacerbation, unresponsive to maximised bronchodilation, supplemental oxygen and systemic steroids, the addition of aminophylline improves lung function within six to eight hours of treatment with an improvement in symptoms up to eight hours after therapy. The addition of aminophylline was not associated with a significant reduction in the number of nebulised bronchodilator treatments and length of hospital stay. There is insufficient evidence to confirm whether these benefits translate in more important outcomes such as improved oxygenation, and reduction in the rate and length of intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:31:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Due to the promising findings in several small trials, larger paediatric studies involving children aged 1 to 17 years with severe acute asthma are needed. Randomised controlled trials should compare aminophylline with placebo as add-on therapy to maximised inhaled/nebulized ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and anticholinergics with early intravenous glucocorticoids. The trials should be sufficiently powered to examine the rate of intubation and mechanical ventilation in children with acute severe asthma, and therefore be preferably multicentre trials.</P>
<P>We urge trialists to measure and report changes in lung function, symptoms (using validated and responsive symptom scores), saturation, oxygen requirement, intensive care admission rates, intubation rates and side effects at various points in time (e.g., 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours).</P>
<P>Studies comparing aminophylline with other alternative treatments such as MgSO<SUB>4</SUB> and IV ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists would be useful in establishing the relative efficacies of these treatments.</P>

<P>This trial compares subcutaneous adrenaline as a bronchodilator, instead of inhaled beta 2 agonists. Furthermore the aminophylline dosage was sub-optimal<BR/>Firstly, as the study by Zvi Ben-Zvi et al: An Evaluation of the Initial Treatment of Acute Asthma. Paediatrics Vol 70, no 3 September 1982, pages 348 - 353 shows, the subcutaneous adrenaline is a much less effective bronchodilator than nebulised agents in children. Thus it might be expected that aminophylline makes a difference in this study but might not in clinical practice with the bronchodilators in common use today. Thus this study does not fit the inclusion criteria of the meta analysis which is looking at whether aminophylline has benefit following maximal inhaled bronchodilators.</P>
<P>Secondly, at 24 hours, 11 patients in the aminophylline group had serum levels below 7.5mcg/ml and 8 of these 11 had levels below 5mcg/ml. With such low levels it makes it difficult to ascribe their clinical improvement to the theophylline they received.</P>

<P>A total of 375 abstracts were identified from searching the Airways Group register of trials. Of these citations, 11 papers were obtained for full text assesment. The details of the excluded studies and their reasons for their exclusion are reported in full elsewhere (see table 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies'). Studies did not meet entry criteria due to lack of randomisation (N = one), and inappropriate control groups (N = three). Seven trials were originally included in the review. A kappa value of 0.64 was calculated for agreement between the two reviewers (Standard Error 0.12) in the selection of included trials. The two trials which reported FEV1 used the most intensive beta agonist regime (see Table 01 for the characteristics of Included Studies by subgroups).</P>

<P>An update search conducted in December 2004 identified 71 references. We obtained four of these for further scrutiny (Baba 2002; Evans 1979; Ream 2001; Roberts 2003). None of the studies met the inclusion criteria due to absence of a placebo group (N = 3), and the recruitment of adult participants (N = 1). Please see 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' for further details. <BR/>

<TD>
<P>For the update of this review four references were retrieved from a total of 28 references. One of these is an ongoing study of aminophylline in PICU-treated children with status asthmaticus. Two studies were excluded on the grounds that one was a study of theophylline in chronic asthma (Wang 2004), and one was not randomised (Kato 2004). One study is awaiting assessment because of restricted availability of the journal (Whig 2001).</P>
