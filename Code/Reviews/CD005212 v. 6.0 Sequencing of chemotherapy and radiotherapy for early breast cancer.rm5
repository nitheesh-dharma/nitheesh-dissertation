<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-21 03:45:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy reduce the risk of breast cancer recurring and the risk of dying from breast cancer. Generally, these therapies are given after surgery but there is uncertainty about whether they should be given at the same time (concurrently) or one after the other (sequentially). If they are used sequentially, the radiotherapy or the chemotherapy could be used first and concerns have been expressed that the effectiveness of the therapy that is delayed might be reduced. However, it has also been suggested that using chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time may be more toxic than keeping them separate. This review examined the current evidence on the best way to administer chemotherapy and radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. We were able to include three randomised trials. Two of these, with 853 women, assessed radiotherapy and chemotherapy given at the same time versus chemotherapy given first followed by radiotherapy. The third trial randomised 244 women to radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The evidence produced by these three well-conducted trials suggests that recurrence of a woman's cancer and her chances of dying from breast cancer are similar regardless of the order of the treatments, provided that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are commenced within seven months of the surgery. The trials provided limited information regarding adverse events, side effects or quality of life associated with the different sequences of treatment. The limited evidence available does suggest that the frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are similar regardless of which sequence is used. However, it should be noted that the women in these trials were treated, on average, in the early 2000s. As a result, the trials do not assess the modern types of radiotherapy, and new types of chemotherapy (such as taxanes) or other drugs (such as Herceptin). We will add relevant trials that include these more recent treatments to future updates of this review.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:17:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>After surgery for localised breast cancer, radiotherapy (RT) improves both local control and breast cancer-specific survival. In patients at risk of harbouring micro-metastatic disease, adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) improves 15-year survival. However, the best sequence of administering these two types of adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer is unclear.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:17:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>To determine the effects of different sequencing of adjuvant CT and RT for women with early breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:18:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An updated search was carried out in the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (20 May 2011), MEDLINE (14 December 2011), EMBASE (20 May 2011) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (20 May 2011). Details of the search strategy and methods of coding for the Specialised Register are described in the Group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. We extracted studies that had been coded as 'early', 'chemotherapy' and 'radiotherapy'.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:19:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials evaluating different sequencing of CT and RT.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-05-08 12:46:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the eligibility and quality of the identified studies and extracted data from the published reports of the included trials. We derived odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) from the available numerical data. Toxicity data were extracted, where reported. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and conducted analyses on the basis of the method of sequencing of the two treatments.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-21 03:44:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials reporting two different sequencing comparisons were identified. There were no significant differences between the various methods of sequencing adjuvant therapy for local recurrence-free survival, overall survival, relapse-free survival and metastasis-free survival based on 1166 randomised women in three trials. Concurrent chemoradiation increased anaemia (OR 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 2.15), telangiectasia (OR 3.85; 95% CI 1.37 to 10.87) and pigmentation (OR 15.96; 95% CI 2.06 to 123.68). Treated women did not report worse cosmesis with concurrent chemoradiation but physician-reported assessments did (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.42 to 3.07). Other measures of toxicity did not differ between the two types of sequencing. On the basis of one trial (244 women), RT before CT was associated with an increased risk of neutropenic sepsis (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.26 to 6.98) compared with CT before RT, but other measures of toxicity did not differ.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-21 04:06:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data included in this review, from three well-conducted randomised trials, suggest that different methods of sequencing CT and RT do not appear to have a major effect on recurrence or survival for women with breast cancer if RT is commenced within seven months after surgery.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:30:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>For women with localised breast cancer who undergo conservative surgery or mastectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) reduces the risk of local recurrence and improves breast cancer-specific survival (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ragaz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragaz 2005</LINK>). Adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) has also been shown to improve 15-year survival (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 23:31:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Current practices for the sequencing of RT and CT include administering CT before RT, administering CT and RT concurrently, or 'sandwiching' RT in the middle of the CT course. It is not clear which of these different sequences is the most effective for women with early-stage breast cancer. It has been suggested that the sequence of these two treatments may affect patient outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Recht-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Recht 1996</LINK>). For example, a delay in initiating RT was found to increase the risk of local recurrence (odds ratio (OR) 2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 3.57) (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2003</LINK>). However, a delay in commencing CT may also have a detrimental effect on survival.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-21 03:22:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>One published randomised trial initially found a non-significant improvement in overall survival if CT was given first (<LINK REF="REF-Recht-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Recht 1996</LINK>) but longer follow-up did not reveal any difference in the rates of local or distant recurrence or death between the two treatment groups (<LINK REF="REF-Bellon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellon 2001</LINK>). Additionally, some non-randomised studies have suggested that delaying RT while CT is administered first could increase local recurrence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Buchholz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchholz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buchholz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchholz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartsell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartsell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leonard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Recht-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Recht 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slotman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slotman 1994</LINK>). Conversely, a delay in the administration of systemic CT while RT is delivered could allow the proliferation of micro-metastatic disease to an extent that it can no longer be dealt with adequately by the CT.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-21 03:26:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>In many parts of the world there are waiting lists for RT (<LINK REF="REF-Ash-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ash 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenny-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacKillop-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKillop 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacKillop-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKillop 1995</LINK>). The delivery of CT first allows patients to start treatment and overcomes the problem of RT waiting lists (<LINK REF="REF-Kenny-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>If a systematic review helps to resolve this uncertainty about the relative effects of different sequences of CT and RT, it will assist in making these choices. For example, if it shows that sequencing of the two treatments makes little or no difference for cancer-related outcomes such as survival and local recurrence, then choosing to give CT first may be preferable for both logistic reasons and patient preference.</P>

<P>Two review authors (BH and ML) judged and graded each RCT by using the Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Grades given by each author were compared and disagreements were resolved by discussion. The tool contains six domains and each domain was assigned a judgement related to the risk of bias. A judgement of 'low' indicated a low risk of bias, 'high' indicated a high risk of bias and 'unclear' indicated an unknown risk of bias. The six domains were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>other sources of bias.</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-11-21 02:28:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We used the intention-to-treat principle in analysing data from the trials and determined a weighted average treatment effect by using the fixed-effect model to combine results (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>) in Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the comparisons of concurrent versus sequential CT and RT, raw data were not reported and therefore the HR and associated statistics were calculated, where necessary, using an Excel spreadsheet developed by the Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London (<LINK REF="REF-Sydes" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydes</LINK>). This spreadsheet was used for the end points of overall survival and relapse-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, for the comparison of RT then CT versus CT then RT, raw data were not reported and therefore the HR and associated statistics were calculated, where necessary, using an Excel spreadsheet developed by the Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London (<LINK REF="REF-Sydes" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydes</LINK>). In this case, the spreadsheet was used for the end points of overall survival, distant metastases and relapse-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute toxicity was dichotomised and we reported the OR with 95% CI. The authors used a four-point scale to report cosmesis (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and reported the proportion of women with excellent cosmetic results (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For late toxicity (breast atrophy, breast fibrosis, telangiectasia, lymphoedema and cosmesis), the data were dichotomised and we reported the Grade III/IV toxicity on the LENT-SOMA scale (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). For pigmentation (not included in LENT-SOMA) we reported those who had poor or very poor pigmentation (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Late cosmetic toxicity was dichotomised and we reported the proportion who had poor or very poor cosmesis on a five-point scale (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>If quality of life scores are available for future updates, we will obtain the standard deviation and the mean to analyse the data. If different scales are reported in the trials, we will use the standardised mean difference to summarise data (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>After screening the titles and abstracts retrieved electronically and by handsearching, we identified 441 reports for possible inclusion in this review. Further screening of these reduced the number to 45 reports and, where possible, we obtained the full articles for these.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants, follow-up and treatment regimens</HEADING>
<P>The three RCTs, included in the updated version of this review, randomised 1166 patients. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>), with 922 patients, compared concurrent CT and RT with sequential administration of CT before RT. <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK> initially reported results at 65 months' follow-up then again after median follow-up of 111 months. <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK> reported at 60 months' median follow-up, but late effects were reported at a median of 6.7 years' follow-up. First-generation chemotherapeutic agents were used (i.e. no anthracyclines or taxanes).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>, which compared RT followed by CT to CT followed by RT, RT started by 84 days (about 2.8 months) after surgery.</P>
<P>The third RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>) compared RT followed by CT to CT followed by RT in 244 patients. <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK> reported at a median follow-up of 135 months. More information on the three included studies can be found in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Anthracyclines were used but not taxanes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Local recurrence</HEADING>
<P>For the comparison of concurrent versus sequential CT and RT, local recurrence was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>, but loco-regional recurrence was reported in <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>, so we were not able to combine the results for this outcome. For the comparison of RT then CT versus CT then RT, local recurrence was reported as first-event data and we have contacted the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>) in order to clarify this but await their reply.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Acute toxicity was assessed at one month after completion of RT (<LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>) and was reported for 30% (214/716) of women randomised. Grade III/IV acute toxicity was reported (however, the scoring system was not given; <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>). Acute haematological and skin toxicity was reported using the common toxicity criteria (CTC) acute scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Late toxicity was assessed in <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK> and scored prospectively at a median follow-up of 6.7 years in 29% (214/716) of those women randomised. Two hundred and ninety-seven women from the five larger participating institutions were asked to report for a follow-up examination and 72% (214/297) of these women were evaluated for late toxicity. Late toxicity was scored using the Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force (LENT)/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (SOMA) scale (validated scale) by an observer blinded to the treatment arm (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). A personal five-point scoring system was used to score pigmentation (not included in the LENT/SOMA scale; see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Late toxicity was scored as a single event at last follow-up. Breast oedema was defined as "permanent swelling with an increased volume of the breast" and fibrosis was detected by palpation, in comparison to the untreated breast. Oedema was reported when the measurements differed. Cardiac events were defined as myocardial infarction or clinical evidence of congestive cardiac failure. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was characterised by a cough, fever and shortness of breath that occurred two to nine months after completing RT.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>, cardiac toxicity was assessed in 231/244 (95%) women at a median follow-up of 53 months. Cardiac events were defined as myocardial infarction or congestive cardiac failure. Late toxicity data were extracted from medical records and not prospectively collected. Cellulitis was defined as the "inflammation of the breast unresponsive to antibiotics" and lymphoedema was recorded if there was a description of a "swollen or oedematous arm in the treatment record" (no measurements were made at baseline or of the contralateral arm). Brachial plexopathy was evaluated only in those women who had regional nodal RT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cosmesis</HEADING>
<P>For the comparison of concurrent versus sequential CT and RT, cosmetic outcome was reported for 29% (214/716) of women after a median of 6.7 years' follow-up. Seventy-two per cent (214/297) of women from the five larger participating institutions who were asked to report for a follow-up examination were evaluated for cosmesis. The primary reason for refusal was a reluctance to attend the hospital for clinical assessments. In <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>, cosmesis was evaluated both by the patient (using a five-point scale; <LINK REF="REF-Hoeller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoeller 2003</LINK>) and physician blinded to treatment allocation. Physician-assessed cosmesis was scored thus by an overall cosmetic satisfaction score based on the comparison between the treated and untreated breast (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) using "Harris's classification modified by Beadle" (<LINK REF="REF-Beadle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beadle 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1979</LINK>; see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The second score was derived using a detailed definition of how to score cosmesis satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlauer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlauer 2003</LINK>). To lessen inter-observer variability, two observers examined 40 patients and the ratings were reproducible. There was "fair correlation" reported between the patient's and physician's assessment of cosmesis. The two methods of scoring cosmetic outcome by physicians were reported to be concordant (<LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the comparison of RT then CT versus CT then RT, cosmetic outcome was assessed in women without recurrence by a single radiation oncologist at 18 to 30 months after treatment (31% (76/244) of those women randomised; <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>). The authors reported those in each group who had "excellent" cosmetic results (i.e. a virtual absence of changes due to treatment) on a four-point scale (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1979</LINK>). Figures were derived from the percentages given in the text (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>, blinding was not reported for the assessors of objective outcomes, if investigations such as mammograms or bone scans were performed at different times in the two groups, it may have introduced lead time bias. In <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>, for the subjective outcome of cosmesis, the assessor was blinded, which minimises the risk of bias for this outcome. Detection bias was less likely because there were pre-specified intervals for clinical examination and investigations. Assessment of both late toxicity and cosmetic outcome were blinded, which minimises the risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-20 14:42:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For women who elect to have breast-conservation surgery for early breast cancer, achieving and maintaining local control and improving survival are of paramount importance. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview has shown the benefits of CT and RT as adjuvant treatments (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005b</LINK>) and this review set out to explore whether there is an optimal sequencing of adjuvant CT and RT as part of the conservative management of women with early breast cancer.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-14 20:54:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We have been able to include data from three RCTs of two different comparisons of sequencing. The comparisons are concurrent versus sequential treatment (with CT before RT using first-generation chemotherapeutic agents, i.e. no anthracyclines or taxanes) and RT followed by CT versus CT followed by RT (using anthracyclines but no taxanes). In both comparisons the evidence suggests that there are no major differences between the sequencing techniques in regards to mortality and local or distant recurrence. There is some evidence for differences in toxicity between sequencing techniques but most of the harms reported in the trials were not significantly different between the randomised groups and CIs were wide (see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). We found that there was disparity between the patient and physician assessment of cosmesis with physicians reporting worse cosmetic outcomes than the women themselves (<LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>; see <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). Others have also reported this difference in the perception of cosmetic outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2008</LINK>). No data were available for costs, quality of life or consumer preference. However, caution in interpreting these results is advised as, given the low event rate for some end points such as local recurrence, the statistical power for detecting a clinically important risk difference in such outcomes is very small.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-03-20 14:42:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The findings of this review provide reassurance that the general practice of giving CT before RT is not detrimental in terms of overall survival and toxicity in comparison with either the opposite sequence or the concurrent administration of CT and RT. However, some caveats are important in applying these results to current practice. First, the treatments in the included trials were given in the early 2000s on average and the CT regimens may not be considered optimal today. In this case, first-generation chemotherapeutic agents were used (i.e. no anthracyclines or taxanes) in <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK> trials while anthracyclines were used in the <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK> trial. Second, the surgical outcomes in the trials might be considered unacceptable today. Positive surgical margins are an independent predictor of local recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Leong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leong 2004</LINK>) but women who had positive surgical margins were eligible for the study of RT followed by CT versus CT followed by RT (<LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>). The standard of practice today would be to try to ensure negative surgical margins were achieved before RT. Finally, although the length of follow-up in the included trials is adequate to detect differences in local recurrences, it is not yet long enough to assess the effects on breast cancer mortality even with 10-year data for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>). Local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy reaches a peak at about two years (<LINK REF="REF-Churn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churn 2001</LINK>) and continues at one per cent per year for at least the next two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1995</LINK>). Distant recurrences and deaths from breast cancer take longer (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2011</LINK>) and would not have been captured with the relatively short follow-up of these trials. The length of follow-up is also short for evaluation of some late toxicity namely, cardiac and second malignancy.</P>
<P>It has not been possible to answer some questions with this initial version of the review. These include:</P>
<P>1. Harms, costs, patient preferences and impact on the QoL</P>
<P>The treatment-related toxicity differed little between the sequencing techniques. The women treated did not report worse cosmetic outcome with concurrent CT/RT, but the physician-reported outcomes for cosmesis were worse with concurrent CT/RT (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). There was no information regarding the QoL, women's preferences or costs in the included trials. It has been shown that concurrent CT/RT can decrease a woman's QoL but this seems similar to that found with sequential therapy, and there may be an advantage for concurrent therapy arising from its shorter duration (<LINK REF="REF-Macquart_x002d_Moulin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macquart-Moulin 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. The impact of new CT regimens and biological agents</P>
<P>The original standard CT regimen of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) has been superseded by anthracycline-based regimens, particularly in high-risk younger women (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005b</LINK>). In theory, these regimens should be less toxic than the older regimens if delivered over the same or shorter time period. Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are new CT agents that reduce the risk of death when used in the adjuvant setting for women with early breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2005</LINK>). There is currently no information regarding the optimum sequencing of RT with taxanes. If taxanes were used sequentially with standard CT agents (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2003</LINK>), this would lead to an extended delay in starting RT, which has the potential to increase the local recurrence rate. Reassuringly, in one trial in which RT was delayed by the delivery of paclitaxel, there was a reduction in local recurrence for those women who had undergone breast-conserving therapy and received paclitaxel (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, new agents are continually being developed for treating women with breast cancer (e.g. trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and lapatinib), but the evidence to guide decisions about how these should be sequenced with RT is limited. The delay to start of RT in the included studies was less than seven months (see discussion of Included Studies), more modern chemotherapeutic regimens including taxanes can be delivered within this time frame, assuming no delays in CT delivery.</P>
<P>3. The impact of new modes of RT</P>
<P>New techniques for breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery are emerging, such as partial breast irradiation using a variety of methods. These techniques generally seek to reduce the amount of normal tissue radiated in order to reduce the incidence of acute and late side effects. However, there is also one completed trial (MA20) examining the role of nodal irradiation after conservative surgery. Early release of data suggest improved disease-free survival with the addition of nodal radiation. The potential impact of this on clinical practice would be to increase the volume of tissue radiated (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2011</LINK>). Changes to the fractionation used for RT after conservative surgery should also lead to less time being needed for RT (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2002</LINK>). If these techniques are effective, this may allow RT to be delivered quickly and easily, before prolonged courses of CT. There is currently no reliable information regarding the best sequencing of CT with these RT techniques.</P>
<P>4. Concurrent administration of modern CT and RT</P>
<P>The concurrent use of CT and RT minimises any delay in starting RT and the concurrent use of CMF and RT does not appear to affect objectively measured acute or late cosmetic outcomes or complications (<LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Faul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 1999</LINK>). There is some non-randomised evidence that the concurrent use of more modern anthracycline CT and RT is associated with more high-grade skin toxicity and higher hospitalisation rates, which have been deemed by some to be unacceptable (<LINK REF="STD-Fiets-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiets 2003</LINK>). We identified one ongoing study, which has completed accrual and has reported in abstract form, which will provide information about the feasibility and effectiveness of concurrent RT and anthracyclines (<LINK REF="STD-SECRAB" TYPE="STUDY">SECRAB</LINK>). Finally, some researchers maintain that the concurrent use of RT and paclitaxel is feasible and have reported its use without dose reductions, pneumonitis or brachial plexopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Formenti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Formenti 2003</LINK>). However, others have reported pneumonitis rates as high as 14% and have concluded that caution is required (<LINK REF="REF-Taghian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taghian 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>We studied 1166 women randomised in three studies with follow-up to 10 years. There is high-quality objective evidence related to the toxicity and cosmetic outcomes when concurrent RT is compared to sequential RT for early breast cancer. There is high-quality evidence that local control and overall survival are similar for concurrent CT and RT, RT followed by CT and CT followed by RT for women with early breast cancer.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-21 00:56:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>All three studies were at low risk of selection bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK>, lack of blinding for objective outcomes may have introduced lead-time bias. In <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK>, blinding reduced the risk of bias for the subjective outcomes of cosmesis and toxicity. Blinding was not mentioned in <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK>, which makes the evaluation of objective outcomes (cosmesis and toxicity) at risk of bias. While <LINK REF="STD-Arcangeli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arcangeli 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ARCOSEIN" TYPE="STUDY">ARCOSEIN</LINK> were at low risk of bias for attrition, <LINK REF="STD-Bellon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bellon 2005</LINK> was at high risk of bias. As we were not able to review protocols, the risk of selective reporting bias for all three studies was unclear (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
