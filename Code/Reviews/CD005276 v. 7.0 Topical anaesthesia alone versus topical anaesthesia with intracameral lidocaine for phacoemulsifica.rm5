<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Topical anaesthesia using eye drops alone compared with a combination of eyedrops and anaesthesia within the eye for cataract surgery</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There are many different options for anaesthesia during cataract surgery. Using anaesthetic eye drops (topical anaesthesia) has become an increasingly popular option in modern, rapid-turnover day case cataract surgery as it is minimally invasive, cost effective, less prone to complications and provides for faster patient rehabilitation. Many surgeons who use topical anaesthesia supplement this with anaesthetic administered within the eye (intracameral) during the surgery. This review has found that the use of intracameral lidocaine as a supplement to topical anaesthesia significantly reduces intraoperative pain perception when compared to the use of topical anaesthesia alone. No significant difference was demonstrated between the groups receiving topical anaesthesia alone and topical eye drops combined with intracameral anaesthesia in terms of the need for supplemental anaesthesia, intraoperative adverse events or corneal toxicity. We conclude that the administration of intracameral anaesthetic during surgery is an effective and safe supplementation to topical anaesthesia.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cataract is defined as loss of transparency of the natural lens and is usually an age-related phenomenon. The only recognized treatment available for cataract involves surgery. An ideal anaesthetic should allow for pain-free surgery with no systemic or local complications. It should be cost effective and should facilitate a stress-free procedure for surgeon and patient alike. Topical anaesthesia involves applying anaesthetic eye drops to the surface of the eye prior to and during surgery. This has found large acceptance especially in the USA where it is used by 61% of cataract surgeons. Many surgeons who perform cataract surgery under topical anaesthesia also use intraoperative supplementary intracameral lidocaine (injected directly into the anterior chamber of the eye). The benefits and possible risks of intracameral lidocaine have been assessed by a number of randomized controlled trials, but the results have been conflicting and many of the endpoints have been heterogeneous.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess pain during surgery and patient satisfaction with topical anaesthesia alone compared to topical anaesthesia with intracameral anaesthesia for phacoemulsification. The secondary objectives were to assess adverse effects and complications attributable to choice of anaesthesia and the need for additional anaesthesia during surgery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>
<I> </I>
<I> </I>2006,<I> </I>Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006) and LILACs (1982 to 3 May 2006). We also searched the reference lists of the identified studies and the Science Citation Index. We did not have any language restriction.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical anaesthesia alone to topical anaesthesia with intracameral lidocaine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes data were presented as odds ratios. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was employed. A random-effects model was used unless there were fewer than three trials in a comparison, where a fixed-effect model was used. We explored heterogeneity between trial results using a chi-squared test.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of eight trials comprising of 1281 patients were identified for analysis. Our data comparison showed a significantly lower intraoperative pain perception in patient groups using supplementary intracameral lidocaine, although the difference was small. No significant difference was demonstrated between the groups receiving topical anaesthesia alone and topical combined with intracameral anaesthesia in terms of the need for supplemental anaesthesia, intraoperative adverse events or corneal toxicity. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The use of intracameral unpreserved 1% lidocaine is an effective and safe adjunct to topical anaesthesia for phacoemulsification cataract surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-01 13:59:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">
<P>Cataract is defined as loss of transparency of the natural lens and is usually an age-related phenomenon. Cataract is also seen in younger individuals where it can be congenital, drug induced, or related to trauma or ocular inflammation. Senile cataract is the most common type and causes gradual and progressive loss of vision and, if untreated, can lead to blindness. In the UK 30% of people aged over 65 years have significant cataract in one or both eyes; an additional 10% of this age group will already have had cataract surgery performed in one or both eyes. The prevalence increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Reidy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reidy 1998</LINK>). The only recognized treatment available for cataract involves surgery. In a national survey conducted from 1997 to 1998, phacoemulsification was the method of surgery used in 77% of the 18,454 patients treated in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1999</LINK>). The superiority of phacoemulsification over conventional extracapsular cataract surgery in terms of safety and cost effectiveness is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Minassian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minassian 2001</LINK>). The percentage of cataracts treated with phacoemulsification has steadily increased over the years and more than 99% of cataract operations in the UK are now completed using this technique (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2005</LINK>). Phacoemulsification is performed through a small self-sealing incision, which usually does not require suturing and can be performed without disturbing the conjunctiva. The use of foldable and injectable implants means that the original incision requires little or no extending. In 2002 to 2003, 270,000 phacoemulsification procedures were performed in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-RCO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCO 2004</LINK>). It is the most common elective (non-emergency) surgical procedure performed. It is anticipated that a further 225,000 new cases of visually-impairing cataract will be identified every year (<LINK REF="REF-RCO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCO 2004</LINK>). In the USA more than one million cataract operations are performed per year.</P>
<P>There are currently several options for anaesthesia in cataract surgery. General anaesthesia has a well-established role when local anaesthetic is deemed unsuitable. General anaesthesia is still possible in the day case setting (<LINK REF="REF-Moffat-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffat 1995</LINK>) but it does decrease turnover and increase costs. Local anaesthetic is widely used and peribulbar and retrobulbar injection methods deliver the anaesthetic agent with a sharp needle in the spaces around the eyeball. There are reported cases of vision and life-threatening complications with this procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1994</LINK>). There is an ongoing Cochrane review comparing peribulbar and retrobulbar anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Alhassan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhassan 2002</LINK>). The anaesthetic can also be delivered in the sub-Tenon's space using a blunt cannula. This requires incising the conjunctiva to gain access to the sub-Tenon's space. There is a Cochrane review comparing sub-Tenon's anaesthesia versus topical anaesthesia for cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>). Subconjunctival injection of anaesthetic agent in the region of the planned incision immediately prior to surgery may have a role in phacoemulsification surgery by employing a 'scleral tunnel' but its role in corneal section surgery is at present unclear.</P>
<P>Topical anaesthesia for phacoemulsification was popularized by <LINK REF="REF-Fichman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fichman 1992</LINK>. Topical anaesthesia involves instilling anaesthetic eye drops in the fornix prior to and during surgery. Longer established methods require an injection of anaesthetic agent in either the retrobulbar or peribulbar spaces and these injections have been associated with vision and life-threatening complications such as globe perforation, retrobulbar haemorrhage, optic nerve trauma, brainstem anaesthesia and extraocular muscle injury (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1993</LINK>). Topical anaesthesia has increased in popularity in recent years as this method is more cost effective and provides for more rapid postoperative visual recovery without diplopia or ptosis. This has found large acceptance especially in the USA where it is used by 61% of cataract surgeons (up from 8% in 1995, 51% in 2000), particularly those undertaking high-volume surgery. Of those using topical anaesthesia, 73% used it with intracameral lidocaine (from 81% in 2001) (<LINK REF="REF-Leaming-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaming 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients undergoing topical anaesthesia often report discomfort at certain points of the surgery, usually during either direct iris manipulation or movement of the iris diaphragm, as a result of rapid hydrodynamic changes. Whilst topical anaesthesia provides for corneal anaesthesia it is thought that intracameral anaesthesia may reduce any discomfort that may be caused by manipulation of intraocular structures. The rationale for using supplementary intracameral lidocaine is to provide anaesthesia for these intraocular structures. The anterior chamber (camera) of the eye is bounded by the cornea anteriorly and the lens posteriorly. This is the working area for instrumentation during cataract surgery. Intracameral anaesthesia involves the intraoperative administration of anaesthetic agent into this chamber.</P>
<P>These anaesthetic modalities have been combined with oral or intravenous sedation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>There is a considerable amount of published data comparing topical anaesthesia alone to topical anaesthesia with intracameral anaesthesia for phacoemulsification. These data indicate conflicting outcomes. We conducted this systematic review to analyse the results of different trials, to collate information regarding the value of this additional intervention and to help guide cataract surgeons and patients in their choice of anaesthesia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Glossary of terms</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Phacoemulsification: This refers to the modern form of small incision sutureless cataract surgery. It involves the introduction of a phacoemulsification probe into anterior chamber of the eye. the lens is removed through a process dependent on high frequency ultrasound energy to sculpt and emulsify the exposed lens. A foldable synthetic lens is introduced through a small incision into the anterior chamber. It is then positioned to replace the cataractous lens.</LI>
<LI>Extracapsular: large incision cataract surgery involving stitches. This has now been largely replaced by phacoemulsification in the western world but is still used in a small proportion of cases where phacoemulsification would be impossible or presents an unacceptable risk.</LI>
<LI>Peribulbar anaesthesia: anaesthetic administered outside the orbital muscle cone.</LI>
<LI>Retrobulbar anaesthesia: anaesthetic administered more posteriorly and within the muscle cone.</LI>
<LI>Subconjunctival: under the membrane lining the eyeball.</LI>
<LI>Intra-cameral anaesthetic: anaesthetic directly administered into the front chamber of the eyeball.</LI>
<LI>Sub-Tenon's anaesthetic: anaesthetic administered underneath the deep lining layer of the eyeball.</LI>
<LI>Scleral tunnel: surgery that involves opening the conjunctiva; the surgery is performed with instruments passing through a tunnel fashioned within the sclera.</LI>
<LI>Fuch's endothelial dystrophy: A degenerative condition affecting the corneal endothelium that is characterized by a decreased corneal endothelial cell count and impaired physiological functioning. Patients with Fuch's endothelial dystrophy are at high risk of corneal decompensation after phacoemulsification</LI>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently reviewed any titles and abstracts resulting from the searches. We obtained and assessed full text copies of possibly and definitely relevant trials according to the definitions provided in the 'Criteria for considering studies for this review'. We assessed only the trials meeting these criteria for methodological quality. We contacted the study corresponding authors for any necessary clarification of details in order to make a complete assessment of the relevance of the study.

<P>We assessed trial quality in accordance with the methods set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We used four categories of assessment to determine methodological quality: selection bias (allocation concealment); performance bias (masking of participants and researchers); detection bias (masking of persons assessing the outcome) and attrition bias (intention-to-treat). Each component was graded A: adequate; B: unclear; or C: inadequate as outlined in the Cochrane Anaesthesia Group's methods and statistics guidelines. We assessed the trial quality independently and resolved disagreements either by discussion or by consulting additional referees. We were not masked to any trial detail during the assessment. We contacted study authors where a decision regarding the classification of a study was hampered by lack of information.</P>
<P>We independently collected data using pre-specified data collection forms developed by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group. We compared data and resolved disagreements by discussion.

For dichotomous outcomes we presented data as odds ratios and when the outcomes were small in number, we employed a peto odds ratio. For continuous outcomes we employed the weighted mean difference. We used a fixed-effect model unless significant heterogeneity was encountered, in which case we used a random-effects model. We explored heterogeneity between trial results using a chi-squared test. If heterogeneity was detected either by the test or clinically within the trials, we made a note in the text of the review. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of including or excluding trials graded as inadequate on any parameter of quality.</P>

<P>The original searches were undertaken in June 2006 and yielded a total of 1558 studies matching the predefined search parameters. These were then screened by two review authors and complete copies of 17 studies were obtained for further assessment. Of these, eight studies were deemed suitable for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crandall-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Crandall 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gillow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gills-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gills 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tseng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tseng 1998</LINK>).

<P>All of the studies were assessed on four criteria for possible bias.</P>
<P>Both authors independently assessed study quality according to the criteria defined in Section 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The four categories of assessment were as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment. Was the randomization process concealed from those undertaking the research?</LI>
<LI>Performance Bias. This relates to the masking of recipients and providers of care.</LI>
<LI>Detection bias. Were persons responsible for outcome assessments unaware of the assigned treatment?</LI>
<LI>Attrition Bias. This refers to the completeness of follow up and intention-to-treat analysis of patient data.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Each variable of trial quality was graded as: A: adequate; B: unclear; or C: inadequate. Disagreements between the two authors were resolved by discussion. Where trial details were deemed 'unclear'", the trial authors were contacted for further information.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment. This was generally well performed, although the precise details of the process were often unclear. After contact with the authors four studies were assessed as Grade A: adequate and five studies were deemed to be Grade B: unclear. No studies were judged not to have performed allocation concealment or to have performed it inadequately.</LI>
<LI>Performance bias. Seven studies were deemed to have performed Grade A: adequate masking, with one study deemed Grade B: unclear. No studies were classified as Grade C: inadequate.</LI>
<LI>Detection Bias. In eight of the studies the details of detection concealment were deemed Grade B: unclear. Only <LINK REF="STD-Gillow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gillow 1999</LINK> was assigned Grade A: adequate.</LI>
<LI>Attrition Bias. All of the studies had a very similar rate of loss to follow up. These studies demonstrated either very small loss to follow up rates or no loss at all. All of the studies were therefore assessed as Grade A: adequate.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Of additional note is the disparate numbers between the randomized groups in <LINK REF="STD-Gills-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gills 1997</LINK> where 183 patients were assigned to the topical with intracameral anaesthesia group and 120 assigned to the topical anaesthetic only group. Although the trial described an appropriate randomisation technique there was no information in the publication to explain this. The authors were contacted but were unable to offer any further information.</P>

Although the resultant data were derived from a 10-point ordinal scale, These data were analysed as continuous data as outlined in the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for long ordinal scales (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). These data demonstrated that there was a statistically significant benefit resulting from the use of intracameral preservative-free 1% lidocaine (P = 0.001).

The vast majority of these patients scored zero, that is to say they did not experience any pain at all.

The analysis of these three trials demonstrated no significant association between postoperative cell counts and either the topical alone or the topical with intracameral anaesthesia groups. It is of importance to note that this comparison generated a significant heterogeneity coefficient (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67.4%) and the results must, therefore, be treated with caution. The marked variability for postoperative endothelial cell counts in different trials probably reflects the highly operator-dependent nature of calculation of endothelial cell density.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Five of the trials considered in this review employed the same scale to measure discomfort, making direct comparison more meaningful. The remaining trials used heterogeneous methods and were analysed as dichotomous data. Both of these analyses strongly support the use of intracameral lidocaine as an effective adjunct to topical anaesthesia. When considered together, these trials provide robust data to support the use of intracameral lidocaine as an adjunct to topical anaesthesia. However, we note that the differences in pain scores were based on skewed data; the pain scores for both groups were consistently low, with the vast majority of scores being either one or zero. A smaller number of trials measured postoperative pain and found no significant difference between the topical only and topical and intracameral groups. </P>
<P>Five trials recorded whether any supplementary anaesthesia was needed during phacoemulsification. No difference was identified between the groups in relation to the need for supplemental anaesthesia. This means that using topical anaesthesia alone, rather than topical with intracameral anaesthetic, does not lead to an increased chance of using supplementary anaesthesia.</P>
<P>No significant difference in supplemental anaesthesia rates between the groups was identified despite a significant difference in subjective pain scores. This is likely to be a reflection of the low pain scores in both groups and indicates that, despite a significant reduction in pain perception in the intracameral lidocaine group, the pain scores in the topical only group were still low enough to obviate the need for supplemental anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Although the toxic effects of anaesthetic agents on the corneal epithelium have been well characterized (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenwasser-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenwasser 1989</LINK>), much less is known about their effects on the corneal endothelium. Some studies have suggested that intracameral lidocaine can produce significant endothelial cell loss and corneal oedema in a rabbit model. However, these effects appeared to be associated only with higher concentrations of anaesthetic and the effects were transitory (<LINK REF="REF-Judge-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Judge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kadonosono-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadonosono 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1998</LINK>). An attempt was made by four of the trials included in the review to identify any corneal toxicity by using a variety of endpoints such as corneal pachymetry, endothelial cell counts and anterior chamber inflammatory activity. No difference was found between the treatment and control groups in terms of these endpoints. Individual studies have independently found that the use of intracameral anaesthesia does not produce any measurable ocular toxicity and this meta-analysis supports this conclusion. However, adverse effects of lidocaine on the cornea and retina have not been conclusively ruled out due to heterogeneity of measurement outcomes in the included groups. These results must, therefore, be taken with caution. </P>
<P>Five trials specifically recorded any intraoperative complications and we have found that the choice of anaesthesia does not predispose to adverse surgical events during phacoemulsification. Whilst complications were uncommon in both of the study groups, there was no increased risk of intraoperative complications for either the topical alone groups or topical with intracameral anaesthesia groups. </P>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of intracameral lidocaine as a supplement to topical anaesthesia for small incision phacoemulsification cataract surgery. The combined data from the trials we have identified supports the efficacy of intraoperative intracameral lidocaine supplementation for intraoperative pain relief. Our data also supports the safety profile of lidocaine supplementation with regard to adverse surgical events. We have not found any toxic corneal effects from the use of intracameral lidocaine, although this is not conclusive.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We have found that intracameral unpreserved 1% lidocaine is an effective adjunct to topical anaesthesia in phacoemulsification and significantly reduces intraoperative pain, although the effect is small. The use of topical anaesthesia alone was not found to lead to a higher chance of either intraoperative complications or need for intraoperative supplemental anaesthesia. We have also found that the use of intracameral lidocaine did not subject the cornea to toxic injury. Topical anaesthesia is becoming increasingly popular as an effective, safe, minimally invasive and low-cost anaesthetic option for rapid turn-over cataract surgery. Our data suggest that an assessment of the risks and benefits of using supplementary intracameral anaesthesia supports its use for phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We have demonstrated that data from a number of randomized controlled trials supports the effectiveness of adjunctive intracameral preservative-free 1% lidocaine for cataract surgery under topical anaesthesia. This may mean that any further studies comparing the anaesthetic effects of adjunctive intracameral lidocaine with a placebo control group may be considered unnecessary.</P>
<P>However, further research directed specifically to investigate adverse effects of intracameral anaesthesia might help to better determine the safety profile of this intervention. More objective techniques for assessing corneal toxicity, such as corneal pachymetry and specular microscopy with automated cell counting, are becoming more readily available and these standardised objective techniques should be employed to reduce measurement heterogeneity.</P>
