<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know which antibiotic was more effective in treating sore throats caused by bacteria (group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS)).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Most sore throats are caused by viruses, but many people carry throat bacteria, sometimes causing bacterial throat infection.</P>
<P>GABHS infection can have serious complications including rheumatic fever and kidney disease. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications, but provide modest benefit for sore throat, even if GABHS are present. Most throat infections are self-limiting and complication risks is extremely low for most people in high-income countries. However, sometimes antibiotics are needed. Penicillin, a cheap antibiotic, has been used to treat GABHS for many years. GABHS resistance to penicillin is rare.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature to March 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 19 trials (18 publications) that involved 5835 people. Trials studied different antibiotics for people with sore throat who tested positive for GABHS, and were aged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only children; and nine included people aged 12 years or older. Most studies were published over 15 years ago; all but one reported on clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>Thirteen trials were supported by drug study funding - some received grants - others included people employed by drug companies. Five studies did not report funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic effects were similar, and all caused side effects (such as nausea and vomiting, rash), but there was no strong evidence to show meaningful differences between antibiotics. Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.</P>
<P>All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk remains high. Our review supports the use of penicillin as a first choice antibiotic in patients with throat infections caused by GABHS.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence quality was low or very low for all outcomes when macrolides or cephalosporins were compared with penicillin. Evidence quality was downgraded because of concerns about randomisation and blinding, wide confidence intervals (estimates were not very precise) and statistical differences among studies that may impact on the validity of the estimate. Most study authors did not report enough information about methods to be sure there was no bias.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-08 18:09:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-07-30 13:16:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-29 16:41:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-11 11:32:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs).</P>
<P>There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-10 15:21:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-10 16:41:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-10 16:37:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Pharyngitis is a common upper respiratory tract infection. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat this condition. Patients usually consult a physician with the complaint of sore throat. A previous Cochrane review comparing the effect of antibiotics to placebo in participants with or without GABHS sore throat pointed to the self-limiting nature of an acute sore throat (even in cases of positive GABHS culture) (<LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2013</LINK>). Antibiotics provide only modest benefit when prescribed for sore throat. The effect of antibiotic treatment was increased in participants with positive throat swabs for GABHS. The streptococci-positive participants are only a small proportion of all participants with sore throat. Nevertheless, in many countries antibiotics are prescribed for most people who have a sore throat (<LINK REF="REF-Cars-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cars 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linder 2001</LINK>). Given the high consumption of antibiotics for this condition, a rational approach would be to reserve treatment with antibiotics for participants with proven presence, or a high likelihood of GABHS (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2001</LINK>). However, clinical scoring systems are somewhat limited in their ability to correctly target GABHS-positive patients (<LINK REF="REF-McIsaac-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIsaac 1998</LINK>), and the usefulness of rapid assay tests depends on the prevalence of GABHS in the population (<LINK REF="REF-Sonnad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonnad 1999</LINK>); justification of its cost-effectiveness is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuner 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-10 16:40:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The slight benefit of treatment with antibiotics in patients with GABHS sore throat may be considered relevant. When antibiotics are indicated, a choice needs to be made. In that case, several aspects need to be considered, such as the comparative benefit-harm balance, costs, and local antimicrobial resistance patterns. Many guidelines recommend penicillin as a first choice, with erythromycin preferred for people who are allergic to penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2001</LINK>). To date, resistance of GABHS to penicillin has only been documented incidentally (<LINK REF="REF-Devi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2014</LINK>), and resistance to erythromycin is still low (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2001</LINK>). Considering the growing problem of antibiotic resistance for other pathogens, this responsiveness of GABHS should not be endangered (<LINK REF="REF-Wise-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wise 1998</LINK>). Penicillin and erythromycin are cheap and the most cost-effective option. Despite this, physicians continue to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, including recently marketed ones. It is not clear if these antibiotics have any substantial clinical benefit over penicillin (and erythromycin).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-10 16:41:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Internationally, guidelines recommend using penicillin as first choice when choosing to treat people with acute sore throat (suspected to be caused by GABHS) with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Matthys-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthys 2007</LINK>). However, some argue that cephalosporins are more effective and should therefore be preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>). Many physicians argue that occurrence of penicillin allergy should be taken into account when making a choice for an antibiotic. This review looked for evidence of penicillin allergy occurring in the available trials. In addition, in the presence of documented penicillin allergy, the side effect profile of eligible antibiotics can guide choice. Therefore, to provide healthcare providers with sufficient information to make an evidence-based choice, both treatment benefits and adverse events are compared.</P>

<P>Two review authors (MVD, NK) assessed the methodological quality of the included trials by using Cochrane's risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The same review authors independently assessed each trial. We assessed risk of bias for: selection bias (random number generation and allocation concealment), performance and detection bias (blinding), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting).

<P>We pooled dichotomous data using a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We created summary of findings tables for the following comparisons: cephalosporin versus penicillin (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) and macrolide versus penicillin (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-07-30 15:52:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We stratified the trials into subcategories according to the comparisons between different classes of antibiotics. For each comparison we reported and pooled the predefined outcomes, if possible, in a meta-analysis. We performed subgroup analyses for trials with children versus adults.</P>
<P>We reported ITT data for clinical outcomes and analysis of evaluable participants (i.e. only including in the analysis participants for whom outcome reporting was complete) to illustrate any differences between analysis methods. Analysis of relapse incidence was analysed by including only evaluable participants; an ITT analysis would have seriously overestimated the importance of relapse, and results would not be relevant to clinical practice.</P>

We also performed sensitivity analysis by applying both random-effects and fixed-effect models in the absence of statistical heterogeneity (I &lt; 20%). A meaningful sensitivity analysis was only possible for resolution of symptoms in the comparison of cephalosporin versus penicillin.</P>

<P>All trials included only participants with confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-11 12:04:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Our meta-analysis found generally low quality evidence (as per the GRADE assessment) that did not show clinically important differences in clinical outcomes when different classes of antibiotics were compared with penicillin in adults and children with pharyngitis caused by GABHS.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Resolution of symptoms</HEADING>
<P>ITT analysis did not show any difference in resolution of symptoms between cephalosporins and penicillin<I>.</I> When only evaluable participants were included in the analysis (i.e. participants for whom an outcome was known) there seemed to be a benefit of cephalosporins over penicillin with regard to resolution of symptoms after treatment (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20). Subgroup analysis of adults and children (aged between one month and 17 years) did not reveal any significant differences, but this could be attributed to lack of sufficient power.</P>
<P>ITT analysis of carbacephem versus penicillin showed a benefit of carbacephem with regard to resolution of symptoms after treatment (NNTB 14.3). There was no significant benefit in the (large) adult subgroup, and the effect may be largely based on an observed effect in children (aged between six months and 12 years) (NNTB 8.3). The analysis of evaluable participants only did not reach statistical significance (but the estimated NNTB was likely to be high).</P>
<P>Pooling of trials comparing macrolides with penicillin did not result in any differences between groups in terms of resolution of symptoms. Only one unpublished trial in children aged between two and 12 years that compared a single dose of azithromycin with 10 days of amoxicillin found that more children on azithromycin were cured after 24 to 28 days than with amoxicillin. However, this effect was no longer significant in the ITT analysis.</P>
<P>Other comparisons with penicillin (clindamycin or sulphonamides) did not report clinical outcomes for this meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relapse</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of relapse in evaluable participants seemed to be lower in participants treated with cephalosporins compared with penicillin, but the event rate was low (approximately 3.5%) and the NNTB quite high (NNTB 50). There were no differences in relapse rate between other antibiotics and penicillin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events occurred at a similar rate in all treatment groups, except children treated with macrolides, who seemed to experience more adverse events than children treated with penicillin (although this difference was not statistically significant, most likely due to insufficient power) or amoxicillin or ampicillin.</P>
<P>The results of our meta-analysis need to be considered in the context of morbidity (including serious complications) prevalence, concerns about rising antibiotic resistance, and economic constraints in all healthcare systems.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Penicillin allergy</HEADING>
<P>Incidence of penicillin allergy was poorly if at all reported in the included trials. When a rash is reported in the penicillin group this is often also reported in the comparator group. The limited information about penicillin allergy may reflect the low incidence in the general population. <LINK REF="REF-Albin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albin 2014</LINK> found that penicillin allergy was reported in 11.5% of patients in a retrospective chart review, but only 11.8% of those with a documented allergy had experienced an anaphylactic reaction. The incidence of true anaphylaxis has been reported as less than 0.01% (<LINK REF="REF-Battacharya-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battacharya 2010</LINK>). It is also possible that patients with known penicillin allergies were excluded from the trials resulting in a low incidence of allergies during the trial. This exclusion was only explicitly mentioned in a few of the included studies.</P>

As an analysis of unpublished data used in Cochrane Reviews suggested that searching for unpublished data generally does not uncover new data that are important to the conclusion of the review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Driel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Driel 2009</LINK>), the lack of further unpublished data may not have had an important impact on the results of our review.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis focused on clinical outcomes. Reviews that report bacteriological outcomes point to the superiority of cephalosporins over penicillin with regard to eradication of GABHS (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>). However, this does not take clinical presentation into account. <LINK REF="STD-Gerber-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerber 1999a</LINK> found no difference in bacteriologic treatment success rates between cefadroxil and penicillin groups among participants classified clinically as likely to have true GABHS pharyngitis, but cephalosporins seemed to be more successful in eradicating GABHS in patients classified as clinically likely to be streptococcal carriers. Contamination of treatment groups by such chronic GABHS carriers contributes to the apparent superiority of cephalosporins in studies focusing on bacteriological outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 2004</LINK>); this is of very limited clinical relevance. To our knowledge, chronic streptococcal carriage is not linked to higher risk of developing GABHS pharyngitis, and hence eradication of streptococci in carriers is not a treatment goal. Information on complications is scarcely reported and therefore we could not draw any conclusions concerning this outcome.</P>
<P>Our review included studies involving children and adults, but age ranges of participants in each study varied widely, and there was significant overlap. Therefore, it was not always possible to perform subgroup analyses based on age groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions about specific age groups. This would have been clinically relevant because GABHS is more common in children aged between five and 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Worrall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worrall 2007</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-10 12:26:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>A strength of our review is that we included only randomised and double-blinded trials. This was intended to minimise risk of bias related to participant selection and reporting of outcomes. However, in spite of the lower risk of bias due to methodology, reporting of findings and transparency of analyses in the trials were often unsatisfactory. Patient characteristics were poorly reported and outcomes, poorly, or not at all defined. Dropout rates in some studies were very high (&gt; 20%).</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias in included studies was difficult to assess because the process of randomisation and blinding was not described in most studies. For instance, only four studies described the method used to conceal allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Randolph-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Randolph 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is surprising that resolution of sore throat, a key symptom in GABHS pharyngitis and important reason for patients to consult their doctor (<LINK REF="REF-van-Driel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Driel 2006</LINK>), was only reported as a separate outcome in one study (<LINK REF="STD-McCarty-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">McCarty 1992a</LINK>). Most studies however, assessed our primary outcome which is a composite endpoint consisting of a combination of symptoms including sore throat, fever, and feeling unwell. This is of course also of clinical relevance to patients.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the pooled evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was low for all outcomes in the comparison of macrolides versus penicillin and low or very low for the comparison cephalosporins versus penicillin. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly because of lack of, or poor reporting of randomisation, or blinding, or both, heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-02 14:52:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Pooling of outcomes was hampered by differences in outcome definitions among studies. Because most trials measured clinical outcomes within two weeks of the end of antibiotic treatment, they were pooled for the outcome resolution of symptoms post-treatment. The trial that reported symptom resolution within the first 24 hours of treatment was considered separately. Very few trials reported on specific symptoms related to acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Because symptom resolution is a subjective outcome, the interpretation may differ among trials, and pooling may therefore be inappropriate. However, differences between comparison groups in the same trial were not affected because they were measured in the same population.</P>
<P>We used ITT analysis of the selected outcomes for our meta-analyses. However, this may have underestimated the efficacy of treatment. Most trials reported numbers of participants randomised, but included only the evaluated participants in the outcome analysis. When reported, a common reason for post-randomisation exclusion was negative throat culture, suggesting that another pathogen caused the signs and symptoms of acute tonsillopharyngitis. Including these GABHS-negative participants in the analysis could bias the results if exclusion was not similar in both treatment groups. Some trials reported exclusions per group and show that this is not the case. When comparing two efficacious treatments this potential underestimation did not seem relevant because it did not influence conclusions. However, for trials that did not report this, it was not possible to know if selective exclusions occurred. We checked if the analysis method influenced outcomes by performing both ITT and analysis of evaluable participants for the outcome resolution of symptoms post-treatment. This showed different results in two comparisons. When cephalosporins and penicillin were compared, ITT analysis yielded a non-significant result, whereas analysis of evaluable participants showed a benefit of cephalosporins over penicillin. The opposite occurred in the analysis of effect on the same outcome in participants treated with carbacephem versus penicillin; where ITT analysis showed a statistically significant difference and the evaluable participants analysis did not, most likely due to a reduction in the number of participants included in the analysis (resulting in reduced statistical power). Analysing only evaluable participants implies a high risk of bias as there may have been a selective dropout. On the other hand, the ITT analysis can be considered as a conservative estimate of the true effect.</P>
<P>The estimated odds ratios (ORs) suggested that large benefits could be expected when treating patients with cephalosporins or carbacephems. However, these supposedly impressive effects expressed as a relative measure of risk (ORs) do not always translate into a clinically meaningful difference. For example, the estimated OR of 0.55 for the incidence of relapse in cephalosporins compared with penicillin, suggests that the risk of relapse could be halved by treating patients with cephalosporins. However, the associated absolute risk difference is 0.02, resulting in a NNTB of 50, which means that 50 patients need to be treated with broad-spectrum, more expensive antibiotics to prevent one additional relapse.</P>
<P>Calculating the absolute risk difference and the NNTB is therefore a useful method to assess the clinical importance of a relative risk. The interpretation of the NNTBs (how many patients needed to treat is acceptable) is, however, not clear-cut and depends on assessment of benefit and harm and also cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>All trials in our review were performed in high-income countries. The incidence of suppurative and other complications (which are rare in high-income countries), as well as antimicrobial resistance rates, may be different in low-income countries or specific communities with high prevalence of GABHS tonsillitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hanna-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanna 2010</LINK>). Therefore, studies performed in low-income and high-prevalence communities are needed.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-02 14:53:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We found that although there seems to be some benefit of antibiotics with a wider spectrum, such as cephalosporins and carbacephem, this observed effect is not consistent across analysis methods and subgroups. Cephalosporins showed benefit regarding resolution of symptoms only in the analysis of evaluable participants, and carbacephem is superior to penicillin for this outcome only in the ITT analysis (attributable to an effect in children treated with a carbacephem). The NNTBs associated with the observed effects were relatively high (20 for treatment with cephalosporins compared with penicillin), except perhaps for the effect of carbacephem in children (NNTB 8.3). There was no clinically meaningful difference between penicillin and the other classes of antibiotics studied with regard to rate of clinical relapse. However, cephalosporins seemed to reduce the relapse rate (NNTB 50), especially in adults (NNTB 30).</P>
<P>The effects observed in cephalosporins and carbacephems and not in the other antibiotic classes can be explained by the fact that although they are considered different classes of antibiotics, carbacephems chemically closely resemble cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unpublished study, <LINK REF="STD-NCT00643149" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00643149</LINK>, concluded that a single dose of azithromycin was superior to 10 days of amoxicillin in children. However, the analysis was based on a per protocol population that had completed at least eight days of treatment. Results were based on those patients who responded bacteriologically, thus censoring patients with strains resistant to the allocated antibiotic. Because eradication rates were higher in the azithromycin arm this may have biased the analysis. The ITT analysis, which underestimates the effect, did not show any difference between groups. In addition, amoxicillin may not be an appropriate choice for the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis/tonsillitis, considering the implications of using wide spectrum antibiotics on resistance in the community.</P>
<P>Interpretation of these findings for clinical practice is not straightforward. One could argue that our meta-analysis points to a superior efficacy of cephalosporins over penicillin, especially in adults where the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) is 1.01 (P = 0.06) in the ITT analysis. The population size may not have been large enough to reach statistical significance. This finding is in line with an earlier review concluding that cephalosporins are superior to penicillin in treating GABHS pharyngitis, and therefore cephalosporins should be considered first choice (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>). However, in our review the absolute difference between the cephalosporin or penicillin, although not statistically significant, was 2.5%, which implies a NNTB of 40. Treating 40 patients with cephalosporins instead of penicillin would incur additional costs to healthcare systems and add to the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, especially in broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins.</P>
<P>The observed superior effect of cephalosporins in reducing the rate of relapse has been reported elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>). However, in our review it is only observed in adults and may be biased by the rather liberal definition of relapse in the study that accounts for 49% of weighting in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Nemeth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nemeth 1999</LINK>); "worsening of, or absence of significant remission of, signs and symptoms 17 to 24 days post-therapy or need for further AB therapy", whereas in other studies "recurrence of symptoms" after initial remission was required. The NNTB of 33 participants that need to be treated with cephalosporins rather than penicillin to prevent one participant experiencing relapse illustrates the limited clinical relevance of this statistically significant result.</P>
<P>How can the differences between Casey's meta-analysis and ours be explained? <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK> included 35 trials; two-thirds were not blinded and reporting of randomisation and losses to follow-up was very poor, implying a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2004</LINK>). By restricting inclusion to double-blinded trials we ruled out one source of potential bias and improved methodological rigour. The <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK> subgroup analysis of double-blinded studies generated an OR similar to ours (although with a much narrower CI: OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.71), but included studies with carbacephems, which have been advertised as a separate class of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK> reported an analysis of evaluable patients, whereas ITT analysis may be more appropriate especially with important numbers of dropouts (which is the case in many of the trials included in our review). The trial populations included in <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>, as in ours, may have been contaminated with chronic carriers of GABHS who had intercurrent viral pharyngitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2004</LINK>), but it was not clear if this has implications for clinical practice. <LINK REF="REF-Gerber-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 1999b</LINK> argued that the superior effectiveness of cephalosporins over penicillin observed in some studies may reflect a greater ability to eradicate the streptococcal carrier state rather than actual superior effectiveness of "bona fide acute GABHS pharyngitis".</P>
<P>We found no differences in the incidence of adverse events, and data on long-term follow-up and occurrence of complications were insufficient. Therefore, costs and antimicrobial resistance patterns are important in making treatment choices.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-10 15:22:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Our review did not find clinically important differences in clinical outcomes when different classes of antibiotics were compared with penicillin in adults and children with pharyngitis caused by GABHS. The finding that carbacephems and cephalosporins may have some benefit over penicillin in terms of resolution of symptoms and incidence of relapse was inconsistent across analysis methods (only statistically significant for the evaluable patients analysis) and the NNTB was substantial. This is not compelling evidence to alter current guideline recommendations for treatment of patients with GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Moreover, we found no clinically important differences in occurrence of adverse events, and data on the incidence of complications were too few to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>Antibiotics have a limited effect in the treatment of patients with acute sore throat, even in the presence of GABHS. However, if antibiotics are to be prescribed, based on these results and taking into consideration the costs and antimicrobial resistance patterns of different antibiotics, penicillin can still be considered a first choice treatment for both adults and children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-02 14:15:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The observed differences in clinical efficacy between adults and children needs further exploration. The currently available studies include different age ranges which makes it difficult to identify differential effects in various age groups. Individual patient data were unavailable; therefore, future studies reporting effects in distinct age groups may provide clinically relevant information. Prevention of serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis are often mentioned as arguments in favour of antibiotic use. However, the current data do not provide information about the impact of different antibiotics for prevention of complications. Further studies with longer follow-up may be able to address this issue. Because these complications seem to be more prevalent in low-income and high-risk communities (for example, Australian Indigenous communities), studies in these specific high-risk communities are needed. Economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of different treatment options may provide additional guidance for making treatment choices.</P>

<P>In the 2010 review, outcomes were split into primary and secondary. The composite outcome 'resolution of symptoms' was included as a primary outcome.</P>
<P>In the 2014 update, the risk of bias assessment tool was changed from the Jadad score to the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We also included a GRADE assessment using the GRADEPro software and added a description of the GRADE assessment of the overall quality of the evidence to the methods section and text of the review.</P>
<P>Following advice from the Statistical Editor, we changed the analysis method for pooling to a random-effects model as the default. To be consistent with our protocol (<LINK REF="REF-van-Driel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Driel 2003</LINK>), we also used a fixed-effect model if there was no substantial heterogeneity, and compared results in a sensitivity analysis. This was mentioned as a sensitivity analysis in the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-van-Driel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Driel 2003</LINK>) and is now described in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section as a subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses for adults and children where appropriate because this is relevant to clinicians; this was added to the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis: Our protocol planned sensitivity analyses for patients in different settings, per carrier status, or diagnostic criteria (throat culture or rapid test), publication status (published versus unpublished studies, studies published as abstract versus full text articles, year of publication). These were replaced with sensitivity analysis of the impact of heterogeneity and of applying a random-effects and fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis according to methodological quality rated on the Jadad score (<LINK REF="REF-van-Driel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Driel 2003</LINK>) was abandoned with the introduction of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment.</P>
<P>The 2016 author team was changed to include Sarah Thorning as an author. Natalja Keber no longer contributed to the review and was removed as an author.</P>
<P>The outcome 'incidence of relapse' was added to the Summary of findings table for cephalosporins compared to penicillin.</P>

<P>Our 2012 review update used the search strategy described below. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012, Issue 10, part of <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>www.thecochranelibrary.com (accessed 19 October 2012), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to October 2012) and Web of Science (2010 to October 2012).</P>
<P>In 2010 we searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 4, 2010) and EMBASE (1974 to August 2010).</P>
<P>The following search strategy was used to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. The MEDLINE search terms were combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (Lefebvre 2009). The search terms were adapted for EMBASE (Appendix 3).</P>
