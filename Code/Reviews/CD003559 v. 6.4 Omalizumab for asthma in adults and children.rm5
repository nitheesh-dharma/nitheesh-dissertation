Well done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note to Emma and Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think all the points raised by Haydn have now been fixed. Plaese see track changes. Many thanks, Steve and Becky 2 September 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 25/06/2013 Re-ordering and revision of text in conjunction with Becky. SoF table one has a line added to reflect the results in patients of all severity, and the severe asthma subgroup has been downgraded to low for exacerbations due to imprecision of the results. I wonder if other bias could be removed from the Risks of Bias? I need to pick up again from overall completeness and applicability of the evidence! The discussion may need updating with the two new references to EXCEL which looked as predictors of response? Date of access of websites also need to be added. Why is double dummy comparison with ICS needed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 18 06 2013 I have put Dorenbaum and Hanania 2013 as additional references to Hanania 2011 (EXTRA). Also added the new reference to Geveart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC notes 10/06/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the work you have done on this substantial update. The review has increased in complexity, to the degree that it is very hard to distil a clear simple message from it. I wonder if it needs a major prune of existing material that is no longer up to date. For example the background in the abstract could be reduced to a couple of short sentences about the current place of Omalizumab in guidelines (such as NICE 2013)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key questions are: 1) Does the trial evidence show important benefits or harms of Omalizumab overall. This is a clear yes for the primary outcomes. 2) What evidence do we have from patients with the severity of asthma that the guidelines recommend for treatment. Here the answer is very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present the asthma severity, co-interventions etc. appear right from the start. This makes the results and discussion tough for the reader to get their head around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we simplify the results and the discussion to address these two main questions for the primary outcomes. First does it work overall, and then add the rider about limited evidence in the relevant patient group (in view of the current guideline recommendations)? The second point is important for application of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma has suggested that answering the second question could best be achieved with a sensitivity analysis, leaving out the trials on milder patients. There is just insufficient evidence on the guideline-appropriate patient group to tell if the benefit is the same as it is in patients with milder asthma. This matters quite a lot because the treatment is so expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma J notes 6/6/13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Please can you add the date accessed for those refs highlighted yellow please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) I've amended the ref EMA 2012 - can you check that I've done it correctly please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3) Please complete PRISMA (Liz to insert). &lt;/span&gt;Liz; Have put in a PRISMA diagram but there are some boxes to complete: Steve &amp;amp; co please fill in highlighted boxes. cheers. 13/06/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 29/05/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve mentioned how tricky it was putting this review together - I can see that! There are a few improvements I think you could make to help the reader through all the data. It's in good shape, but with a little bit of explanation here and there and a reconsideration of how the different severities of asthma are presented, the review could be a lot better and easier to read. Writing Cochrane reviews from the point of view of the subgroup analyses is not encouraged (see excerpts from the Cochrane handbook below) and the presentation of data by subgroups in this review makes it hard to unpick what is happening. The assignment of severities is subjective (being based on mean attributes of the patient populations for individual trials) and as Chris says above this doesn't really get at the question of what data there is to support (or refute) the guideline recommendation to give omalizumab to people only with severe asthma. I started trying to figure what was going on for myself and noticed a few things that made me question the subgroup approach e.g. looking at table 2: a) Busse 2011 - participants judged as mild, moderate and severe steps 1-6 broken down into steps 1-2 and 4-6. This is not a category on the subgroups used in meta-analysis; b) Ditto Lanier 2009 had patients BTS stage 1-6 - it was not included in analysis 1.1 - why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggest one, two or both of the following approaches a) add an overall forest plot for each of the primary outcomes (at least) to pool all the possible data and then present the subgroup analyses afterwards; or b) perform a sensitivity analysis removing data from all those trials where the participants would not be eligible to receive omalizumab in clinical practice. It may also be helpful to add another table to indicate which outcomes were reported by each trial. Steve - maybe you Chris and I could discuss this next time when you are down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;be consistent mcg vs iu vs ug vs &amp;#956;g (latter preferred)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove the term 'asthmatics' as people are not defined by their disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;needs a find and replace for the following +/-, &amp;gt;/=, &amp;lt;/= etc. symbols are available by clicking the omega button in the toolbar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;each section of the review should be ordered by the outcomes you have chosen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;could do with a spell check&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The highlighted sentences in 'data collection' belong in the results section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include a little more information about the characteristics of the participants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain language summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I appreciate you haven't yet looked at this since the original version, this is not in plain language! Please follow the PLEACS standards and re-write under headings to break the text up http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/mecir. Happy if you want to sort the rest of the review first and do this later&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the highlighted part of 'description of the condition' belongs under the heading 'description of the intervention'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what is a normogram? explain in the review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omalizumab (also referred to as rhuMAb-E25, rhu-Mab or Xolair in the literature) - this bit comes too far down. The information in the background looks good, but it doesn't flow perfectly under the headings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'types of participants' includes information about subgroup analyses - please remove&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;included studies - reads strangely because co-interventions are explained in great detail before the amount of omalizumab is even stated - be upfront about why&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;headings. I took the trials out of the headings as they were loooooooooooong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the primary outcome is reduction in use of steroid - this should be reported first and the other data follow in the order of the outcomes listed in the methods section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exacerbations - these need defining - we usually define on need for oral steroids, hospitalisations etc as you have done in the outcomes - however when you get to the results it is unclear and simply stated exacerbations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Match the headings in the text to the headings of the forest plots. It's close, but not quite,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;analysis 1.1 - pooled total reported in the text, but the total was turned off (I turned it on for you). Check that this is not done for any of the other forest plots - and if there is a reason not to pool, state it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasserfallen asthma score is in data and analyses 1.11 - but not in the text as far as I can see and is not an outcome - this should be included and discussed if it was a prespecified outcome and removed if it wasn't. Global evaluation rather good to excellent - also not a pre-specified outcome. I have not seen area under the curve before - perhaps this merits explanation of what it shows beyond FEV1?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;turned some of the totals off as there was only one trial e.g. 2.3 and 2.3 - please check through the rest and turn off any other totals as necessary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;delete forest plots with no data e.g. 3.2 and 3,3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lung function&amp;gt;subcutaneous&amp;gt;change from baseline PERF - what does IV stand for here or is it a typo? Write out in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All analyses must be linked and it must be made clear which studies and how many participants contributed to which outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;There were significant reductions in symptom scores from baseline in favour of Omalizumab in two trials (SOLAR (-1.8, P = 0.023); INNOVATE (P = 0.039, no mean scores presented).&amp;quot; is this a mean difference between the two groups? please state&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9.3 area under the curve - the figures are so large the CI won't fit on the diagram. What are the units? Why are they so different? is the level at different time point to do with absorption?Ditto 10.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;there are several vague statements about the new studies 'generally supporting the above'. It's impossible to tell which elements of the above. Secondly, the results and discussion should discuss the totality of the evidence, not trying to split it into the 'old' and 'new' studies which are dichotomised arbitrarily by the time at which the last Cochrane review was done. You can explain what has changed between the old and new review in the 'what's new' section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;typo: &amp;quot;Table 4 and &lt;a link_type=&quot;TABLE&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;04&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There shouldn't really be any text under the heading discussion - the first part of the discussion is a summary the main results. Can you move the text down under the other headings in the discussion section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove info on Jadad as we don't use that scale any more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Djukanovi 2004 - says unpublished data only, but there is a full paper on this - can you check the assignment as 'unpublished data' this seems unlikely to me. Can you check whether the assignment to published/unpublished is correct for all references&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handbook excerpts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.6.3 Meta-analyses within subgroups and meta-analyses that combine several subgroups are both permitted. It is tempting to compare effect estimates in different subgroups by considering the meta-analysis results from each subgroup separately. This should only be done informally by comparing the magnitudes of effect. Noting that either the effect or the test for heterogeneity in one subgroup is statistically significant whilst that in the other subgroup is not statistically significant does not indicate that the subgroup factor explains heterogeneity. Since different subgroups are likely to contain different amounts of information and thus have different abilities to detect effects, it is extremely misleading simply to compare the statistical significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.6.5.5: Many characteristics that might have important effects on how well an intervention works cannot be investigated using subgroup analysis or meta-regression. These are characteristics of participants that might vary substantially within studies, but which can only be summarized at the level of the study. An example is age. Consider a collection of clinical trials involving adults ranging from 18 to 60 years old. There may be a strong relationship between age and intervention effect that is apparent within each study. However, if the mean ages for the trials are similar, then no relationship will be apparent by looking at trial mean ages and trial-level effect estimates. The problem is one of aggregating individuals&amp;#8217; results and is variously known as aggregation bias, ecological bias or the ecological fallacy (Morgenstern 1982, Greenland 1987, Berlin 2002). It is even possible for the differences between studies to display the opposite pattern to that observed within each study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.6.6 - see this whole section, but this excerpt in particular: It must be remembered that subgroup analyses and meta-regressions are entirely observational in their nature. These analyses investigate differences between studies. Even if individuals are randomised to one group or other within a clinical trial, they are not randomised to go in one trial or another. Hence, subgroup analyses suffer the limitations of any observational investigation, including possible bias through confounding by other study-level characteristics. Furthermore, even a genuine difference between subgroups is not necessarily due to the classification of the subgroups. As an example, a subgroup analysis of bone marrow transplantation for treating leukaemia might show a strong association between the age of a sibling donor and the success of the transplant. However, this probably does not mean that the age of donor is important. In fact, the age of the recipient is probably a key factor and the subgroup finding would simply be due to the strong association between the age of the recipient and the age of their sibling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 21st Cates plots updated. The durations need to be checked for these and SoF with new trials added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26th Statistical editing by CJC. The **OLD** Exacerbation analyses are wrong because the P values do not come from a test of differences between exacerbation rates (as opposed to ratios), nor do they come from parametric test results and therefore cannot be back-calculated into RevMan. For this reason I have asked Steve to remove 1.3, 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24 from the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 1st CJC has moved the new outcome of rate of exacerbations requiring OCS to 1.2, added clinically important subgroups (post hoc note), and marked the outcomes with ***OLD*** to be deleted later. I suggest we move Comparison 3 up to number 2. I do not think intravenous or aerosolised treatment have any current clinical place, and maybe these could be moved down to the bottom of the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HI Toby,&lt;br&gt;Well I am pleased he feels the review is much improved. I as agreed that the mismatch between research and clinical use is a big problem but hope this may be a bit clearer following recent editing. There are some specific points that could be addressed for the BMJ paper and the next update. I agree that 118 reduction needs to be in relation to the doses of steroid used in each arm. I also agree with Neil's request to remove severe from step 2/3, and that the sub-grouping according to steroid doses would be useful, starting with zero ICS (new studies) and then grouped by BDP equivalent dose as this would be more informative to the reader than mild/moderate/severe. Recommendations for further studies at step 4 to 5 could be made clearer, and lack of efficacy on oral steroids should be mentioned in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;I would also recommend restructuring the results in the text to group all the outcomes for s/c treatment together and then I/V etc. At present the outcome determines the structure of reporting rather than the type of Rx.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==================================================&lt;br&gt;210206&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br&gt;I have amended the methods and quality sections with the new studies. The additional tables are only for the studies with background steroid therapy, so the new trials (i.e. Bruno, Hanf and van Rensen) would not be relevant here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is otherwise OK - can I upload it for submission?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=====================================================&lt;br&gt;21/2/06&lt;br&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;br&gt;This is almost ready to be submitted. Can you check under Description of Studies again. I have amended the total to 3143 but I do not think the new studies have been incorporated in the routes of administration section? Also the adult and paediatric lists do not include the latest studies. Methodological quality also needs the new studies to be incorporated please. Additional tables 9,10,11, 13 and 14 also need the new studies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next update I would suggest keeping the results of s/c and I/v treatment as separate subheadings for the first two comparisons in the text (as you have done for the non-steroid comparisons), as this would make it easier for the reader to absorb the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have moved the cost sentence to the front of its paragraph in the discussion as the next sentence flow from this. I have also included the range of costs (which depend on number of amps per month not frequency of use). Although the only outcome to show significant differences between subgroups is 1#1, the current data on oral steroids is thin (to say the least) so an extra rider about this group is now in red later in the same para.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will you have time to sort out the data from the new studies as above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;=======================================================&lt;br&gt;17/2/06&lt;br&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;I cannot compare changes on Archie at present but the changes to the results read well. I have added a few changes in red to emphasise the costs of treatment (which is the main issue in terms of balance with clinical benefit). Can you ask Sam about point 4 from Graeme in terms of the annual cost and licensed use of Omalizumab in the UK. Otherwise we await Neil on Monday but this should be ok to get onto the next submission. I have not rechecked all the results again.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;07/02/2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris - some minor changes to results based on identification of three small studies in mild asthma (Bruno 2005; Hanf 2005; van Rensen 2005). Only a few changes added to text - nothing of note in the Discussion section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;15 studies, 55 references&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Peer review comments from Graeme Currie with CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please find attached my comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main points are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) There is no QUOROM flow diagram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The results section is rather long and tedious, perhaps&lt;br&gt;some of this could be shortened or ideally tabulated or put&lt;br&gt;into figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The paper needs a table showing the demographics of all&lt;br&gt;the 12 trials included in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) It would be worth mentioning the actual cost of Omalizumab&lt;br&gt;and what its licence status is at the moment in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for asking me to look over this interesting&lt;br&gt;paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graeme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;I think that given the tickness of the soup, we are looking at something akin to yellow split pea, with an extra spoonful of cornflour for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Response to CJC's comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have asked Neil Barnes to look at this - as yet no response, but will continue the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the data for mean exacerbation rate as per our conversation. See further comments in CAPS below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC 2 feb 06&lt;br&gt;The soup thickens. I have compared Table 100 from the FDA website with the results in 1#1 and for the stable steroid rows the number of patients are lower in Table 100 although the totals match. If table 1 is a correct ITT analysis should we be using these results (at least as a sensitivity analysis). ++I HAVE ADDED THESE AS 1#17 - NO BIG DIFFERENCE SO AT THE MINUTE NO ADDITIONAL TEXT IN THE RESULTS SECTION - IS THIS WORTH REPORTING STILL?++&lt;br&gt;I like the structure of the comparisons better but cannot see where you derive a mean difference of 0.15 for Holgate 2004a. Table 101 gives 0.78 and 0.36 - difference of 0.42, whilst Table 102 without imputation gives means of 0.42 and 0.31 - difference of 0.11? Are we using the protocol defined imputation data or the no imputation data in Table 102 ++AGREED HAVE CHANGED THIS++&lt;br&gt;Also for 3#1 according to Table 97 the Placebo group is 19/45 (not 19/50) for complete steroid withdrawal. ++NB - THESE DATA SHOULD NOT BE POOLED AS THE Y REFER TO ORAL STEROID WITHDRAWAL!++ The same table could be used to add data from Holgate 2004a to the next outcome 32/50 v 29/45 by adding the top three rows.++NB THIS IS % REDUCTION IN OCS - I HAVE NOT ADDED THESE DATA++&lt;br&gt;The document also draws out an important difference in exacerbation definition between Trial 11 (holgate 2004a) and trials 8 and 9 (Busse and Soler I think) with the latter including double dose ICS in their exacerbation definition. I HAVE ADDED SOME TEXT TO THE REVIEW RESULTS SECTION ON THIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it stands there is borderline heterogeneity between Holgate 2004a and the other subgroups for 1#1 (chi 5.82, df 2, P 0.054) and I-square 47%, which will need to be reported in the first para of results. ++I HAVE AMENDED THIS++ There are a variety of possible reasons including patient severity and exacerbation definition for this. In the end the second para in the discussion is well written and sums up the situation quite neatly.++THANKS - I WROTE THAT BIT. GOOD INNIT?++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Have deleted the data comparisons 17 &amp;amp; 18. I am not quite sure whether to subgroup the ICS &amp;amp; OCS users in the same severe category, so I have created an additional subgrouping in the analyses (See outcomes 1, 3, 4 &amp;amp; 5). No rate ratios are now pooled in the review - effectively the Humbert data stand alone (which I have no problem with) but it seems to me that all the decisions about treatment will be based on that one study, and because they did not want to give us the Ns exacerbating (presumably it will make their product look duff because of the imbalance between groups at baseline), we are left scratching our heads a little bit.....It is important to identify the various subgroups of severe asthma, as the defintion changes according to whether you assess baseline (i.e. untreated lung function) or whether you look at amount of medication requried to control asthma adequately or whether you look at symptom &amp;amp; exacerbation history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Thanks for this Toby,&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the data that you sent and am puzzled about how you derived the rate ratio for exacerbations for Holgate 2004a in comparison 1#17 and exacerbation rate SD in 1#18. Table 101 gives firm data for comparison of number of pts with one or more exacerbations and this could be added to 1#1 rather than the rate ratio comparison. I am not sure why the all patients pops up in #17 and #18 when you have put the 1#1 comparison separately for Holgate 2004A in the last 2 comparisons.&lt;br&gt;?rethink?&lt;br&gt;Can you clarify before I re-edit&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE FROM TJL&lt;br&gt;CJC update editing Jan 25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in RED ***** in text where action is required******&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: Please add something about contributions to the update? DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: Helpful but please name the 3 studies, number of patients in each and do you mean oral steroid dependent or ICS dependent? ICS - THIS IS NOW IN THE RELEVANT SECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Placebo added to abstract. Please confirm that all trials did compare with placebo? See Table of studies below.- AYE - THEY WERE ALL PLACEBO CONTROLLED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Can Liz check these please? OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Please add details of placebo treatment for the included studies. Humbert does not specify route of administration of treatments. DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: ****I am not sure why you mention the countries of icense? Either remove this or you need to explain that the license is restricted (in the UK not for children or mild asthma and only at specific IgE levels I believe). ++HAYDN THOUGHT THAT SOME DETAIL ON WHERE THE DRUG IS CURRENTLY LICENSED WAS HELPFUL IN THE BACKGROUND SECTION. INITIALLY I LEFT THE DETAIL AT THE LEVEL OF 'THIS DRUG HAS A RESTRICTED LICENSE, BUT THEN HE WANTED SOME INFORMATION ON WHERE IT WAS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE, SO I INSERTED INFO I GOT FROM THE NOVARTIS WEBSITE++Also the first para reads as if IgE is uniformly raised in all asthmatics and I do not think this is true. Could this be made more clear please. ++I HAVE ADDDED 'IN SOME......WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED TO STUDIES CONDUCTED TO DATE' Raised IgE is an inclusion criterion in most of the studies which could also be made clear at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fine. Some Minor changes in red. ***Toby could you add the citation for my website as a reference for the calculation of NNT in methods please*** DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies: Good. **** Could you add something about the range of IGE levels in the text (I know it is in Table 2) and what the normal range is?****** I THINK THE CONCEPT OF NORMAL WITH IGE IS DIFFICULT TO DEFINE - MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS SOME WITHIN PATIENT VARIABILITY HERE DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR ALLEGEN ONE IS SENSITISED TO - E.G. DURING THE BIRCH POLLEN SEASON, MY IGE LEVEL IS (PROBABLY) UP, BUT GOES DOWN WHEN THIS IS OVER. IT COULD BE A QUESTION OF ALLUDING TO THE THRESHOLD VALUES REPORTED IN THE STUDIES, SO I HAVE RE-WORDED THIS PARTICULAR BIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ***Please explain why you need Table 9 and 10. Is this complementary to the Forest plots or data you could not use? This is not the primary outcome and this sentence and the following one about IgE levels would be better moved to the end of the results please.**** I SEE NO POINT IN THEIR EXISTENCE, BUT SAM FELT THAT THEY WERE IMPORTANT.&lt;br&gt;****Toby please check the Holgate 2004a Rate Ratio as it favours placebo. Is this correct??? This will alter the Chi result. If these patients are a subgroup of Holgate 2004 you cannot pool them together in outcome 17 unless you have separated out the non OCS and entered these only (in which case the number of patients is wrong for Holgate 2004. Can you clarify? Do you have the paper for this one? It is critical that we get the message clear about this study and the two types of patient results. This applies to 3#6 also so please check other comparisons. THESE DATA WERE REPORTED SEPARATELY IN THE UNPUBLISHED EFFICACY REPORT FROM THE FDA. SEE ATTACHMENT SENT THROUGH TO YOU ON 020206. I HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE RATE RATIO IS CLOSE TO THE RELATIVE RISK. IF THIS IS NOT THE CASE WE CANNOT POOL THE OUTCOME DATA, AND WE WILL BE RESTRICTED TO MAKE INFERENCES BASED ON WHAT THE 'POSITIVE' ANALYSIS SHOWS, AND WHAT THE SEPARATE MEASUREMENT OF LIKELIHOOD OF EXACERBATIONS WAS IN ONE SMALL ADDITIONAL UNPUBLISHED STUDY. I AM HAPPY FOR EITHER SCENARIO AND WOLD LIKE YOU STATISTICAL INPUT HERE! THE EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF XOLAIR IN OCS DEPENDENT ASTHMA IS NOT GREAT, AND WE CAN RETAIN THAT ARGUMENT WHETHER THE UNPUBLISHED HOLGATE DATA ARE IN THE RATE RATIO OR SEPARATE REATIVE RISK COLUMN.&lt;br&gt;****Rescue medication in text is 4 studies and this falls between outcome 5 and 6 for comparison 1 - please clarify? THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED - OUTCOME 6 HAS MORE DATA IN IT.&lt;br&gt;****I do not see a Forest plot for oral steroid withdrawal in comparison 3 for Holgate 2004a, can you add this data in text or on a graph. This is also important! Results just say no difference (CI would be useful) - THESE ARE REPORTED IN COMPS 11 &amp;amp; 12...I THOUGHT WE DIDN'T REPORT DIFFERENCES FOR SINGLE STUDIES?&lt;br&gt;****See above re 3~6 and subgroups for exacerbations. SEE COMMENT ABOVE RE: WHETHER THE DATA ARE DRAWN FROM SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR VARIABLES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Good I agree with the suggestion re use in stage 5. There is a mismatch between trials on moderate patients and licensed use in severe patients I think. Holgate is different for ICS reduction as there were higher doses used (not due to smaller numbers which widen CI and reduce the heterogeneity in fact). I have amended this.&lt;br&gt;****?Meaning of sentence in para 4? HAVE CHANGED THIS TO REFLECT THAT THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACEBO EFFECT ASSOCIATED WITH RX.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our own classification of the studies included in this review failed to identify a consistently different response to therapy in Holgate 2004; Holgate 2004a and Humbert 2005 and those of the other studies&amp;quot; ***THIS IS NOT TRUE IN 1#17 IF YOUR DATA IS CORRECTLY ENTERED****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAYBE NOT IF DATA FROM HOLGATE 2004a ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****PLEASE ADD SOMETHING HERE ON LICENSED USE AT DIFFERENT STEPS OF TREATMENT**** I HAVE ADDED SOME RED TEXT ON THIS - THIS IS A FARILY SENSITIVE ISSUE SO CAN YOU READ IT TO MAKE SURE WE WON'T GET SUED?&lt;br&gt;Study design should try and overcome the confounding effect of improved adherence to ICS therapy which was evident in the studies reviewed, due to the intensity of study monitoring. *****HOW?**** Exploain or leave out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: The discrepancy between Holgate 2004a and the other studies is notable for this update. WE NEED TO GET THE DATA RIGHT AND REPORT CAREFULLY&lt;br&gt;Cost of treatment? Aims of treatment? Long term safety of stopping ICS? Severity of patients who were treated.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I AGREE - BUT THESE ARE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES FOR THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES RATHER THAN THE REVIEW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMplications:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Data from Phase III trials have shown that the drug has a small inhaled steroid-sparing effect. &amp;quot; I have removed small!!&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;clinical trials of more realistic trial design, which assess the long term use of Omalizumab&amp;quot; I have removed more realistic trial design unless you can suggest one!&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;double dummy 'head to head' comparison of Omalizumab versus other potential steroid-sparing agents, with and without long acting beta agonists in combination with inhaled corticosteroids&amp;quot; removed second part as covered by first half of sentence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked : done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : This is a really important update. Can you attend to the comments above? Then could you ask Neil Barnes to run his eye over it as peer review before submission (or someone else if he has not got time).&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;**************************************************&lt;br&gt;TJL: New data from Holgate paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;CJC edit 19 March 2004&lt;br&gt;I am happy with this.

Amended and now ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;___________________&lt;br&gt;TJL 280503&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following peer reviewers' comments on the review the following sections have been amended to reflect the patient populations recruited to the studies and the generalisability of the trials:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Results - entered line at start of paragraph: 'Eight trials were included in the review, contributing a total of 2037 mild to severe allergic asthmatic participants with high levels of IgE' FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies:&lt;br&gt;Amended subheading on asthma type to 'asthma type and severity'. Expanded the section to include reference to entry criteria, baseline steroid consumption and variation in asthma severity within and between the studies; created additional table with baseline IgE levels. AMENDED SLIGHTLY TO IDENTIFY ADULTS AND CHILDREN AS WELL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results and Discussion:&lt;br&gt;Removed references to heterogeneity - we have an inadequately powered subgroup analysis and not clinical discrepnacies between the subgroups. FINE&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A pooled analysis of moderate to severe/severe patients showed an average reduction of one exacerbation per five participants over the course of the trials in favour of Omalizumab (fixed effects WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.09). &amp;quot; A FIFTH OF AN EXACERBATION IS UGLY!&lt;br&gt;AUC data for FAHY given correct units also. CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;Added a paragraph on identifying responders (this is located at the bottom of the discussion section):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry criteria for the studies required evidence of sensitivity to aeroallergens and raised levels of IgE which may not be representative of the asthmatic population in general. Results from this review show that a significantly greater proportion of patients were able to withdraw or reduce their inhaled corticosteroids; however, there were also a large proportion of patients who showed little or no response to Omalizumab. It is not clear from studies published so far why some patients respond and some do not, and it is therefore difficult to extrapolate the positive findings of this review to the general asthmatic population. Given the time consuming and costly nature of the treatment, and in order to target patients who are most likely to benefit, it is important that future studies focus on methods of identifying potential responders. FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took out the waxing lyrical and replaced it with more firmly grounded observations based on the assembled evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Omalizumab is a novel approach to the management of chronic asthma that is as yet unlicensed for clinical use. Phase III trials have shown the drug to be an useful steroid sparing agent in the short to medium term though data on long term safety and efficacy are needed. Since it is anticipated that Omalizumab will be an expensive treatment option, it will be important to determine which patients would benefit most from its use. The majority of patients recruited to the studies suffered from moderate to severe allergic asthma. Assessment of treatment in more exclusively severe allergic asthmatic patients on high doses of inhaled and oral steroids has been undertaken in one trial and the results from this study require confirmation in additional trials. The cost benefit ratio for less severe patients requires assessment. The drug has only been evaluated in one paediatric trial and it would seem unlikely to be readily recommended for use in children based on results of one trial. Omalizumab might also prove useful to asthmatics with troublesome rhinitis and eczema and in the management of IgE-related anaphylactic reactions.' FINAL SENTENCE REMOVED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for research still stand I feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;6th August, 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Haydn,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your comments on this review - we have amended the discussion section as you have asked. In addition we have now been more consistent with labelling the graphs. The synopsis needs to be in plain language and this will be reviewed by a consumer as well as Chris Cates before it goes to Paul. Explanation of heterogeneity has been moved to the discussion section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;7th November, 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Haydn,&lt;br&gt;Thanks once again for the comments - Sam and I have amended the review. There are one or two comments we were unable to respond to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i) Your comment on the presentation of dose units - we were quoting source material and as such we found it difficult to present the data in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii) Exacerbation rates - we looked at the original papers but none cited run-in or previous exacerbation rates in terms of means and SDs. One paper (Milgrom 2001) did cite 18 and 9 in the active and control groups children as having been hospitalised in the previous year for asthma. The ratio of randomisation was 2:1 so these numbers represent equivalent exacerbation rates in the two groups. Would you still like us to insert these in the results section?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That aside we have overwhelmingly agreed with your very helpful and insightful comments on this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks and best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10_12_2002 Technical editing by CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors Contribution: Toby could you add the co-reviewers to the second reviewers screen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: #1~4 and ~5 labels in opposite directions so both cannot be correct! Could you increase the scale in the Graphs where the CI goes way off screen (Comparison 2 for example), and reduce it in #4~4, and #5~3 to show the CI?I suggest that #6~4 be changed to WMD as the scales are both puffs per day, (also #6~7?). I assume that #6~5 should be AUC for FEV1, please relabel.&lt;br&gt;Could you either use Peto or OR throughout (eg #7~1 is not Peto in Metaview at present). There is also some inconsistency in axis labels - some say treatment others specify the drug. Please tidy this too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to Toby to decide on which OR to use, and whether WMD instead of SMD as suggested above, and then I will check the results in the text against Metaview.&lt;br&gt;Sent to toby on 10_12_2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17 12 02&lt;br&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the comments - I have revised the scales on the graphs. I have a query over the Peto OR - I looked through all the outcomes for binary data but could not find a reference to a Peto OR. I double-checked the text both with and without find and replace and could not find 'Peto' in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added the co-reviewers to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also amended the WMDs for rescue medication usage and checked the results - strangely the results are almost exactly the same for stable and reduction phases. I have double-checked the means and SDs: they are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have gone through the axes and amended them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10/12003 CJC relook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toby, could you renumber the outcomes to fill in the gaps (eg there is no 2 or 3 for comparison 1)? It would also be helful to renumber the comparisons to reflect the order of reporting in the text (ie putting the IV data at the end not at the beginning please).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome 4~6 was Peto by default on Metaview. (I agree Peto is not in the text). I have changed this to OR. Labels all look fine now - thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the symptom scores to match the WMD in Metaview&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SYMPTOM SCORES&lt;br&gt;Patients receiving Omalizumab had significantly fewer asthma symptoms during stable steroid phases in two studies in moderate-severe adult asthmatics (Sol&amp;#232;r 2001: p&amp;lt;/=0.001; Busse 2001: p&amp;lt;0.001 - no means and SDs published) and in a pooled analysis of these two studies, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in symptom scores in Omalizumab-treated patients compared to placebo (WMD -0.48 [95% CI: -0.67, -0.28], p&amp;lt;0.00001). There were no significant changes in asthma symptoms in the paediatric study (median nocturnal asthma scores were 0 in both groups throughout the study, Milgrom 2001). No data on symptom scores were available on severe asthmatics (Chung 2002).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the text results now match metaview. I have run spell check (picked up ug instead of mcg for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discussion with Paul, I have removed the p values for pooled results as the CI is the best measure to describe the uncertainty (group policy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I AM REASONABLY HAPPY WITH THE REPORTING OF OTHER OUTCOMES IN THE STEROID REDUCTION TRIALS (WHICH SHOW BENEFIT AS WELL AS REDUCED STEROID REQUIREMENT SO MAY BE OF INTEREST TO READERS AS SECONDARY OUTCOMES SHOWING THAT LESS STEROIDS CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH BETTER CLINICAL OUTCOMES AS WELL)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is now ready to go to Paul for peer review. Thanks for all your work on this Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE MAKE SURE THIS VERSION IS USED AS IT HAS BEEN SPELLCHECKED!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: =Anti-IgE for chronic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Anti-IgE for chronic asthma (WITH PAUL AND COPYEDITED)&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Anti-IgE for chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Anti-IgE for chronic asthma in adults and children (WITH CHRIS LAST GASP DATA CHECK)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-12-18 09:38:32 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="IGE-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.6 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.4">

<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effect of omalizumab on people with asthma when compared with placebo. We focused on whether omalizumab is a beneficial but safe treatment for adults and children with asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is thought that allergy may be an important part of the disease for many people with asthma. Omalizumab is a drug that targets a protein, called IgE, and removes it from free circulation in the body. IgE is centrally involved in allergy. Omalizumab is an expensive drug that is usually given by injection under the skin every two to four weeks. It is licenced for use in asthma sufferers who are not being adequately treated with standard therapy and who require frequent courses or continuous use of oral steroid tablets. We looked for evidence on whether administration of omalizumab is better or worse than giving placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>Twenty-five studies, involving 6382 people, were included in this review. These studies lasted between eight and 60 weeks. All of the people included in the studies had asthma, of different severity. Both men and women were included, and some of the studies included children and young people.</P>
<P>All studies compared omalizumab versus placebo. In keeping with current medical practice, most studies (21 of 25) used omalizumab given by injection under the skin. Some of the older studies used omalizumab injected into a vein or given by inhalation. The evidence presented here is current to June 2013. Most of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>We found that people receiving omalizumab were less likely to have a flare-up (&#8216;exacerbation&#8217;) of their asthma. For example, on average, 26 of 100 people who were receiving placebo (over a 16 to 60-week period) had an exacerbation compared with an average of 16 of 100 people receiving omalizumab.</P>
<P>People receiving omalizumab were also more likely to be able to reduce the doses of inhaled steroids. For example, on average, 21 of 100 people with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving placebo were able to completely stop their inhaled steroids (over a 28 to 32-week period) compared with an average of 40 of 100 receiving omalizumab.</P>
<P>People receiving omalizumab also experienced improvement in their asthma symptoms and in their health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>People receiving omalizumab were no more or less likely to have unwanted side effects overall. However, people receiving omalizumab were more likely to have skin reactions at the site of the injection.</P>
<P>Perhaps unfortunately, many of the trials in this review included participants with moderate asthma, and this drug is not licenced for this group. More trials need to focus on whether this drug is effective in people with the most severe asthma; evidence for efficacy in this group is poor, in spite of current guidelines.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented in this review is generally of moderate quality. Most of the studies did not clearly explain how investigators decided which people would receive omalizumab and which would receive placebo, and this decision is an important part of well-conducted studies.</P>

<P>Asthma is a respiratory (airway) condition that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E<B> </B>(IgE). It is called an 'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add-on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials examining anti-IgE administered in any manner for any duration. Trials with co-interventions were included, as long as they were the same in each arm.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-12 10:23:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data. Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous and subcutaneous injection. The main focus of the updated review is subcutaneous administration, as this route is currently used in clinical practice. Subgroup analysis was performed by asthma severity. Data were extracted from published and unpublished sources.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-15 20:47:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In all, 25 trials were included in the review, including 11 new studies since the last update, for a total of 19 that considered the efficacy of subcutaneous anti-IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids.</P>
<P>For participants with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) therapy, a significant advantage favoured subcutaneous omalizumab with regard to experiencing an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.60; ten studies, 3261 participants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo with regard to reducing hospitalisations (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; four studies, 1824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. No separate data on hospitalisations were available for the severe asthma subgroup, and all of these data were reported for participants with the diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab were also significantly more likely to be able to withdraw their ICS completely than those treated with placebo (OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.00 to 3.13), and a small but statistically significant reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose was reported for omalizumab-treated participants compared with those given placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -118 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent per day, 95% CI -154 to -84). However, no significant difference between omalizumab and placebo treatment groups was seen in the number of participants who were able to withdraw from oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.63).</P>
<P>Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids required a small but significant reduction in rescue beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist medication compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.39 puffs per day, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.24; nine studies, 3524 participants). This benefit was observed in both the moderate to severe (MD -0.58, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.31) and severe (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.10) asthma subgroups on a background therapy of inhaled corticosteroids; however, no significant difference between subcutaneous omalizumab and placebo was noted for this outcome in participants with severe asthma who were receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer serious adverse events were reported in participants assigned to subcutaneous omalizumab than in those receiving placebo (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 15 studies, 5713 participants), but more injection site reactions were observed (from 5.6% with placebo to 9.1% with omalizumab).</P>
<P>To reflect current clinical practice, discussion of the results is limited to subcutaneous use, and trials involving intravenous and inhaled routes have been archived.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-12 10:23:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalisations as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled steroids and during steroid tapering phases of clinical trials. Omalizumab was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their inhaled steroids. Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, although more injection site reactions were seen with omalizumab. Further assessment in paediatric populations is necessary, as is direct double-dummy comparison with ICS. Although subgroup analyses suggest that participants receiving prednisolone had better asthma control when they received omalizumab, it remains to be tested prospectively whether the addition of omalizumab has a prednisolone-sparing effect. It is also not clear whether there is a threshold level of baseline serum IgE for optimum efficacy of omalizumab. Given the high cost of the drug, identification of biomarkers predictive of response is of major importance for future research.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-12 10:23:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is an airway disease that currently affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It is a heterogenous disease characterised by recurrent dyspnoea, wheezing, cough and chest tightness and usually is associated with reversible airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Pelaia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelaia 2011</LINK>). Active asthma accelerates the development of fixed airflow obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Perret-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perret 2013</LINK>). The mainstay of modern treatment has been the use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilator drugs. Although this approach has been useful in the management of mild and moderate forms of the disease, patients with severe asthma sometimes require oral steroids and other immunosuppressive regimens with their attendant side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>). In addition, people with poorly controlled asthma, even in spite of treatment, are at increased risk of hospitalisation and emergency room visits (<LINK REF="REF-Chipps-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chipps 2012</LINK>). Although this group accounts for only around 5% of people with asthma, it contributes to approximately 80% of the economic costs of asthma; therefore novel therapies have been developed for optimal treatment of these patients. It is estimated that more than 50% of people with poorly controlled asthma have allergic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated asthma and therefore may benefit from treatments targeted at IgE.</P>
<P>It is becoming increasingly apparent that &#8216;asthma&#8217; is not a single condition but rather a collection of symptoms caused by different mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Haldar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haldar 2008</LINK>). This heterogeneity in asthma expression appears to be multi-dimensional, including variability in clinical, physiological, age of onset and pathological parameters. Confirmation of evidence of distinct and different combinations of symptom expression and underlying inflammation may require a different approach to therapeutic intervention that may clarify the role of omalizumab in clinical guidelines in the future.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:49:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a central role in the development of allergic diseases, including allergic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>). In atopic (allergic) individuals, initial exposure/sensitisation to an allergen initiates a complex series of events, leading to the production of allergen-specific IgE. The IgE becomes attached to inflammatory cells such as mast cells (in particular), basophils and macrophages via its Fc portion linking with Fc receptors. Further allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging between allergen and IgE on the surface of these effector cells (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wills_x002d_Karp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills-Karp 1999</LINK>). This results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of proinflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, chemokines and cytokines. In some people with allergic asthma, higher than normal IgE levels may increase persistent airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sears-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1991</LINK>), presumably through ongoing chronic allergic activation of this complex system. Indeed, the level of circulating IgE to common allergens is a risk factor for emergency admissions with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>). It is these people with high levels of IgE who have been featured in omalizumab studies conducted to date.</P>
<P>Omalizumab has been licenced for use since 2003 in the United States for people with moderate to severe asthma over the age of 12 years whose condition is inadequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. The European Medicines Agency followed suit in 2005 and more recently has approved the use of omalizumab in children six years of age and older (<LINK REF="REF-Pelaia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelaia 2011</LINK>). In 2006, omalizumab was included as an add-on treatment in Step 5 and above of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GiNA) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GiNA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GiNA 2011</LINK>). In April 2013, updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance suggested that omalizumab can be used in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids (usually accompanied by high-dose inhaled corticosteroid) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Omalizumab usually is considered only for those with allergic asthma who are sensitised to at least one aeroallergen and have circulating IgE levels within the specified range for determination of dosing.</P>
<P>Omalizumab is recommended to be administered as a subcutaneous injection. The dose and frequency of dosing are guided by a nomogram that is derived from the total serum IgE level and the body mass index. This is based on evidence that total serum IgE is a good predictor of clinical symptoms of asthma and correlates fairly well with the total number of immune cells in the body (tissue and circulation) that have functional cross-linking Fc-epsilon receptors. However, it is not well established whether at least some individuals with low or normal total serum IgE may also respond to treatment with omalizumab. In other words, it is not certain whether the level or the activity of IgE is the better determinant of the clinical efficacy of omalizumab in an individual.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-12 16:08:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Omalizumab (also referred to in the literature as rhuMAb-E25, rhu-Mab or Xolair) is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that recognises IgE at the same Fc site as the high-affinity receptor binding site. This anti-IgE antibody forms complexes with free IgE, thus blocking the interaction between IgE and effector cells. Omalizumab treatment also appears to down-regulate the expression of high-affinity IgE receptors on effector cells (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>). The complexes of omalizumab and IgE formed as a result of treatment are small and are not thought to be able to trigger complement activation or to give rise to immune complex&#8211;mediated pathology. Omalizumab has been shown to reduce serum concentrations of free IgE after a single injection, resulting in significant reductions in early and late asthmatic responses following allergen inhalation and improved asthma symptom control (<LINK REF="REF-Milgrom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milgrom 1997</LINK>). Recent studies also suggest that treatment with omalizumab may reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation and IgE-bearing cells, although effects on airway hyperresponsiveness and airway wall structural remodelling are less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-15 20:22:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Omalizumab is a recent addition to the range of treatments available for asthma, but it is much more expensive than alternative asthma treatments. In the UK, national guidance (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>) states: "Omalizumab is recommended as an option for treating severe persistent confirmed allergic IgE-mediated asthma as an add-on to optimised standard therapy in people aged 6 years and older: who need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids (defined as 4 or more courses in the previous year), and only if the manufacturer makes omalizumab available with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme." Little evidence has been found for this recommendation. Indeed, other international guidelines are less proscriptive and recommend this treatment for patients who remain suboptimally controlled after maximal therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators and other add-on therapies such as leukotriene antagonists, theophyllines or muscarinic antagonists.</P>
<P>To date, evidence is somewhat lacking about the efficacy of this drug in the more severe asthma population, as many trials include participants with mild or moderate disease. This review seeks to address whether omalizumab is safe and effective but with a particular emphasis on patients with more severe asthma&#8212;the group for whom the drug is licensed.</P>

<B>Study design and duration</B>
</P>
<P>All trials were randomised and double-blind and of parallel-group design. Twenty-two were reported in full; details of two of the remaining trials were available as clinical trial reports on the clinicaltrials.gov system (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00096954" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00096954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01007149" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01007149</LINK>),<B> </B>and one was reported as a conference abstract<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>). Study duration ranged from eight to 60 weeks. The trials fall broadly into three categories: those in which the background medication (referred to as 'steroid stable' if the background medication included a steroid) was unchanged, those with a steroid stable period followed by an attempt to reduce the background steroid dose ('steroid reduction') and those that sought to demonstrate a reduction in airway responsiveness to allergens after treatment with omalizumab.</P>
<P>Nineteen studies examined the efficacy of subcutaneous anti-IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Bardelas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bardelas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chanez 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gevaert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gevaert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INNOVATE" TYPE="STUDY">INNOVATE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massanari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Massanari 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00096954" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00096954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01007149" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01007149</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohta-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ohta 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLAR" TYPE="STUDY">SOLAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sol_x00e8_r-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Solr 2001</LINK>).

<P>Three routes of drug administration were identified: inhaled, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1999</LINK>); intravenous, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boulet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boulet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1999</LINK>); and subcutaneous injection, 21 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bardelas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bardelas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chanez 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djukanovic-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Djukanovic 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gevaert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gevaert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INNOVATE" TYPE="STUDY">INNOVATE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massanari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Massanari 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00096954" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00096954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01007149" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01007149</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohta-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ohta 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prieto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Prieto 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLAR" TYPE="STUDY">SOLAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sol_x00e8_r-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Solr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rensen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Rensen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all studies, anti-IgE was compared with placebo, although doses of omalizumab differed. The study using intravenous omalizumab in moderate to severe asthma compared high (5.8 mcg/kg/ng IgE/mL) and low (2.5 mcg/kg/ng IgE/mL) doses versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1999</LINK>); in the two studies that considered intravenous omalizumab in mild asthma, the comparison was 1.0 mg/kg versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Boulet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boulet 1997</LINK>) and 0.5 mg/kg versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1997</LINK>). Inhaled omalizumab was given at doses of 1 mg or 10 mg, and subcutaneous omalizumab at doses of 0.016 mg/kg/IU/mL every two to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1999</LINK>).</P>

Adults with mild asthma were recruited to <LINK REF="STD-Boulet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boulet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djukanovic-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Djukanovic 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1999</LINK>. Allergic and non-allergic patients with nasal polyps and asthma participated in <LINK REF="STD-Gevaert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gevaert 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>Asthma severity varied within and between studies. Subgroup analyses were performed according to asthma severity (severe, moderate/severe and mild asthma) as defined by the review authors (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Data on asthma severity according to author and review author classification are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Primary indicators of asthma severity were FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and baseline therapy. Our classification of severity is based on the stepwise guide to asthma management recommended in the <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2012</LINK> guidelines. We examined baseline steroid requirements and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (percentage predicted) to determine whether participants were largely mildly (step one of <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2012</LINK>), moderately (step two), moderately/severely (mixed population samples, step two/three) or severely asthmatic (step four and above). Following analysis of one participant population (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2001</LINK>), the review authors reclassified severity as moderate to severe (step two/three of <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2012</LINK>).</P>

All of these studies recruited severe high-dose inhaled steroid&#8211;dependent participants. <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004b</LINK> recruited participants who required high-dose ICS plus OCS to maintain asthma control and were classified as most severe (step five). We have undertaken analyses of exacerbations that both include and exclude the <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004b</LINK> study. Allergic and non-allergic patients with nasal polyps and asthma participated in <LINK REF="STD-Gevaert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gevaert 2012</LINK>, but details of participant severity were not reported.</P>
<P>Entry criteria for all studies included positive skin tests to common aeroallergens. Threshold ranges of IgE levels were a stated inclusion criterion in all studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Boulet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boulet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NCT01007149" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01007149</LINK>. Baseline IgE levels are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
</P>
<P>Outcome measures reported ICS or OCS withdrawal, mortality, asthma exacerbations, rescue medication use, lung function, quality of life, global evaluation of treatment effectiveness and adverse events. For each outcome, results are presented separately for any steroid stable phase (omalizumab given as adjunctive therapy to inhaled corticosteroids) and steroid reduction phase (omalizumab given during steroid reduction).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis </B>
</P>
<P>It was not possible to use the a priori subgroups as planned. Many studies included adults and children over 12 years of age but did not present results separately for the children. Only three studies focused exclusively on a paediatric or adolescent population (<LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK> included children six to 12 years of age, and <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2011</LINK> included participants six to 20 years of age). Subgroups were analysed separately for route of delivery of the trial medication, but to reflect clinical practice, we have moved the results of the intravenous and inhaled subgroups to <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. An attempt was made to analyse the results according to asthma severity; this is discussed under each outcome, when possible. Asthma diagnostic entry criteria did not prove to be a useful subgroup, as all studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>, enrolled only participants with proven allergic asthma and IgE levels within the specified range. We did not attempt subgroup analysis for duration of treatment.</P>

<P>In analyses based on asthma severity, we found that in participants with moderate/severe asthma and in those who were receiving background inhaled steroid therapy, a significant reduction in the odds of having an asthma exacerbation favoured subcutaneous omalizumab (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.60; seven studies, 1889 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, little effect, but with wide confidence intervals, was noted for omalizumab versus placebo in participants who were diagnosed with severe asthma and who were receiving background inhaled steroid therapy (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.99; two studies, 277 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), nor for those who were diagnosed with severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled plus oral steroid therapy (OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.13; one study, 95 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

For participants with severe asthma, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2011</LINK>) found significant benefit in favour of subcutaneous omalizumab for those who were receiving background therapy of both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, but again, more uncertainty surrounds those receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 13:56:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have reviewed the use of omalizumab in 25 randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 6382 people with differing asthma severity, with most suffering from moderate to severe disease. The trials reviewed varied in design, as described earlier. Treatment duration ranged between 8 and 60 weeks, and some studies included a steroid reduction phase between 8 and 16 weeks in duration. Most of the studies (21, n = 5975) used a subcutaneous route to deliver the drug. Currently, omalizumab is delivered exclusively by the subcutaneous route in clinical practice; for this reason, discussion of results from older studies of inhaled and intravenous administration has been moved to the appendices.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Omalizumab reduced exacerbations when assessed both as an adjunctive treatment and as a steroid-sparing agent in moderate to severe asthma. However, in the subgroup of participants with more severe asthma, including those requiring oral steroids, omalizumab had no significant effect on asthma exacerbations. The results presented here also suggest a reduction in hospitalisations for participants with moderate to severe asthma using omalizumab compared with those given placebo, but no data in this area are available for the more severe subgroup independently.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Steroid sparing effects</HEADING>
<P>Some people with more severe asthma depend on high doses of inhaled or oral corticosteroids to control their disease. Long-term oral steroid use is associated with many unwanted side effects, including hypertension, reduction in bone density, bruising, immune suppression, cataracts, growth failure and hyperglycaemia, among many others. Agents that allow asthma sufferers to reduce their daily steroid dose are therefore of great interest.</P>
<P>The reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose following treatment with omalizumab was clinically modest but statistically significant. The amount of variation in this outcome could be attributable to the higher doses of BDP equivalent inhaled steroid in <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004a</LINK> in relation to <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sol_x00e8_r-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Solr 2001</LINK>. It is noteworthy that participants treated with placebo were also able to reduce their intake of ICS by a significant amount, probably because of better adherence to the prescribed doses. The presentation of dichotomous data in the published studies and of unpublished continuous data in the FDA report has enabled us to look at the significance of both methods of measuring effects (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Treatment with omalizumab increased the likelihood of steroid reduction, but variable baseline steroid doses and a modest mean outcome difference in steroid consumption between treatment and placebo groups bring into question the true size of the steroid sparing effect of omalizumab.</P>
<P>Not all participants across the studies benefited from omalizumab treatment. Approximately 16% of severe participants achieved less than 25% reduction in daily inhaled steroid use over the steroid reduction phase. In the study involving paediatric participants, nine of 225 omalizumab-treated participants appeared to have needed the same amount or an increased amount of steroid therapy (reported as &lt; 0% reduction in steroid use) (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK>). It was not obvious whether these children had more severe asthma. These results confirm the need to better define which patients will benefit most from omalizumab treatment. It is important to note that not all asthmatic patients at the severe end of the spectrum who may benefit most from steroid reduction will respond to omalizumab treatment; this may reflect the heterogeneity of asthma aetiology and pathology, especially in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Asthma symptom scores were not reported by all included studies. Participants with moderate to severe and severe asthma receiving omalizumab were more likely to experience an improvement in their asthma symptoms, but this difference only reached significance in seven out of the eleven studies reporting this outcome.The heterogeneity of methods for assessing asthma severity prevented meaningful meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Health-related quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Significant improvements in health-related quality of life were observed with omalizumab compared with placebo.</P>
<P>A statistically significant improvement was noted in steroid stable studies of subcutaneous omalizumab for AQLQ scores in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, but this difference did not reach the validated clinically relevant effect size. In addition, Global Asthma Control scores improved significantly in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, but with a high level of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Further evidence of positive participant perception of omalizumab treatment was ascertained from pooled analysis of the results for global effectiveness of treatment from two trials involving subcutaneous omalizumab. Once again, improvements in global treatment efficacy and overall quality of life noted among control participants suggest that the basic trial design, which included close medical monitoring, might have contributed to a large placebo or more likely Hawthorne effect, mediated through improved adherence to medication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rescue medication use</HEADING>
<P>Participants receiving omalizumab were significantly more likely to be able to reduce their use of short-acting bronchodilators or &#8216;rescue medication&#8217;. This was true for participants with both moderate and severe disease but was not found for the relatively small number of more severely affected participants receiving oral as well as inhaled corticosteroid as background therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of lung function</HEADING>
<P>Pooled results showed consistent but very modest improvements in the treatment group when compared with the placebo group for the change from baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> predicted and morning PEF.</P>
<P>This is consistent with studies reporting no relationship between reduced hospital admissions and improved lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Qureshi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qureshi 1998</LINK>) and a poor association between lung function and health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wijnhoven-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijnhoven 2001</LINK>). It is not yet clear how such small improvements in lung function may equate to clinically relevant findings. The relationship between asthma disease severity and lung function requires further investigation. Given the context in which omalizumab has been assessed in this review, optimising background adherence to inhaled therapy may be more important than adding extra medication to achieve these modest improvements in lung function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>It appears that participants receiving omalizumab were less likely to experience a serious adverse event than those receiving placebo, with a low level of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 7%). Injection site reactions were more common in the omalizumab group, but this result also had a considerable degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 42%). Although no significant difference was seen between groups in the low mortality rates encountered, any advantage favoured omalizumab, as all four deaths occurred among participants receiving placebo (at least two not asthma-related, with no details provided regarding the other two).</P>
<P>Use of a humanised anti-IgE antibody has raised theoretical concerns about immune complex&#8211;mediated pathology and abnormal immune responses to parasitic infection. Administration of parenteral anti-IgE results in the formation of small immune complexes (&lt; 10 KDa), which are cleared through the kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Arshad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arshad 2001</LINK>). No reports have described immune complex&#8211;mediated side effects over up to 60 weeks of administration. Additionally, antibodies to omalizumab did not develop in participants treated with subcutaneous or intravenous omalizumab, although they occurred transiently in one participant who received inhaled anti-IgE therapy.</P>
<P>Further information is needed on the safety profile of the drug after long-term use and in different populations such as those with endemic parasitism. There is a theoretical potential that anti-IgE therapy may lead to increased risk of cancer because of the role of IgE in the immune response to neoplasia; again, longer studies are needed to further explore this possibility.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-12 16:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An important question is the place of omalizumab in the treatment of asthma according to current guidelines. NICE guidance recommends use only in patients with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids (i.e. step five of the BTS guidelines for asthma management in children and adults) (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). However, this is not strongly supported by the evidence. Few studies recruited only participants with severe disease, and thus our subgroups may not have been adequately powered to detect different responses. Moreover, the current data available in relation to participants on oral steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2004b</LINK>; 95 participants) are not sufficient to justify the extrapolation of our main findings to this group. Additional trials limited to this severe oral steroid&#8211;dependent population are required to determine whether they would benefit from omalizumab therapy.</P>
<P>Our own classification of the studies included in this review failed to identify a consistently different response to therapy for participants with differing disease severity, with the exception of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations in the steroid stable treatment group who were treated with subcutaneous omalizumab. In this important analysis, it appears that participants with more severe disease actually benefit less from omalizumab treatment, with a significant difference detected between the subgroups.</P>
<P>In addition, the steroid sparing effects of omalizumab, which could be important in severe asthmatic patients, who are at risk of serious side effects from daily use of high-dose inhaled steroids or oral steroids, were generally small. Such modest steroid sparing effects of omalizumab in moderately severe asthmatic patients have to be balanced against the cost of anti-IgE treatment. Studies with a steroid sparing phase of considerably longer than 16 weeks will be required to answer this question more definitively. Discontinuation of omalizumab treatment is associated with increases in circulating free IgE to prebaseline values within eight weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Casale-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casale 1997</LINK>). This implies that treatment would need to be continued long term for efficacy to persist, which has significant cost implications.</P>
<P>The cost of omalizumab ranges from approximately 1665 per patient per year for a 75-mg dose administered every four weeks to approximately 26,640 per patient per year for a 600-mg dose administered every two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Given the time-consuming and costly nature of the treatment and importance of targeting patients who are most likely to benefit, it is essential that future studies focus on methods of identifying potential responders. One of the challenges when treatment with omalizumab is considered is that to date, there is no reliable way of identifying those people before treatment is started. Four responder analyses with varying definitions of 'at risk' or 'severe' asthmatic participants have been conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Babu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Babu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holgate-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Holgate 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2004</LINK> reported that participants were more likely to respond to treatment if characterised by one or more of the following: low FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, frequent hospitalisation and high ICS dose (for additional information on these analyses, see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent logistic regression analysis from the EXTRA (<LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2011</LINK>) trial did not entirely support this previous work on clinical predictions of efficacy. In contrast, these trial authors suggested that preserved FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (&gt; 65% predicted) with no intubations for asthma in the preceding year but higher numbers of exacerbations requiring oral steroids in the preceding year was predictive of a better response. These authors speculate that this may indicate that omalizumab is most effective in individuals with uncontrolled disease but in whom irreversible airway remodelling has not yet occurred. Further work in this area would be justified. <LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2011</LINK> also attempted to identify biomarkers that would allow prospective prediction of likely response to omalizumab and suggested that elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophilia and serum periostin may predict a better response to omalizumab when compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Another study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2011</LINK>) carried out a rather different prespecified subgroup analysis to investigate potential responders. This study showed that omalizumab had a significant impact on asthma control and exacerbations in an inner city population of children and young adults with severe asthma but also suggested that it was more effective in those who are both sensitized and exposed to cockroach allergen. Compared with those who were neither sensitised nor exposed to cockroach allergen, people receiving omalizumab had bigger reductions in inhaled corticosteroid dose (P = 0.03) and asthma exacerbations (P = 0.06) and increased odds of not having an asthma exacerbation (P = 0.06). This may represent the beginning of an alternative approach to selecting patients for treatment with omalizumab that allows prior identification of likely responders, although, it is important to note, it is not clear from the paper or the supplementary appendices how many people in this study were actually both sensitised and exposed to cockroach allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2011</LINK>). Further validation of this approach is required.</P>
<P>Entry criteria for the studies in our review required evidence of sensitivity to aeroallergens and raised levels of serum IgE, which may not be representative of the asthmatic population in general. To date, most trials have excluded patients who do not have proven sensitivity to aeroallergens (i.e. non-atopic individuals), thereby raising questions about the generalisability of study findings to the asthmatic population as a whole. It is estimated that up to 50% of severe asthmatic patients are non-atopic. However, a recent small study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; n = 41) that enrolled non-atopic participants with severe asthma suggests that omalizumab may be effective in this population; larger studies are now required to confirm this finding,</P>
<P>The high number of screening failures in several studies is also noteworthy (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2001</LINK>: 1117 screened, 525 enrolled; <LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK>: 1433 screened, 628 enrolled; <LINK REF="STD-Sol_x00e8_r-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Solr 2001</LINK>: 1356 screened, 546 enrolled). IgE levels outside the range of those set as entry criteria were the most common reason for screening failure. Even within this selected stratum, there were participants who demonstrated little or no response to omalizumab. It is still not clear from studies published so far why some patients respond and others do not; it is therefore difficult to extrapolate some of the positive findings of this review to the general asthmatic population. <LINK REF="STD-Gevaert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gevaert 2012</LINK> suggested that 'local tissue' IgE may have a significant role in mediating airway symptoms in asthma, and therefore serum IgE, or sensitivity to aeroallergens, may not be a good predictor of response to treatment.</P>
<P>Most participants were adults or adolescents, with only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK>; n = 962) recruiting paediatric participants between five and 12 years of age. Most of the 'adult' studies included some participants from 12 to 17 years of age, although this group of participants represented only a small percentage of the overall sample (between 6% and 8%; see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Confirmation of these effects in paediatric populations is also required, especially because compliance with monthly injections of medication may prove more challenging in paediatric patients. <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 2001</LINK> reported a small number of withdrawals in children due to pain and fear of injection.</P>
<P>Future clinical studies should have more realistic clinical designs that could be more readily generalised to a routine asthma clinic and the licenced indication for omalizumab. One such observational 'real-life' study, EXCELS, is currently under way (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2012</LINK>) and may go some way toward reducing the strong Hawthorne effect that we have seen in the current analyses.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-15 20:22:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the whole, the quality of the included studies, with respect to our risk of bias assessment, was variable. Only seven studies (29%) were categorised as low in relation to risk of selection bias, whereas the risk of selection bias in the remaining 18 studies was viewed as unclear. Only four studies (17%) were evaluated as having low risk of performance and detection bias, and the remaining 21 studies were assessed as unclear. The risk of reporting bias was also viewed as a concern, as just three studies (13%) were assessed as having low risk of reporting bias, with the remaining 24 studies in the unclear category. However, 23 studies (96%) were viewed as having low risk of attrition bias, and only <LINK REF="STD-Lanier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK> were judged to be in the unclear category.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-12 16:14:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that we have identified a very significant proportion of the research addressing this clinical question through the use of a comprehensive systematic search, conducted by a highly experienced information specialist who has also provided considerable support in the identification of unpublished studies. At the same time, we acknowledge that there is a possibility of publication bias in this review, in that through failure to identify unpublished negative trials, the positive effects of omalizumab may be overestimated and, conversely, any failure to have identified unpublished positive trials may have reduced our estimate of the therapeutic benefit. However, these are concerns with most systematic reviews.</P>
<P>In addition, we acknowledge the possibility of study selection bias; however, all studies were independently evaluated by two review authors, and we are confident that studies excluded from the analyses were assessed on the basis of consistent and appropriate criteria.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-17 13:56:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have added 11 new clinical trials to the 14 reported in <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK>. Our emphasis has shifted to primarily the subcutaneous route of administration of omalizumab (18 studies in total) to maintain consistency between the focus of the review and current clinical treatment. The 11 new clinical trials added to the review all focus on subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo; therefore the conclusions pertaining to inhaled and intravenous omalizumab are unchanged, although our assessment of the quality, with respect to risk of bias, of the inhaled and intravenous omalizumab trials has been updated to reflect developments in Cochrane methodology. In broad terms, our conclusions related to subcutaneous omalizumab are similar to those of <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK>, although we have added to the update outcomes that consider mortality, hospitalisations and adverse events to sharpen the applicability of the review. The most consistent finding from <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK> that subcutaneous omalizumab reduces the likelihood of asthma exacerbations, when compared with placebo, is strengthened by this current update.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-12 16:15:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from the included trials have shown that omalizumab is both effective and safe in patients with moderate to severe asthma that is uncontrolled on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids with or without long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Insufficient evidence of benefit has been found in participants specifically with severe OCS-dependent asthma. Very few studies have explored efficacy in children with moderate to severe asthma. Although the drug does enable a modest reduction in the dose of inhaled steroids, it is not clear whether this outcome would justify the cost of this expensive treatment. Because omalizumab is an expensive treatment option, it will be important to determine which people would benefit most from its use. To justify treatment with anti-IgE, the amount of steroid that asthma sufferers are able to forego as a result of therapy would need to result in meaningful advantages in terms of lower risk derived from reduced exposure to steroids. The effect of the drug in participants with extreme values of serum IgE have not been evaluated. Finally, direct comparisons with other controller medications such as leukotriene antagonists or the novel anti-interleukin (IL)-5 therapies or biomarker-based (e.g. sputum eosinophil count) treatment strategies have not been evaluated. Thus, omalizumab remains one of the therapeutic options in patients with atopic asthma whose condition remains uncontrolled despite optimum therapy with high levels of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, and in those for whom this therapy can be afforded.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of eligible RCTs using the five-point scoring instrument proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>. This instrument evaluated the reported quality of randomisation, blinding and description of withdrawals and dropouts. Each study was scored according to the following criteria.</P>

<P>Inclusion criteria stated as: The study included participants 12 to 75 years of age with a history of severe allergic asthma for at least one year before screening. Participants received a diagnosis of asthma from physician investigators at each site on the basis of criteria specified by the NAEPP guidelines. Patients whose asthma was not well controlled despite treatment with high-dose ICS and LABAs with or without other controllers (including OCS) were enrolled. Asthma was considered not well controlled if participants had persistent asthma symptoms with current therapy, defined as an average of one or more night-time awakenings per week and daytime asthma symptoms requiring the use of rescue medication for two or more days per week during the four weeks before screening and for two consecutive weeks up to four weeks before randomisation. In addition, participants were required to have at least one documented asthma exacerbation during the previous 12 months, defined as increased asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroid rescue therapy. High-dose ICS was given at a minimum dose of 500 mcg of fluticasone dry powder inhaler twice daily or its similar ex-valve dose for at least eight weeks before screening. Long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment could consist of salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily or formoterol 12 mcg twice daily for at least eight weeks before screening.

<P>Conference abstract results and conclusions reported as: database/advertising screen of 870+ adult asthmatic patients yielded 85 participants (&lt; 10%) meeting initial criteria, 29 of whom completed screening, with eight (1%) qualifying for enrolment. All participants had negative primary puncture skin test sensitivity/RASTs to perennial allergens (dust mite/cat/ dog/cockroach); two demonstrated secondary reactivity to dust mites. Mechanistically, an expected rise in serum IgE (1.5-/6.4-fold) was observed in two or four subjects four months taking omalizumab. DC and basophils from these participants showed a &gt; 50% decrease in FceRIa. However, low serum IgE levels (&lt;two of eight IU) were not increased in the other two omalizumab participants, nor were changes in FceRIa expression discernible. Placebo participants (n = 53) showed no drop in FceRIa. Finally, no discernible changes were observed in basophil/DC function in any of the omalizumab-treated participants. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the difficulty in identifying a true subset of participants with the disease entity of NAA. Although expected shifts in cellular FceRIa expression were evident, we observed no evidence of clinical benefit (symptoms/lung function/med usage/QOL) in NAA participants treated with omalizumab</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Adverse events</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Aerosolised omalizumab</HEADING>
<P>More complaints of headache were seen among aerosolised omalizumab-treated participants compared with placebo participants (nine of 12 participants receiving low-dose omalizumab, eight of 10 participants receiving high-dose omalizumab and three of 11 placebo-treated participants). However, these differences did not achieve statistical significance. One participant developed IgG and IgA anti-omalizumab antibodies during the treatment phase of the trial. These antibodies were not detected at follow-up 11 weeks after completion of the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intravenous omalizumab (in participants not receiving ICS)</HEADING>
<P>Few adverse events were noted among participants with mild asthma who received intravenous omalizumab, and these events were not significantly different from side effects observed in placebo-treated participants.</P>
<P>In the intravenous study in moderate to severe participants, withdrawals were similar in the actively treated population (three of 106 (omalizumab) vs five of 105 (placebo); no reported P values, but obviously not significant) (<LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1999</LINK>).</P>
