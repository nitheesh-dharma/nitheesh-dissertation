<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-01 15:50:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Betamimetic tocolytics are drugs that reduce contractions and delay labour, which can improve placental blood flow and fetal oxygenation. They may be suggested to a woman during labour if the baby is showing signs of stress, such as an unusual heartbeat. Tocolysis may also be used to prevent fetal distress (prophylactically) during the second stage of labour, the time from when the cervix is fully dilated by the baby&#8217;s head to actual childbirth.</P>
<P>The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic intravenous betamimetic therapy with inactive or no treatment for women with uncomplicated pregnancies and whose babies were not showing signs of stress during the second stage of labour. They identified two trials involving 164 women, both conducted in the 1970s. One trial reported on clinical outcomes and found no beneficial differences in clinical neonatal outcome or Apgar scores at two minutes with tocolysis. The mean umbilical arterial pH values were slightly higher in the treatment groups of the two trials and intravenous betamimetics may prevent the deterioration of fetal arterial pH levels during the second stage of labour, possibly related to use of the supine position in these trials. Women receiving betamimetic drugs were more likely to have forceps delivery, which is the use of surgical tongs to assist the baby through the birth canal. Both trial protocols required forceps to be used if the second stage of labour, or time from initiation of the betamimetic infusion, exceeded 30 minutes. There were no clear differences in postpartum haemorrhage. The authors found inadequate evidence of benefit to recommend the prophylactic use of tocolytics in the second stage of labour.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-04-20 14:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-01 15:45:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic tocolysis with betamimetics and other agents has become widespread as a treatment for fetal distress. Uterine relaxation may improve placental blood flow and therefore, fetal oxygenation. However, there may also be adverse maternal cardiovascular effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of prophylactic betamimetic therapy during the second stage of labour on perinatal outcome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-04-20 14:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2011).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing prophylactic intravenous betamimetic therapy during the second stage of labour with placebo or no treatment in uncomplicated pregnancies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-14 10:29:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both authors assessed trial quality independently and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We compared continuous data using mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-06 15:45:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>One study involving 129 women and one including 35 women were included. Compared to placebo, prophylactic betamimetic therapy was associated with an increase in forceps deliveries in the first trial (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.29). Umbilical arterial pH values were higher in the tocolysis groups (two trials, 135 women; MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05). There were no clear effects on postpartum haemorrhage, Apgar scores at two minutes, neonatal irritability, or feeding slowness.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to support the prophylactic use of betamimetics during the second stage of labour. Future research should address the use of tocolysis for the management of fetal distress in the second stage of labour, avoiding the supine position.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

As the remaining groups appear similar in size and baseline characteristics (except for a greater variation in birthweight in the betamimetic group), the exclusions may not have materially biased the comparisons made, but this remains a possibility.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1975</LINK> do not describe the method of allocation concealment, but the study is double-blind, placebo-controlled. No clinical outcomes are given, other than noting that there were no cases of postpartum haemorrhage.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias was assessed as moderate for <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1978</LINK> (more than 20% loss to follow up); and moderate for <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1975</LINK> (poorly described methodology).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-05-01 15:55:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both trial protocols required forceps to be used if the second stage of labour or time from initiation of the infusion exceeded 30 minutes. In <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1978</LINK>, there were more forceps deliveries in the tocolytic group (100 women; risk ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 3.29), and no differences in clinical neonatal outcome or Apgar scores at two minutes. The mean umbilical arterial pH values were borderline significantly higher in the treatment group (two trials, 135 women; mean difference 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05). The occurrence of postpartum haemorrhage in two women in the study group can easily be ascribed to the play of chance.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The position of the women during the second stage of labour is not specified in <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1978</LINK>, and in <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1975</LINK> was supine. There is evidence that deteriorating fetal blood gas status during the second stage may occur in the supine position but be avoided by lateral tilting.</P>

<P>There is no evidence from this review of reduction of clinically important morbidity to support the routine use of intravenous tocolytics during the second stage of labour.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The findings in these studies that intravenous betamimetics may prevent the deterioration of fetal arterial pH levels during the second stage of labour, (possibly related to use of the supine position in these trials), may be relevant to the management of fetal distress during the second stage. Research into the use of intravenous betamimetics should be directed towards their use in the management of fetal distress, not uncomplicated pregnancies. Use of the supine position should be avoided in such research.</P>
