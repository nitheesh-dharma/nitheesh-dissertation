<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hyperthyroidism is a common illness in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood. Affected people, among other things suffer from increased heart beats, warm moist skin and raised body temperature. A large number of Chinese herbal medicines are used to treat this condition in China. Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were analysed. All of them were of low quality. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments. Some of these herbs may show benefits in improving symptoms, thyroid function and adverse effects. Unfortunately, we were unable to find reliable evidence to recommend a specific herbal preparation from 103 investigated formulations. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hyperthyroidism is a disease in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood. Patients, among other things suffer from tachycardia, warm moist skin and raised body temperature. The treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptom relief and therapy with antithyroid medications, radioiodine and thyroidectomy. Medicinal herbs are used alone or in combination with antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroidism in China and some other countries.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for treating hyperthyroidism.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, the Chinese Biomedical Database.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of Chinese herbal medicines alone with Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs, radioiodine or both.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three authors interviewed authors of all potentially relevant studies by telephone to verify randomisation procedures. One author entered data into a data extraction form and another author verified the results of this procedure. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were included. All of them were of low quality. Fifty-two studies still need to be assessed because the original authors could not be interviewed. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance. Compared to antithyroid drugs alone the results showed that Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs may offer benefits in lowering relapse rates, reducing the incidence of adverse effects, relieving symptoms, improving thyroid antibody status and thyroid function. Two trials investigated Chinese herbal medicine versus radioiodine and reported improvements in anxiety, tachycardia and heat intolerance. However, thyroid function - with the exception of restored thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) - was not significantly altered. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results suggest that traditional Chinese herbal medicines added to other routine treatment have a therapeutic potential for people with hyperthyroidism. However, due to methodological limitations, we could not identify a well-designed trial to provide strong evidence for Chinese traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Thus, we currently cannot recommend any single preparation or formulation for clinical use.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 12:51:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Both hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis describe a syndrome in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood because of an overactive thyroid gland or due to other causes leading to tachycardia, warm moist skin and raised body temperature.</P>
<P>The most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves's disease followed by non-cancerous growths of the thyroid or pituitary gland, tumours of the testes or ovaries, inflammation of the thyroid due to viral infections or other causes, ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone and ingestion of excessive amounts of iodine. Graves's disease accounts for 85% of all cases of hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hyperthyroidism is a common disorder: Unsuspected and undiagnosed hyperthyroidism was found in roughly 0.5% of women in a large population-based British survey, done in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>). Approximately 2% of women and 0.2% of men in the general population are affected by hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Farling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farling 2000</LINK>). Hyperthyroidism can occur at all ages, but is less common before the age of 15. At the other extreme, hyperthyroidism is one of the major causes of morbidity in the elderly. Graves's disease can occur at any age, whereas toxic multinodular goitre is more common in people older than 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-John-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical features of hyperthyroidism are all mainly caused by an excess of thyroid hormones. The most common manifestations include hyperkinesis, weight loss, sweating, palpitations and nervousness. Other manifestations include atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, tremor and weakness with general fatigue etc. However, not all the patients show these symptoms or signs but present with varying disorders like menstrual irregularities, vomiting or diarrhoea, psychotic illness, proximal myopathy or pruritus. A proportion of patients have negligible or no symptoms with the diagnosis discovered only during screening (<LINK REF="REF-John-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 1997</LINK>). Ophthalmic and cardiovascular complications are two clinically significant complications caused by hyperthyroidism. Thyroid-associated eye disease may occur before, after or contemporary with hyperthyroidism in different patients. It may result in diplopia, increased intraocular pressure, soft-tissue signs, marked congestive ophthalmopathy and even sight loss (<LINK REF="REF-John-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 1997</LINK>). Clinically evident ophthalmopathy occurs in about 50% of patients, however, imaging studies like ultrasonography and computed tomography reveal evidence of ophthalmopathy, in the form of enlarged extraocular muscles, in most patients without clinical signs (<LINK REF="REF-Weetmen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weetmen 2000</LINK>). The cardiovascular complications of hyperthyroidism are common and sometimes life-threatening. Most patients with hyperthyroidism complain of palpitations and breathlessness on exertion. A variety of atrial and ventricular tachycardias have been described in hyperthyroidism and the most common one is atrial fibrillation. Overt cardiac failure is rare in hyperthyroidism and usually occurs in the context of rapid atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with pre-existing ischaemic or vulvar heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Toft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toft 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The actual diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is easy to establish once its possibility is entertained. Accurate and widely available blood tests can confirm or rule out the diagnosis. In most patients, free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) and thyroxine (FT4) concentrations in serum are raised and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin might be undetectable. The 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake is a measure of the iodine avidity of the thyroid gland. In most hyperthyroid diseases, including Graves's disease, toxic multinodular goitre and toxic adenoma, the results are at the higher end of normal or raised. But this test is generally not needed to arrive at the diagnosis. However, it can be very useful in distinguishing mild Graves's disease from silent or postpartum thyroiditis in which the 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine will be low (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Description of treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptom relief and therapy with antithyroid medications, use of radioiodine (radioactive iodine 131 or I-131) and thyroidectomy. The extrathyroidal manifestations are not improved by treatment directed at hyperthyroidism and specific treatment is needed (<LINK REF="REF-McKenna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Medications for symptom relief</HEADING>
<P>Many of the neurological and cardiovascular symptoms such as tremor, palpitation and anxiety following thyrotoxicosis are relieved by beta-blocker therapy because these medicines can block the peripheral effects of the excess amounts of thyroid hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 1998</LINK>). Those with a longer duration of action such as propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and nadolol are usually preferred. Beta-antagonists are generally well tolerated, but can cause depression, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Furthermore, these drugs should be used cautiously in patients with asthma, congestive heart failure, or Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers can be used for the same purposes when beta-blockers are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Antithyroid medications</HEADING>
<P>Antithyroid drugs (thioamides: carbimazole, methimazole or propylthiouracil) are used for almost all patients with thyrotoxicosis in European countries. Carbimazole 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day or propylthiouracil 5 to 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses usually control hyperthyroidism in about 4 to 8 weeks. In practice, antithyroid drugs are usually given for 12 to 24 months when used alone. When the circulating thyroid hormone levels are restored to normal, treatment can be reduced to a single daily dose and titrated against regular thyroid function tests to maintain euthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-McKenna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 2001</LINK>). As with any long term treatment, patients' compliance is not good because many patients and their families find it remarkably difficult to remember to take the drugs regularly. Some 2% to 5% of patients will develop minor side effects with an antithyroid drug, such as rash, nausea, headache, or arthralgia. Usually, such symptoms are transient but if they persist the patient may take another major agent, as cross sensitivity is unusual. Serious adverse effects are rare, but include neutropenia, agranulocytosis (which is nearly always reversible) and hepatotoxicity, all of which need to be dealt with immediately once the effect is discovered (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Radioactive iodine</HEADING>
<P>Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment of hyperthyroidism in US adults. It is easy to administrate, lacks significant adverse effects and is relatively inexpensive. Those who relapse after a course of antithyroid drugs are usually prescribed radioactive iodine or undergo partial thyroidectomy. About 20% of patients will require a second dose of radioactive iodine. Around 50% become hypothyroidal within five years irrespective of the dose (<LINK REF="REF-McKenna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Thyroidectomy</HEADING>
<P>Surgery for hyperthyroidism is used infrequently all over the world (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1998</LINK>). Thyroidectomy is mainly used in specific situations including patient preference, poor response to antithyroid drugs (especially in pregnancy), presence of a very large goitre and the presence of a co-existing potentially malignant thyroid nodule (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>). The amount of thyroid tissue to be removed is not easy to decide on: A too conservative operation will result in a high rate of recurrent hyperthyroidism and an overly radical thyroidectomy in hypothyroidism. Either of these two problems could occur unpredictably many years later. Besides, a short hospital stay is needed and potential problems of the operation include the discomfort of the operation, the scar (which may form keloid), the risk of general anaesthesia and surgical complications like the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves and transient or permanent hypoparathyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>All currently available therapies are effective, but all the three options have problems as well. Antithyroid drugs usually do not cure the patient, need to be used for long time and have rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effects. Surgery is expensive, may cause permanent hypothyroidism and can be a source of significant morbidity from complications. Radioiodine necessitates radiation exposure, may almost inevitably cause hypothyroidism and may be associated with exacerbation of Graves ophthalmopathy in certain patient subsets (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Medicinal herbs</HEADING>
<P>Medicinal herbs are widely used to treat many diseases including hyperthyroidism in China and many other countries. Chinese herbs including membranous milk vetch root, begonia, tangshen, common anemarrhena rhizome, dwarf lilyturf tuber, Chinese magnoliavine fruitfigwort, rehmannia dride rhizome, common selfheal fruit-spike etc. have been used to treat hyperthyroidism. These herbs are able to decrease the raised affinity of alpha-adrenergic receptors in hyperthyroidism, weaken the biological effects of thyroxine and inhibit the transformation of T4 to T3 (<LINK REF="REF-Yao-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 1998</LINK>). Some are said to be able to modulate the function of sympathetic nerves or the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1998</LINK>). The contents of traditional Chinese herbal preparations are variable depending on traditional Chinese medicine syndromes of patients. They are used to treat hyperthyroidism along or in combination with other anti-hyperthyroidism drugs.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>Studies of Chinese herbal medicine for hyperthyroidism lack sufficient power to provide reliable estimates of the effects of treatment with herbal medicines, due to poor study design and low methodological quality of publications.</P>
<P>Certain important clinical criteria were not clearly defined in our included studies. Except for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2005</LINK>), which provided diagnostic criteria, most included studies did not mention or failed to provide sufficient details on diagnosis. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2003</LINK>) supplied exclusion criteria. </P>
<P>Furthermore, the included studies assessed different outcome measures and some endpoints were only mentioned in one or two publications. Often, the descriptions of the effects were ambiguous and qualitative, which made comparisons difficult. </P>
<P>Formulations of herbal medicines were prepared by the trial authors themselves or associates in ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2005</LINK>). The fact that in these ten studies, the trialists acted as the main players, including formulation designer, trial designer and performer, could have introduced bias</P>
<P>Although Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for hyperthyroidism and its method of manufacturing are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in trials cannot be clearly specified. In contrast, in pharmacological agents like antithyroid drugs, the chemical constituents, their quantities, the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known; and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of herbal treatments are an inevitable consequence of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), though the Chinese Government also specifies tolerable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to heterogeneity between the studies. One formulation of Chinese herbal medicine was tested by one study only.</P>
<P>Furthermore, one must accept that the overall treatment concept of TCM is different to that used in a pharmacological approach by means of antithyroid drugs. When a study uses a self-prepared herbal formulation, the quality of herbs and the methods of preparation should nevertheless be stated in detail, in order to achieve consistent effects.</P>
<P>A large number of the trials claimed to be RCTs, but when we phoned the trial authors and asked them about the method of randomisation they used, we found that in about 88% (93/106) of publications the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation. In addition, some of the studies were conducted several years ago and the trial authors may have forgotten the details of the methodology they employed, again increasing the probability of bias.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ding-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2003</LINK>) used unequal arms in their design. Of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2001b</LINK> applied a ratio of 3:1 and only 18 patients were included in the control group (66:18). In addition, calculation of sample sizes was not reported.</P>
<P>Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome caused by different causes. Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2002b</LINK> ) pointed out the exact causes. Therefore, it was difficult to associate the effects of herbal therapy with different causes of hyperthyroidism.</P>
<P>On the other hand, traditional Chinese herbal medicine should be used according to the "bian zheng lun zhi" rule. According to TCM theory, hyperthyroidism is recognised as nearly 40 types of "zheng". These different types of "zheng" need to be treated by different herbal medicine formulations. But no study reported in detail what type of "zheng" led to certain preparations making it difficult to judge whether the formulations used were appropriate or not.</P>
<P>Finally, half of studies (52/103) could not be evaluated because the original authors could not be interviewed with regards to the methodological issues. There is a potential risk of analysis bias regarding the results, although we think that only a few of these studies were real RCTs. We will try to contact the authors in the future and will update this review as soon as the interviews are completed.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>According to our findings, traditional Chinese herbal medicines in combination with other routine treatment may show some benefit for people with hyperthyroidism in improving their symptoms, signs, thyroid function and in avoiding or reducing some adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, drug rash caused by antithyroid drugs and hypothyroidism caused by treatment with radioiodine and thyroidectomy. </P>
<P>However, due to methodological limitations, we could not find a well-designed trial to provide strong evidence for Chinese traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Thus, we currently cannot recommend any single preparation or formulation for clinical use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High quality randomised controlled trials (RCT) are stilled needed for assessing the effects of Chinese herbal medicines combined with other routine treatment for hyperthyroidism. Especially, randomisation and allocation concealment should be done by independent individuals like a statistician. The authors should report the exact methods of randomisation and blinding (in particular who was blinded, for example outcomes assessors) as well as for allocation concealment to ensure quality and more rigorous reporting according to the CONSORT statement. The formulation for which "zheng" and the patients' "zheng" as well as details about the herbal medicines should be clearly specified and reported. <BR/>
