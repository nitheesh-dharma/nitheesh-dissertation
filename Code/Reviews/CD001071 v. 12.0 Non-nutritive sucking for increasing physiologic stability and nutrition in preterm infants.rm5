<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>Does non-nutritive sucking increase physiological stability and nutrition in preterm infants?</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>An infant born prematurely may be fed through a tube into the stomach and often receives a pacifier to suck on to improve nutrition. An infant needs coordinated sucking, swallowing and breathing to feed. The ability to suck and to swallow is present by 28 weeks gestation, but infants are not fully coordinated until 32 to 34 weeks. This means that preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation are usually not able to feed effectively from the breast or a bottle. They are fed by a small tube that is placed up the nose into the stomach (gavage feeding). Sucking on a pacifier (non-nutritive sucking) during gavage feeding may encourage the development of sucking behavior and improve digestion of the feeding. Non-nutritive sucking may also have a calming effect on infants, although it does have the potential to interfere with breastfeeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 12 eligible trials enrolling a total of 746 preterm infants in searches updated to February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>An overall analysis suggests that non-nutritive sucking reduces the time infants need to transition from tube to full oral feeding, and from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding. It also reduces the length of hospital stay. Non-nutritive sucking did not demonstrate a positive effect on weight gain.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Participants numbers in these studies were small, and we judged the quality of the evidence on outcomes assessed to be low or very low. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials are necessary for further evaluating the effectiveness and safety of non-nutritive sucking for increasing physiologic stability and nutrition in preterm infants.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:34:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 25 February 2016), Embase (1980 to 25 February 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 25 February 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-28 12:16:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials that compared non-nutritive sucking versus no provision of non-nutritive sucking in preterm infants. We excluded cross-over trials.</P>

<P>Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and undertook data extraction independently. We analysed the treatment effects in the individual trials and reported mean differences (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model in meta-analyses. We did not perform subgroup analyses because of the small number of studies related to the relevant outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-27 05:39:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 12 eligible trials enrolling a total of 746 preterm infants. Meta-analysis, though limited by data quality, demonstrated a significant effect of NNS on transition from gavage to full oral feeding (MD &#8722;5.51 days, 95% CI &#8722;8.20 to &#8722;2.82; N = 87), transition from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding (MD &#8722;2.15 days, 95% CI &#8722;3.12 to &#8722;1.17; N = 100), and the length of hospital stay (MD &#8722;4.59 days, 95% CI &#8722;8.07 to &#8722;1.11; N = 501). Meta-analysis revealed no significant effect of NNS on weight gain. One study found that the NNS group had a significantly shorter intestinal transit time during gavage feeding compared to the control group (MD &#8722;10.50 h, 95% CI &#8722;13.74 to &#8722;7.26; N = 30). Other individual studies demonstrated no clear positive effect of NNS on age of infant at full oral feeds, days from birth to full breastfeeding, rates and proportion of infants fully breastfeeding at discharge, episodes of bradycardia, or episodes of oxygen desaturation. None of the studies reported any negative outcomes. These trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding of intervention and outcome assessors and variability on outcome measures. The quality of the evidence on outcomes assessed according to GRADE was low to very low.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:35:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant effect of NNS on the transition from gavage to full oral feeding, transition from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding, and length of hospital stay. None of the trials reported any adverse effects. Well-designed, adequately powered studies using reliable methods of randomisation, concealment of treatment allocation and blinding of the intervention and outcome assessors are needed. In order to facilitate meta-analysis of these data, future research should involve outcome measures consistent with those used in previous studies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 19:20:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The early components of sucking have been demonstrated to occur in fetal life from about seven to eight weeks postconceptual age. Oral and gag reflexes appear at about 12 to 16 weeks and sucking at 15 to 18 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Breton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poore 2008</LINK>). At 28 weeks gestation, some infants may have established a suck-swallow-breathe cycle, although they lack the physiological stability to maintain this cycle whilst feeding, which can lead to variable oxygenation, irregular breathing sequence and poor digestion (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>). The smooth integration of sucking, swallowing and breathing during nutritive feeding allows the infant to feed efficiently and effectively. Full coordination may not occur until 32 to 34 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Amaizu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amaizu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neiva-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neiva 2007</LINK>).This means that preterm infants with less than 32 weeks gestation are usually not able to feed effectively from the breast or a bottle. They are fed by a small tube that is placed up the nose into the stomach (gavage feeding). In the gavage-fed infant, NNS is extremely important to facilitate a positive association between sucking and swallowing with satiation in order to avoid the development of feed aversion (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawdon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawdon 2000</LINK>). The effect of feeding experience contributes to the development of feeding skills (<LINK REF="REF-Amaizu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amaizu 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The development of both nutritive and non-nutritive sucking behaviours in preterm infants is thought to reflect neurobehavioral maturation and organization (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickler 2009</LINK>). An organized stable temporal pattern has been identified for both nutritive and non-nutritive sucking, enabling the features of each to be analysed by quantitative techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1992</LINK>). From a clinical perspective, the ability to feed depends on a coordinated sucking, swallowing, and breathing pattern. In preterm infants of less than 32 weeks gestation, this ability is not usually effective enough to sustain full oral feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1992</LINK>). In the interim, infants are fed by gavage tube until they are mature enough to take milk directly from the breast or bottle (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2001</LINK>). The development of oral feeding in infants requires complex anatomical and physiological coordination. The integration of structures involving the lips, cheeks, jaws, tongue, palate, pharynx, and larynx allow for the infant to create the appropriate pressure required for suction and swallowing during oral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>). Similarly, the ability to maintain stable physiologic functions such as heart rate, respiratory rate and function, and oxygen saturation are essential to prevent variable oxygenation, bradycardia, and irregular breathing sequence during feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Pickler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pickler 2004</LINK>). The coordination of the autonomic, motoric, and behavioral subsystems required to perform these actions may not be fully developed in the preterm infant, resulting in difficulty establishing a stable suck-swallow-breathe cycle prior to full-term gestation (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2004</LINK>).The inability of the premature infant to develop a stable suck-swallow-breathe cycle can be linked to factors such as poor motor skills and posture, multiple medical complications or an immature autonomic nervous system, which can then be further exacerbated by congenital abnormalities, low birth weight, or developmental complications (<LINK REF="REF-Boiron-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boiron 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodrill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodrill 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-27 06:47:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breastfeeding, bottle feeding and cup feeding are considered a form of nutritive sucking (NS) because the purpose of NS is to obtain nutrition in the form of breast milk or formula. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) occurs in the absence of nutrient flow and may be used to satisfy an infant's basic sucking urge or as a state regulatory mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1992</LINK>). Pacifiers play a significant role in non-nutritive sucking, one of which replaces the role of thumb sucking that has been shown to occur in the womb from as early as 12 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Jenik-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenik 2009</LINK>). A gloved finger and empty breast are also described as methods of non-nutritive sucking (<LINK REF="REF-Medeiros-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medeiros 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most often pacifiers have been used during gavage feeding to facilitate the co-ordination of sucking and swallowing.The development of the stable suck-swallow-breathe cycle present in full term infants is viewed as a sign of neurobehavioral stability and maturation. Hence achieving and maintaining this cycle for preterm infants is often fraught with difficulty, as neural and physiological pathways are often immature and uncoordinated (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2004</LINK>). Non-nutritive sucking has been shown to assist the infant in achieving and maintaining physiological homeostasis and behavioral state (<LINK REF="REF-Jenik-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenik 2009</LINK>). During nutritive sucking, if fluid is swallowed incorrectly it can lead to aspiration pneumonia, bradycardia, hypoxia, and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Crowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowe 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>). Non-nutritive sucking has the ability to create oral feeding experiences without the added stress of fluid. In addition, the act of NNS is one of an infant's first methods of self-organization and self-soothing, which is repetitive and rhythmic in nature. Non-nutritive sucking, particularly with a pacifier, is believed to have a calming effect on infants and is commonly used as an intervention in nurseries and neonatal intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-Kimble-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimble 1992b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-27 05:51:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for this intervention is that non-nutritive sucking facilitates the development of sucking behavior and improves digestion of enteral feeds. A number of enzymes/hormones have been implicated in the facilitation of digestion through non-nutritive sucking: lingual lipase, gastrin, insulin, and motilin. Experts believe that non-nutritive sucking stimulates the secretion of these enzymes/hormones through vagal innervation in the oral mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Chey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chey 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamosh-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamosh 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiener-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiener 1987</LINK>). NNS use has also been linked to improving the initiation and duration of the first nutritive suck, enhancing weight gain and reducing transition time between gavage and oral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Boiron-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boiron 2007</LINK>). Investigators have shown that NNS accelerates the acquisition of mature NNS patterns and improves feeding skills (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>An improved ability to modulate behavioral state is particularly important for the preterm infant at higher risk of developmental problems. Evidence suggests that providing non-nutritive sucking opportunities to premature infants during gavage feeding may have beneficial effects on oxygen saturation, gastrointestinal function, growth, and development (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1985</LINK>). Literature reporting the effectiveness of NNS as a pain relief strategy for infants is also increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Tsa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsa 2008</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:36:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our literature review found a meta-analysis of five studies of non-nutritive sucking in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1987</LINK>). The authors concluded that non-nutritive sucking reduced the time to first bottle feeding and reduced the days of hospitalisation. Outcome data related to weight gain were inconclusive.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the non-nutritive sucking research in preterm infants by <LINK REF="REF-Steer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1992</LINK> included eight randomised trials. The major outcome variables studied in these trials included weight gain, gastrointestinal transit, readiness for nipple feedings and length of hospitalisation. Lack of blinding to the intervention or outcome measurement in all studies affected the methodological quality of the findings. The authors concluded that in view of the limitations in the available research, there was insufficient beneficial evidence to support the use of non-nutritive sucking in the management of tube-fed preterm infants.</P>
<P>Non-nutritive sucking within newborn care settings has become common practice. Recent evidence further supports the notion that improving feeding skills through the use of NNS shortens the length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2008</LINK>). As a component of developmentally supportive care, NNS is widely promoted though neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and other newborn care centres. Although commonly considered a benign intervention, further synthesis of the literature is required to support the ongoing use of NNS.</P>

<P>Two review authors (JF and KP) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above.

<P>Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant effect favouring NNS on transition from gavage to full oral feeding (days), transition from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding (days), the length of hospital stay (days) and intestinal transit time. We found no significant effect for NNS on weight gain. One study found that NNS (during gavage feeding) significantly shortened intestinal transit time. Other individual studies demonstrated no clear positive effect of NNS on age of infant at full oral feeds, days from birth to full breastfeeding, rates and proportion of infants fully breastfeeding at discharge, episodes of bradycardia, and episodes of oxygen desaturation. The evidence for a positive effect on infant behavioral state is inconclusive, with two studies reporting that NNS had no effect on behavioral state and two studies reporting positive effects on sleep states. One study reported that NNS had no apparent effect on motilin, gastrin, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor-1.

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-30 00:45:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low according to the GRADE approach for all of the major outcomes. Moreover, few trials contributed to meta-analyses of the primary outcomes, and most of the trials that did not provide numerical data did not demonstrate any effect for NNS.</P>
<P>There were a number of limitations on the presently available evidence.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Design limitations</B>. Because of the nature of the intervention, blinding of the intervention only occurred in 1 of the 12 studies. Likewise, blinding of outcome assessors, although possible, was evident in only one of the studies reviewed.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcome variability</B>. Meta-analysis was limited in this review due to the large variation in outcomes and the limited number of randomised trials that were included in each outcome. Although many of the studies measured similar outcomes, the outcomes were too dissimilar to be included in a meta-analysis. Alternatively, the authors reported the significance level but did not provide specific data. In addition, the context of the measurement of the outcomes varied greatly among studies. For example, investigators measured outcomes before, during or after gavage feeding; before or after bottle feeding; separately from feeding; with variable timing; or they did not report the timing. Because of the small number of studies in each category that measured comparable outcomes, we combined all studies regardless of context. However, readers should consider these contextual differences when interpreting the results of the review.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Lack of long-term data</B>. The studies reviewed included no short- or long-term negative outcomes. The outcomes that trialists chose showed either a positive short-term effect or no effect as a result of NNS. None of included studies reported on long-term developmental outcomes in the infants.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Despite limiting the included studies to randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in this update of the systematic review, the certainty of the conclusions was not strengthened due to the methodological limitations of the included studies. Therefore, readers should interpret the study results with caution.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-30 09:36:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings from this review are consistent with the findings of three earlier systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Premji-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2000</LINK> synthesized eight randomized trials and concluded that NNS reduced length of hospitalisation but its effects on sucking response, gastric emptying and weight gain were inconclusive. <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1987</LINK> synthesized five studies of non-nutritive sucking in preterm infants in a meta-analysis. The authors concluded that non-nutritive sucking reduced the time to first bottle feeding and reduced the days of hospitalisation. Outcome data related to weight gain were inconclusive. A meta-analysis of the non-nutritive sucking research in preterm infants by Steer, Lucas and Sinclair (<LINK REF="REF-Steer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1992</LINK>) included eight randomised trials. The major outcome variables studied in these trials included weight gain, gastrointestinal transit, readiness for nipple feedings and length of hospitalisation. A lack of blinding to the intervention and/or outcome measurement in all studies affected the methodologic quality of the findings. The authors concluded that in view of the limitations in the available research, there was insufficient beneficial evidence to support the use of non-nutritive sucking in the management of tube-fed preterm infants.</P>

<P>Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant effect for NNS on transition from gavage to full oral feeding (days), transition from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding (days), the length of hospital stay (days), and intestinal transit time. We found no significant effect for NNS on weight gain. Single studies demonstrated no clear positive effect for NNS on age of infant at full oral feeds, episodes of bradycardia or episodes of oxygen desaturation. The evidence for positive effect on infant behavioral state was not consistent between trials.</P>
<P>Although a number of outcomes demonstrated no difference with or without NNS, there do not appear to be any short-term negative effects as a result of this intervention. Based on the available evidence, NNS in preterm infants would appear to have some clinical benefit. Although not specifically studied, NNS does not appear to have any negative short-term effect. No long-term data on the effects of NNS are presently available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:55:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-designed, adequately powered studies using reliable methods of randomisation, concealment of treatment allocation and blinding of the intervention and outcome assessors are needed. In order to facilitate meta-analysis of these data, future research should involve outcome measures consistent with those used in previous studies. In view of the fact that there are no long-term data, we recommend further investigation. In addition, published reports should include all relevant data including postnatal age of infants upon enrolment and age of infants when the outcomes are measured.</P>

<P>We reported several outcomes that were not predefined, including some new physiological outcomes.</P>
<P>We include only randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in this update. We have now excluded non-experimental designs and cross-over trials to increase the validity of the review. Most of the cross-over studies we found did not report whether there was a washout period, and as an intervention can have a lasting carry-over effect that compromises entry to subsequent periods of the trial, we excluded them from the review.</P>
<P>We added the methodology and plan for the 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE recommendations, which were not included in the original protocol or the previous versions of the review.</P>

<P>Anthropometric measures: weight, length, head and arm circumferences, skin folds (subscapular and triceps) obtained weekly.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal transit time: determined using carmine markers that were mixed with initial feeding on day 1 of the study and at weekly intervals. Transit time was determined upon the first appearance when the marker appeared in the stools for the first time. Other measures: description and frequency of stools and amount of aspirated gastric residue</P>
<P>Blood samples were obtained individually from each infant on day 1 of the study by venepuncture, and by heel stick weekly for serum protein determinations.</P>
<P>Energy expenditure: estimated where cumulative heart rate measurements were correlated with energy expenditure in premature infants. Infants were monitored for 4-6 consecutive hours during the 72 hour fecal collections.</P>
<P>Energy and fat excretions/energy expenditure: determined in a subgroup of 8 baby boys (4 control, 4 NNS). Measured at baseline, and 1 and 2 weeks post-treatment from 72 hour fecal collections. A second carmine marker was administered to infant boys 72 hours after the first marker so that stool collections exactly corresponded to 72 hours of formula intake.

<P>Infants were randomised to 4 groups (N = 112) </P>
<P>
<I>Experimental group 1</I>: NNS before gavage feeding</P>
<P>Infants were allowed to suck on pacifiers for 5 minutes, 7-8 times a day. The pacifier was placed in the infant's mouth whether or not they made an attempt to suck; however, where necessary the pacifier would be manipulated by the nurse to encourage sucking.</P>
<P>NNS and oral stimulation group: the combined group was administered by the oral motor program including oral stimulation for 12 minutes and NNS for 3 minutes, once a day</P>
<P>
<I>Experimental group 2</I>: oral stimulation group - consisted of stroking the cheeks, lips, gums, and tongues for 12 minutes</P>
<P>All interventions took place 30 minutes prior to feeding. All interventions started 48 hours after discontinuation of nasal continuous positive airway pressure and were continued until the newborn began exclusively oral diet</P>
<P>
<I>Experimental group 3:</I> NNS and oral stimulation - The combined group was administered by the oral motor program including oral stimulation for 12min and NNS for 3min, once a day. All infants in the three groups received the interventions 30 min before the beginning of scheduled feeding</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomized sequence.</P>
<P>
<I>Criteria for a judgement of 'low risk' bias</I>, for example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>referring to a random number table;</LI>
<LI>using a computer random number generator;</LI>
<LI>coin tossing;</LI>
<LI>shuffling cards or envelopes;</LI>
<LI>throwing dice;</LI>
<LI>drawing of lots;</LI>
<LI>minimisation (may be implemented without a random element and this is considered to be equivalent to being random).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Criteria for the judgement of </I>'<I>high risk</I>'<I> bias</I>:<I> t</I>he investigators described a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generated by odd or even date of birth;</LI>
<LI>sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission;</LI>
<LI>sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other non-random approaches happen much less frequently than the systematic approaches mentioned above and tend to be obvious. They usually involve judgement or some method of non-random categorization of participants, for example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>allocation by judgement of the clinician;</LI>
<LI>allocation by preference of the participant;</LI>
<LI>allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests;</LI>
<LI>allocation by availability of the intervention.</LI>
