<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-21 14:29:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is uncomplicated malaria and how might artesunate-pyronaridine work</B>
</P>
<P>Uncomplicated malaria is the milder form of malaria which usually causes fever, with or without headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can rapidly develop into severe malaria with kidney failure, fitting, unconsciousness, and eventually death. <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> is the most common parasite causing malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and causes most of the severe malaria worldwide.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization currently recommends countries use one of five different artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat malaria. These combinations contain an artemisinin component (artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or artesunate), which works quickly to clear the parasite from the person's blood, and a longer-acting drug which clears the remaining parasites from the blood and may prevent new <I>Plasmodium</I> infections for several weeks. Artesunate plus pyronaridine is a new combination and in this review we evaluate its effectiveness and safety compared to the other ACTs.</P>
<P>After examining the research published up to 16 January 2014, we included six randomized controlled trials, enrolling 3718 children and adults.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says </B>
</P>
<P>Based on studies of mostly older children and adults living in Africa and Southeast Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artemether-lumefantrine at treating uncomplicated malaria and preventing further malaria infections after treatment (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In a study primarily of older children and adults in Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria and preventing recurrent parasitaemias (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were rare in people treated with either artesunate-pyronaridine or other ACTs. However, short-lasting liver toxicity was more frequent in people treated with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Artesunate-pyronaridine performed well compared to the other two ACT with which it has been compared, but further studies in African and Asian children are required to help clarify whether this combination is an option for first-line treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-28 14:31:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people with uncomplicated <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria are treated using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT). ACT combines three-days of a short-acting artemisinin derivative with a longer-acting antimalarial which has a different mode of action. Pyronaridine has been reported as an effective antimalarial over two decades of use in parts of Asia, and is currently being evaluated as a partner drug for artesunate.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-21 15:34:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomized controlled trials enrolling 3718 children and adults.</P>
<P>
<I>Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artemether-lumefantrine</I>
</P>
<P>In two multicentre trials, enrolling mainly older children and adults from west and south-central Africa, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artemether-lumefantrine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 42 days of follow-up, with no differences between groups (two trials, 1472 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There were fewer new infections during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90, two trials, 1720 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), but no difference was detected over the whole 42 day follow-up (two trials, 1691 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artesunate plus mefloquine</I>
</P>
<P>In one multicentre trial, enrolling mainly older children and adults from South East Asia, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artesunate plus mefloquine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 28 days follow-up (one trial, 1187 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). PCR-adjusted treatment failures were 6% by day 42 for these treated with artesunate-pyronaridine, and 4% for those with artesunate-mefloquine (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.00, one trial, 1116 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Again, there were fewer new infections during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73, one trial, 1720 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), but no differences were detected over the whole 42 days (one trial, 1146 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>

<I>Adverse effects</I>
</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were uncommon in these trials, with no difference detected between artesunate-pyronaridine and comparator ACTs. The analysis of liver function tests showed biochemical elevation were four times more frequent with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (RR 4.17, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.62, four trials, 3523 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-04 13:46:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria continues to pose a serious global health challenge despite considerable progress over the past decade to control and eliminate malaria in some parts of the world. In 2010, there were an estimated 219 million malaria illness episodes, resulting in around 660,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five species of <I>Plasmodium</I> parasite cause malaria in humans; <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> and <I>P. vivax</I> are the most common, and <I>P. falciparum</I> causes most of the severe disease cases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Uncomplicated malaria is the mild form of the disease, typically characterized by fever with or without associated headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, rigors, nausea, and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can rapidly develop into severe, life-threatening forms of the disease, particularly in people that have not acquired immunity. Effective immunity generally requires repeated infections over five to 10 years, and is reduced during pregnancy. Consequently in highly endemic settings, as seen in many areas of rural sub-Saharan Africa, young children and pregnant women are most at risk, while in settings with low or seasonal transmission, all age groups can be equally at risk (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many parts of the world, <I>P. falciparum</I> has developed resistance to most antimalarial drugs used as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-White-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends that <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria is always treated with a combination of two drugs that act at different biochemical sites within the parasite (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). If a parasite mutation producing drug resistance arises spontaneously during treatment, the parasite should then be killed by the partner drug, thus reducing or delaying the development of resistance and increasing the useful lifetime of the individual drugs (<LINK REF="REF-White-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now recommended for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria; artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ), artesunate plus mefloquine (AS+MQ), artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). The artemisinin components (artemether, artesunate, or dihydroartemisinin) are highly effective schizonticides, and over three days of treatment rapidly eliminate up to 90% of the blood stage asexual forms of <I>P. falciparum</I>. The partner drugs are longer-acting and are used to clear any residual infection (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurtzhals-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzhals 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). The combinations with very long half-lives (AS+MQ and DHA-P) can provide a period of post-treatment prophylaxis which may last for up to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resistance to the artemisinin-derivatives was first reported among <I>P. falciparum </I>strains in 2008 along the Thai-Cambodian border (<LINK REF="REF-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dondorp 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). This has led to global initiatives to contain the spread of artemisinin resistance, which includes the development of new drugs to partner and protect the artemisinin-derivatives in ACT (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-12 17:22:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pyronaridine is a benzonaphthyridine derivative first synthesized in China in 1970 (<LINK REF="REF-Fu-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 1991</LINK>). It was used extensively as a monotherapy to treat <I>P. falciparum</I> and <I>P. vivax</I> infections in the Hunan and Yunan provinces of China for more than 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1992</LINK>), and to treat <I>P. falciparum</I> in some parts of Africa during the 1980s. Between 1985 and 1995, some in vitro pyronaridine-resistant strains of <I>P. falciparum</I> emerged along the China-Lao and China-Myanmar border areas (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Elsewhere, in vitro studies using clinical isolates of <I>P. falciparum </I>from<I> </I>Africa, Cambodia, and Thailand in the 1990s demonstrated high activity of pyronaridine against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant <I>P. falciparum</I> strains (<LINK REF="REF-Childs-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Childs 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Basco-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basco 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pradines-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pradines 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringwald-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringwald 1999</LINK>), and more recent in vitro studies have also shown pyronaridine to be effective against multiple-drug resistant <I>P. falciparum</I> schizonts and gametocytes in Thailand and Indonesia (<LINK REF="REF-Chavalitshewinkoon_x002d_Petmitr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavalitshewinkoon-Petmitr 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Price-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2010</LINK>), and against chloroquine-resistant <I>P. falciparum</I> strains in Gabon (<LINK REF="REF-Kurth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurth 2009</LINK>). However, almost half of 28 <I>P. falciparum</I> isolates tested in vitro in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, were resistant to pyronaridine and also showed some evidence of cross resistance to dihydroartemisinin (<LINK REF="REF-Brice-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brice 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pyronaridine interferes with the glutathione-dependent detoxification of haem and targeting of &#946;-haematin formation (<LINK REF="REF-Auparakittanon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auparakittanon 2006</LINK>). Its activity in multi-drug resistant strains of <I>P. falciparum </I>is believed to be due to its ability to<I> </I>inhibit P-glycoprotein function and reverse multi-drug resistance in cell lines (<LINK REF="REF-Qi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pradines-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pradines 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pyronaridine is structurally related to amodiaquine, leading to some concerns that pyronaridine may have similar toxicity related to the formation of a reactive metabolite (quinoneimine) in the liver and white blood cells. However, some studies suggest that pyronaridine and other bis-Mannich compounds are structurally advantaged and do not form the bioactive quinoneimine metabolite (<LINK REF="REF-Naisbitt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naisbitt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruscoe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruscoe 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of antimalarial drug efficacy</HEADING>
<P>The WHO recommends that new antimalarials should have a treatment failure rate of less than 5%, and that failure rates greater than 10% with existing first-line antimalarials should trigger a change in treatment policy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment failure can be classified as:</P>
<P>Early treatment failure:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the development of danger signs or severe malaria on days 1, 2, or 3 in the presence of parasitaemia;</LI>
<LI>parasitaemia on day 2 higher than on day 0;</LI>
<LI>parasitaemia and axillary temperature &gt; 37.5 캜 on day 3;</LI>
<LI>parasitaemia on day 3 &gt; 20% of count on day 0.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Late treatment failure:</P>
<UL>
<LI>development of danger signs, or severe malaria, after day 3 with parasitaemia;</LI>
<LI>presence of <I>P. falciparum</I> parasitaemia and axillary temperature &gt; 37.5 캜 on or after day 4;</LI>
<LI>presence of <I>P. falciparum</I> parasitaemia after day 7.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The late reappearance of <I>P. falciparum</I> parasites in the blood of an infected person can be due to failure of the drug to completely clear the original parasite (a recrudescence) or due to a new infection, which is especially common in areas of high transmission. A molecular genotyping technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used in clinical trials to distinguish between recrudescence and new infection, giving a clearer picture of the efficacy of the drug and its post-treatment prophylactic effect (<LINK REF="REF-White-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cattamanchi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattamanchi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The WHO recommends a minimum follow-up period of 28 days for antimalarial efficacy trials, but longer periods of follow-up may be required for antimalarials with long elimination half-lives (<LINK REF="REF-White-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bloland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 2003</LINK>). Treatment failure due to true recrudescence of malaria parasites may be delayed until the drug concentration falls below the minimum concentration required to inhibit parasite multiplication, which may be beyond 28 days. The WHO recommends 42 days follow-up for trials involving lumefantrine and piperaquine and 63 days follow-up for trials of mefloquine (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>Our primary analysis drew on the WHO's protocol for assessing and monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Bloland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 2003</LINK>). This protocol has been used to guide most efficacy trials since its publication in 2003, even though it was designed to assess the level of antimalarial resistance in the trial area rather than for comparative trials. As a consequence, a high number of randomized participants are excluded from the final efficacy outcome as losses to follow-up or voluntary or involuntary withdrawals (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">PCR-adjusted total failure</HEADING>
<P>We determined PCR-adjusted total failure (<I>P. falciparum</I>) as the sum of early treatment failures, and late treatment failures due to PCR-confirmed recrudescence. We treated participants with indeterminate PCR results, missing PCR results, or PCR-confirmed new infections as involuntary withdrawals and excluded them from the calculation. The denominator excludes participants for whom an outcome was not available (for example, those who were lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, took other antimalarials, or failed to complete treatment) and participants who did not fulfil the inclusion criteria after randomization.</P>
<P>These primary outcomes relate solely to failure due to <I>P. falciparum</I>.

We recorded these assessments in the standard 'risk of bias' tables and summarized the risk of bias for each trial in a summary risk of bias graph.</P>

<P>Arithmetic means and standard deviations used to summarize continuous data are assumed to be normally distributed; however, sometimes these summary statistics are incorrectly used when the data are not normally distributed. Therefore, when arithmetic means were reported, we checked the normality of the data by calculating the ratio of the mean over the standard deviation. If this ratio (mean/standard) was &lt; 2, then it is likely that the data are skewed as the mean cannot then lie in the centre of a normal distribution. It is possible to combine data with less severe degrees of skew in meta-analyses and when ratio of the mean over the standard deviation was more than one (ratios less than one indicate that data were severely skewed), we combined data from these trials with normally distributed data.</P>

<I>Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artemether-lumefantrine</I>
</P>
<P>In two multicentre trials, enrolling mainly older children and adults from west and south-central Africa, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artemether-lumefantrine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 42 days of follow-up, with no differences between groups (<I>low quality evidence</I>). There were fewer new infections during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), but no difference was detected over the whole 42 day follow-up (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>

<P>In one multicentre trial, enrolling mainly older children and adults from South East Asia, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artesunate plus mefloquine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 28 days follow-up (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). PCR-adjusted treatment failures had risen to 6% by day 42 in those treated with artesunate-pyronaridine, but this was not substantially different to artesunate plus mefloquine (<I>low quality evidence</I>).

<I>Adverse effects</I>
</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were rare in these trials with no statistically significant differences between artesunate-pyronaridine and the comparator ACTs. However, biochemical elevation of LFTs occurred four times more frequently with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-11 14:54:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Artesunate-pyronaridine performed well in all three efficacy trials included in this review, with low levels of PCR-adjusted treatment failure at day 28 in all settings. All three trials were multicentre trials, with trial sites in 11 African countries and six countries in Asia, which broadens the applicability of the findings. However, the actual number of participants recruited from many trial sites was small and the trials were underpowered to evaluate either superiority or equivalence at country level. East Africa is particularly under represented, with only 232 participants from Kenya and Tanzania, and several of the West African countries recruited fewer than 100 participants.</P>
<P>The other major limitation on the applicability of these trials is the age of the participants. The trials predominantly recruited older children and adults. The combination appeared to be effective in these groups but little is known about the main target group; children aged under five years. These trials included only 232 children aged below five years compared to over 7000 in trials of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.</P>
<P>Notably, all three efficacy trials excluded people with known pre-existing liver disease, and one trial explicitly excluded those with raised LFTs at baseline. Screening of this kind may not be feasible in many malaria-endemic settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-12 17:24:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence in this review using the GRADE approach and presented it in two summary of findings tables for efficacy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that artesunate-pyronaridine is equivalent to established ACTs at preventing PCR-adjusted treatment failures was of moderate quality due to two main concerns:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Indirectness: The trials to date have largely been conducted in older children and adults, with exclusion of young children who bear the greatest burden and risks of malaria infection and illness.</LI>
<LI>Imprecision: The trials were not powered to examine the efficacy of artesunate-pyronaridine in individual regions or countries. This is problematic for national decision-making, and limits the wider generalizability of these results. Larger trials would be required to have full confidence in these results.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We also assessed the quality of evidence on comparative adverse effects and presented these in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. In general the evidence was of moderate to low quality, and downgraded for similar reasons.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-28 14:41:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of the review changed significantly between the published protocol and final review. The basis for the change was to focus on only interventions of relevance to current malaria treatment policies (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). We used standard methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and complied with the Cochrane Collaboration's methodological standards for the conduct of new reviews of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-MECIR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MECIR 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We believe that we have identified all pyronaridine trials relevant to inform clinical decisions and policy regarding the use of pyronaridine combinations for the treatment of uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria. The three trials were all conducted under the auspices of the public-private partnership, Medicines for Malaria Venture, and Poong Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-02-21 15:36:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found one further systematic review of artesunate-pyronaridine published by authors from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the co-developers of the artesunate-pyronaridine combination (<LINK REF="REF-Duparc-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duparc 2013</LINK>). The authors include four of the studies included here, plus one study we excluded as it was not randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Ramharter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ramharter 2008</LINK>), and one unpublished study. The authors conclude that 'Pyronaridine-artesunate was well tolerated with no safety concerns with the exception of mostly mild transient rises in transaminases. Efficacy was high and met the requirements for use as first-line therapy'. While we agree that artesunate-pyronaridine shows promise as a further addition to the ACT combinations, we think it requires further studies in the main target group, children aged less than five years, before countries consider this as a first-line treatment.</P>

<P>Artesunate-pyronaridine is well-tolerated, apart from transient gastrointestinal adverse effects, similar to other antimalarials. However, the potential for liver toxicity in people treated with artesunate-pyronaridine needs further investigation and will necessitate caution in using this treatment combination, particularly in people with pre-existing liver disorders.</P>

<P>We stated in the protocol that we intended to assess the methods used to generate the allocation sequence and conceal allocation concealment as adequate, inadequate, or unclear according to <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jni 2001</LINK>, and note who was blinded to the interventions in each trial. However, since the introduction of <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>, we made these assessments using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>In keeping with the Cochrane Collaboration policy to use 'Summary of findings' tables, which was introduced after publication of the protocol, we generated them using GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>) and interpreted the evidence for each outcome and comparison using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnemann 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We revised the list of outcomes to reflect current WHO standards for assessing outcomes in antimalarial trials.</P>
<P>Although gametocyte carriage was not included as an outcome in the protocol, we included it as a secondary outcome due to its importance in malaria transmission.</P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that we intended to assess the effectiveness of pyronaridine both as a monotherapy and in combination with an artemisinin. However, we revised this to focus only on pyronaridine-artemisinin combinations. In addition, due to concerns regarding pyronaridine's effect on the liver, assessment of the effects of the comparisons on liver function now include randomized comparisons in both falciparum and vivax malaria. Accordingly, we updated the background and methods sections considerably to reflect the changing scenario in malaria policies and epidemiology.</P>
<P>PT and HB joined the review team. Rajeev Aravindakshan withdrew from the team due to conflicting demands on his time.</P>
