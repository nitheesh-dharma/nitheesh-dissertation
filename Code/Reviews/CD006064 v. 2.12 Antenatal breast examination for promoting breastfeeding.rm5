<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-29 09:07:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Breast examination during pregnancy may be performed by a healthcare provider or by the pregnant woman herself. The rationale for antenatal breast examination has included the need to determine whether any problems with breastfeeding could be anticipated, using the time during examination as an opportunity for the healthcare provider to introduce and discuss the importance of breastfeeding, and for the detection of breast cancer during pregnancy. Despite these purported benefits of antenatal breast examination, whether there is evidence that it should be recommended for all pregnant women remains unclear.</P>
<P>Antenatal breast examination to determine whether any problems with breastfeeding could be anticipated typically included identification of the presence of flat or inverted nipples so that breast shells or nipple exercises (for example, Hoffman's exercises) could be prescribed to remedy the situation. Randomised controlled trials, however, have found that these interventions did not affect whether or not a woman was able to breastfeed successfully (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAIN-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAIN 1994</LINK>). Moreover, it was reported that 13% of the women approached during one of the trials who were intending to breastfeed decided not to breastfeed after being told that they had a potential problem (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1992</LINK>). Therefore, antenatal breast examination for the purpose of treating flat or inverted nipples to prepare women for breastfeeding was not only found to be ineffective, but it may also act as a deterrent to breastfeeding. A Cochrane protocol assessing the effectiveness of nipple care on the duration of breastfeeding has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Blyth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blyth 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, in developed countries in particular, it has been hypothesised that as more women postpone childbirth until later in life, breast cancer in pregnancy will become an increasing concern (
<LINK REF="REF-Woo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 2003</LINK>). Thus, antenatal breast examination has been recommended as a screening method for breast cancer during pregnancy. In countries where national breast screening programmes are in place, however, it is only routinely offered to women aged 50 and older and usually through mammography rather than breast examination. Furthermore, no evidence has been found to support breast examination by a doctor, nurse or the women themselves as a primary screening technique for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite this lack of evidence, breast self examination (BSE) is encouraged, and examination by a healthcare provider in the antenatal period continues to be recommended in some countries, such as the USA and Canada (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SOGC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOGC 2002</LINK>). While potential harms from BSE are less obvious, many women may find a clinical breast examination during pregnancy intrusive. In addition, breasts are often tender and swollen during pregnancy making examination difficult and potentially compounding a woman's feelings of uncomfortableness or vulnerability when the examination is conducted by a healthcare provider.</P>
<P>Although it is unclear how common the practice of antenatal breast examination is globally, it is clear that some countries continue to recommend antenatal breast examination. The aim of this review is to examine the effect of antenatal breast examination(s) on the promotion of breastfeeding.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-29 12:19:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>We located no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effects of antenatal breast examination.</P>
<P>There is potential for both harm and benefit from antenatal breast examinations. While antenatal breast examination may be used as an opportunity to discuss the importance of breastfeeding, many women may find a clinical breast exam during pregnancy intrusive. Although it is recommended as routine clinical practice in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SOGC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOGC 2002</LINK>), we found no studies to demonstrate that it is effective in promoting breastfeeding.</P>
<P>An RCT that compared mothers who received a 30-minute counselling session on breastfeeding technique with mothers who did not receive any counselling found no difference in the frequency of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 30 days after birth (<LINK REF="REF-de-Oliveira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Oliveira 2006</LINK>), suggesting that it is unlikely that discussion during a single antenatal breast examination would effect initiation of breastfeeding. Even if discussion raised during an antenatal breast examination were effective in initiating breastfeeding, there is no conceivable reason that the same discussion could not be raised without having to perform a breast examination. Indeed, it has been shown that postnatal interventions involving support by maternity ward staff and clinicians can increase the number of women who are exclusively breastfeeding at four weeks after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Labarere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labarere 2005</LINK>). Another study on the use of breast shells and Hoffman's exercises reported that 13% of women who were intending to breastfeed decided not to after being told they had a potential problem (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1992</LINK>) indicating that antenatal breast exam could, in fact, deter women from initiating breastfeeding.</P>
<P>The argument that breast cancer in pregnancy will become an increasing concern as more women, in developed countries in particular, postpone childbirth until later in life (<LINK REF="REF-Woo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 2003</LINK>) is another potential justification for routine antenatal breast examination. During pregnancy, however, the breasts often become tender and swollen (<LINK REF="REF-Kitzinger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitzinger 2003</LINK>), which can make the examination uncomfortable for the mother and diagnosis difficult for the clinician (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>). Rather than routine breast examination, it may be enough to encourage women to report any changes that they notice in their breasts to their GP or carer. But no evidence has been found to support breast examination by a doctor, nurse or the women themselves as a primary screening technique for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ideally, policies that govern the care of pregnant women should be evidence based. There is no doubt that breastfeeding is beneficial for both mother and infant. However, there is no evidence to support the notion that antenatal breast examinations are effective in promoting breastfeeding, nor any evidence on other potential effects of antenatal breast examination, such as the detection of breast anomalies or satisfaction with care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-04-29 09:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is a need to evaluate the potential harms and benefits of antenatal breast examination. In particular, countries that recommend routine antenatal breast examination should conduct appropriate studies to justify a procedure that some women may find intrusive. Studies should include an assessment of other effects of antenatal breast examination, such as satisfaction with care and success of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>The effectiveness (or lack thereof) of antenatal breast examination on the initiation of breastfeeding needs to be assessed using randomised controlled trials that compare women who do and do not receive breast examinations. Studies may or may not include other interventions to promote breastfeeding. Consideration should also be given to trials which assess the effectiveness of antenatal breast examination for the detection of breast cancer, investigating whether antenatal breast examination impacts disease outcome.</P>

<P>Using the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration to determine trials for inclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>), we will independently assess the titles and abstracts of all studies identified to determine whether each article might meet the predetermined eligibility criteria, such as: includes pregnant women who have attended antenatal care and assesses one or more of the outcomes to be measured. In the presence of doubt about article inclusion, the decision will be taken at the next stage at which the full text of the article will be obtained to clarify doubts about eligibility criteria. If required, we will request further information or data from trial authors. We will resolve discrepancies in selecting studies by discussion. Excluded studies will be detailed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>We will extract information regarding the methodological quality on a number of levels. Assessment of selection bias will examine the process involved in the generation of random sequence and the method of allocation concealment. We will judge these as adequate or inadequate using the following criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodology</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Adequate: assignment to groups was determined by central off-site randomisation, sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or other appropriate schemes that could not be influenced by the investigators and where the person who generated the allocation scheme did not administer it.<DEL MODIFIED="2008-04-28 20:45:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BR/>
</DEL>Unclear: 'random' or 'concealed' stated without further explanation.<BR/>Inadequate: alternation, the use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week, coin toss and any procedure for which allocations could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For completeness of follow up</HEADING>
<P>(A) Adequate: less than 20% of participants withdrawn or lost to follow up;<BR/>(B) unclear;<BR/>(C) inadequate: 20% or more of participants withdrawn or lost to follow up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>(A) Adequate: the investigator who assesses the results did not know the allocated treatment;<BR/>(B) unclear;</P>
<P>(C) not possible to blind: for self-reported outcomes such as maternal anxiety and satisfaction with care;<BR/>(D) no blinding: the investigator knew the allocated treatment.</P>
<P>Double blinding is impossible in these kinds of trials, as the participants know which intervention they receive. Blinding of those assessing the results (single blinding) will however be highlighted and considered in a separate sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will extract data independently and compare them. We will conduct data management and analysis using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We will resolve differences in data extraction by consensus, referring back to the original article.</P>
<P>For individual trials, we will report mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables. We will report relative risks and risk differences (with 95% confidence intervals) for categorical variables. For the meta-analysis, we will calculate mean differences (with 95% continuous intervals) for continuous variables and relative risks and risk differences (with 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated for categorical variables, where possible. If the information is provided by the study, we will use an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>We will initially analyse all data with a fixed-effect model. We will apply the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to describe the proportion of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We will consider an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of more than 50% as substantial heterogeneity. If heterogeneity is detected, we will perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Heterogeneity that is not explained by subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be modelled using a random-effects analysis, which assumes that the effect size varies across studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>To assess whether the effect of the intervention works differently in particular groups of subjects and if the amount of data permits, we will conduct subgroup analyses according to the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>women who have previously breastfed versus women who have not;</LI>
<LI>primiparous women versus parous women.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We will use sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of results with regards to allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, losses to follow up and other study characteristics. We will perform these analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size:</P>
<OL>
<LI>repeating the analysis, taking account of study quality, as previously specified in quality assessment section. We will compare the results of high-quality studies with those of poorer-quality studies, where studies rated A for all quality criteria will be compared with those rated B or C;</LI>
<LI>repeating the analysis excluding any very large or long-term trials to establish how much they dominate the result.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We will use funnel plots and a simple graphical test to assess for evidence of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
