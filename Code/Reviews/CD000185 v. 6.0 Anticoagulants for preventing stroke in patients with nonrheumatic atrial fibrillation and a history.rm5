<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-16 13:56:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Anticoagulants are beneficial and safe for preventing a second stroke in people with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and recent cerebral ischaemia. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a heart rhythm disorder commonly found in patients who have had a stroke. Patients with NRAF have an irregular heart beat and this can cause the formation of a blood clot in the left atrium of the heart . This clot may break away and block a cerebral artery causing a stroke. Patients who have had a stroke in the presence of NRAF have a high risk of another stroke. Anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, make the blood 'thinner' and prevent the formation of blood clots and hence could prevent stroke. However, anticoagulant drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain and this complication could offset any benefits. This review identified two trials in which patients with NRAF who had a stroke were treated with anticoagulant therapy. These studies show that anticoagulants safely reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by two-thirds, despite a higher chance of major extracranial bleeds. There was no increased risk of intracranial bleeds. <BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-16 13:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a common dysrhythmia, and its prevalence increases rapidly with age (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1991</LINK>). It affects 2% to 5% of the general population over the age of 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 1980</LINK>) and it can be found in about 15% of all stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1983</LINK>) and in about 2% to 17% of patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (<LINK REF="REF-Bogousslavsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogousslavsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koudstaal-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koudstaal 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whisnant-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whisnant 1999</LINK>). NRAF more than quadruples the risk of stroke as compared to patients in sinus rhythm (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1991</LINK>) and the incidence of ischaemic stroke, ranges between 0.5% to 5% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flegel-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flegel 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopecky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopecky 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1983</LINK>). Following an initial stroke, the stroke recurrence rate varies in different studies between 2% and 15% in the first year following stroke, and is 5% yearly thereafter, with a mortality rate of 5% yearly (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1986</LINK>). The risk of recurrence is dependent on the type of cardiac abnormality (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>) and also on the presence of a previous history of TIA or ischaemic stroke, hypertension, diabetes, age greater than 75 years, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with combined rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and atrial fibrillation show the highest recurrence rate. The incidence of RHD, however, has declined in Western societies and the most common cardioembolic source is NRAF (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until the end of the 1980s, the management of patients with NRAF was based entirely on evidence from uncontrolled, non-randomised studies. Around 1990, five large clinical trials investigated the value of anticoagulation in the primary prevention of stroke and other vascular events in patients with NRAF (<LINK REF="REF-AFASAK-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFASAK 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BAATAF-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAATAF 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAFA-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAFA 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SPAF-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>). A systematic review of these five randomised trials concluded that warfarin consistently decreased the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (a 68% reduction in risk) with virtually no increase in the frequency of major bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>For neurologists, secondary prevention is of greater relevance to their everyday clinical practice than primary prevention, since NRAF patients with a recent TIA or minor stroke are more likely to be referred to them. In the absence of direct data supporting the value of anticoagulants or aspirin in secondary prevention, many physicians probably extrapolated the results of the primary prevention trials. However, this was not without risk. Firstly, NRAF patients who have suffered a recent stroke are generally older and are likely to have more advanced atherosclerosis of extra- and intracranial blood vessels. This may lead to a much higher risk of intracerebral bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2001</LINK>). Secondly, in at least a third of NRAF patients with recent cerebral ischaemia, the stroke is related to an arterial lesion rather than to embolism from the heart (<LINK REF="REF-CETF-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CETF 1986</LINK>) and aspirin may be the most effective drug in such patients.</P>
<P>The subject of this Cochrane review is the value of anticoagulant treatment in the prevention of recurrent vascular events in NRAF patients with a recent TIA or minor ischaemic stroke (secondary prevention). So far only two RCTs have addressed this issue (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>). In the VA-SPINAF, which was a primary prevention study, a small proportion of patients had suffered a previous stroke or TIA and the results for these patients were reported separately. The EAFT was a secondary prevention trial studying the value of warfarin or aspirin versus placebo in patients with a recent TIA or minor disabling stroke.</P>

<P>The two trials that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by both reviewers. Since one of the reviewers (PJK) is also the principal investigator of one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>), it was easy to collect information about the method of randomisation, blinding, type of analysis, and outcome measures. Peto odds ratios were used to combine the results of the two trials. We tested for heterogeneity between trials using a standard chi-square test.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 13:59:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The two included trials are the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT) (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>) and the Veterans Affairs Stroke Prevention in Nonrheumatic Atrial Fibrillation Study (VA-SPINAF) (<LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the EAFT, 1007 NRAF patients with a TIA or minor stroke within the preceding three months were divided into two groups, those without (group 1) or with (group 2) contraindications to anticoagulants. Patients in group 1 (n = 669) were randomised to treatment with open-label anticoagulants (target International Normalized Ratio (INR) range: 2.5 to 4.0), or double-blind treatment with 300 mg aspirin or matching placebo. Group 2 patients (n = 338) were randomised to double-blind treatment with aspirin or placebo. Forty-three percent were randomised within two weeks of stroke onset. For the purpose of this review, only the patients in group 1 were considered and those in group 1 randomised to aspirin were excluded, thus leaving 439 patients. The primary measure of outcome was the composite event of vascular death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or systematic embolism, whichever occurred first. The secondary analysis considered fatal or non-fatal stroke only. The mean duration of follow-up was of 2.3 years, and follow-up visits were planned four-monthly (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the VA-SPINAF study, which was primarily a primary prevention study, only 46 NRAF patients with a history of stroke were entered. The time since the cerebral ischaemic event was unknown. Patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with warfarin (prothrombin-time ratio, 1.2 to 1.5; estimated INR 1.4 to 2.8) or matching placebo. The primary end point was cerebral infarction. Secondary end points were cerebral haemorrhage or death from any cause. All patients were followed for three years or until the study was terminated. The mean duration of follow-up was of 1.7 years (<LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The included trials are multicentre randomised, controlled studies comparing open-label oral anticoagulants with no anticoagulant treatment (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>) or double-blind anticoagulant treatment versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>). In EAFT, balance between treatment assignments was achieved with random permutated blocks; treatment codes were distributed centrally by phone through a randomisation service, using pre-generated randomisation lists for each centre. In VA-SPINAF, patients were randomly assigned to receive warfarin or placebo according to lists generated by the Coordinating Centre.</P>
<P>In both studies, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. In the EAFT, the members of the Clinical Audit Committees were blinded to treatment, and so were the members of the Ends Point Committee in the VA-SPINAF. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-16 13:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In the group of patients in the EAFT without contraindication to anticoagulants, the annual rate of all vascular events was 8% in patients assigned to anticoagulants (n = 225) versus 17% in patients assigned to placebo (n = 214). The risk of stroke alone (disabling and non-disabling) was reduced from 12% to 4% per year. In absolute terms, 90 vascular events (mainly strokes) were prevented per 1000 patients treated with anticoagulants per year. The incidence of bleeding events (major or minor, intra- or extracranial) on anticoagulation was low (2.8% per year versus 0.7 per year in the placebo group). Despite a mean age of 71 years, the absolute annual excess of major bleeds was 21 per 1000 patients treated, and there was no documented intracerebral bleeding. There were 11/225 non-vascular deaths in the anticoagulant group versus 9/214 in the placebo group and 30/225 and 35/214 vascular deaths (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the VA-SPINAF study, four patients in the placebo group (n = 25) against two in the anticoagulant group (n = 21) suffered a recurrent stroke. The number of all vascular events was 8/21 in the warfarin group versus 11/25 in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 2.9). No intracranial bleeds occurred. The recurrence of stroke of 9.3% per year in placebo treated patients, and the odds reduction by anticoagulant therapy, were very similar to those found in the EAFT (<LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of the two trials combined show that anticoagulants are highly effective: they reduce the odds of recurrent stroke, disabling as well as non-disabling, by two-thirds (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.58) and almost halve the odds of all vascular events (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82). This benefit is not negated by an unacceptable increase of major bleeding complications (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.55 to 12.1). In the two studies, no intracranial bleeds were identified among patients using anticoagulants (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.49).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 14:00:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of the two studies indicate that in patients with NRAF and a recent TIA or minor ischaemic stroke, oral anticoagulant treatment almost halves the odds of serious vascular events. The odds of recurrent stroke, disabling as well as non-disabling, is decreased by two-thirds. Although there was a fourfold increase in serious bleeding complications, the absolute numbers were small (the annual excess was 21 per 1000 patients treated) so this benefit is not negated. The results of the secondary prevention studies are strikingly similar to those of the five primary prevention studies of NRAF patients, i.e. patients who had not had a recent TIA or ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-AFASAK-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFASAK 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BAATAF-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAATAF 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAFA-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAFA 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SPAF-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_SPINAF-1992" TYPE="STUDY">VA-SPINAF 1992</LINK>). The most important difference between the primary and secondary prevention studies is the much higher absolute incidence of recurrent stroke. The secondary prevention studies observed an annual incidence of 12% in the placebo treated group, which is almost three times as much as in the placebo treated groups of the primary prevention studies (4.5% per year) (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>). This makes the value of anticoagulation for secondary prevention even more impressive in absolute terms: 90 vascular events (mainly strokes) are prevented if 1000 patients are treated for one year.</P>
<P>A theoretical disadvantage of the EAFT is that anticoagulant treatment was not blinded. The results of the five primary prevention trials were published whilst the EAFT was still ongoing. This could have biased both the EAFT Auditing Committee and the individual investigators. Hospital admission for a major extracranial bleed might have been more likely for patients on anticoagulant. However, all members of the Audit Committee who assessed outcomes were absolutely blinded for the assigned study treatment. Furthermore, the majority of recurrent vascular events in this study were major, which left little room for inter-observer variation.</P>
<P>Although there were no intracranial bleeds in the patients treated with warfarin, there was a definite increase in major extracranial bleeding complications (2.8% per year versus 0.7% per year in the placebo group; OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.55 to 12.1) (<LINK REF="STD-EAFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EAFT 1993</LINK>). The EAFT Study Group performed an analysis to determine the intensity of oral anticoagulant therapy that provided the best balance between the prevention of thromboembolism and the occurrence of bleeding complications. They found that the target value for the INR should be set at 3.0, and values below 2.0 and above 5.0 should be avoided (<LINK REF="REF-EAFT-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAFT 1995</LINK>). A case-control study that analysed the lowest effective intensity of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with NRAF also found that the risk of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Hylek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hylek 1996</LINK>) and its severity rises steeply at INRs below 2.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Hylek-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hylek 2003</LINK>). <BR/>
<BR/>These studies do not provide information on the balance between risk and benefit of anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet drugs in the early period after onset of a cerebral ischaemic event in a patient with atrial fibrillation. Given the high efficacy of anticoagulation it may be that treatment should be started as soon as possible. However, several studies have recommended withholding anticoagulants during the first few days after suspected cardiogenic emboli to the brain, especially in patients with large infarcts (<LINK REF="REF-Olsson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larrue-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larrue 1997</LINK>). In one trial involving 449 patients, a low-molecular-weight heparin (compared to aspirin) did not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke during the first 14 days after a stroke that was attributed to atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-Berge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berge 2000</LINK>). However, in a large subgroup (3169 patients) of similar patients in a trial of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, heparin reduced the 14-day risk of ischaemic stroke by more than 50%, but an increase in brain haemorrhage eliminated this benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis are in line with a recently published individual patient meta-analysis of 4052 patients with NRAF with (24%) or without (76%) a previous stroke or TIA from six published randomised trials, in which oral anticoagulants were compared with aspirin, which is the mainstay of stroke prevention. Compared with aspirin, oral anticoagulant significantly decreased the risk of all strokes, ischaemic strokes, and cardiovascular events but modestly increased the absolute risk of major bleeding. The relative risk reduction was similar to our meta-analysis, but was smaller in absolute terms. The explanation lies in the higher stroke risk of those with a history of stroke or TIA. They found that in patients treated with aspirin stroke risk was 10% per year in those with a previous stroke versus only 2.7% per year in those without and was reduced to 4 and 1.5% per year respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Walraven 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review, based on two trials, EAFT and VA-SPINAF, imply that anticoagulants should be prescribed to patients with NRAF and a recent TIA or minor ischaemic stroke, unless there is a major contraindication, particularly those related to poor adherence and bleeding risk. Other evidence suggests that the target value for the INR should be set between 2.0 and 3.0 for safe and effective stroke prevention. Although the absolute benefits of anticoagulation are higher in secondary prevention, the risk of stroke warrants the use of warfarin in almost all patients with NRAF. There remains uncertainty about the ideal timing of initiating anticoagulant therapy. Acute therapy with low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin does not appear to be beneficial, the modest benefits being outweighed by the modest risks. It is generally recommended that oral anticoagulation be initiated after the first one to two weeks after stroke onset. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">When should anticoagulation be started following a stroke or TIA?</HEADING>
<P>We need to know how early anticoagulant treatment should be started in patients with NRAF and a recent TIA or minor stroke. Data for 3169 patients with AF from the International Stroke Trial show that treatment with heparin should not be started within the first two weeks after stroke, as the risk of bleeding complications in this phase is so high that it completely offsets the benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2001</LINK>). We do not know whether this also holds true for treatment with warfarin. The EAFT findings do not definitively answer this question since only 43% of the patients were randomised within two weeks after onset of neurological symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What is the optimum duration of treatment?</HEADING>
<P>The results do not definitively answer the question of how long antithrombotic treatment should be continued. In practice, the efficacy and safety of a troublesome therapy such as INR targeted warfarin treatment may be different from clinical trials, but the EAFT findings dispel the common notion that the risk of recurrent events is confined to the early period after the initial event. Both risk and benefit of treatment remained fairly constant during the relatively short period of follow-up (mean follow-up 2.3 years). In the primary prevention studies, a previous thromboembolic event was identified as an important risk factor for thromboembolic complications even if it had occurred years before. Thus, the available data suggest that both anticoagulant and aspirin treatment should be given for as long as possible, that is, until a contraindication occurs.</P>
