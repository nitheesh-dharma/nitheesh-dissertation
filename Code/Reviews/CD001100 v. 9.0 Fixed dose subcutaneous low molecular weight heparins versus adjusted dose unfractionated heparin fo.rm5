<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:01:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Background</P>
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the leg or pelvis (DVT) or the clot travels in the blood and blocks a blood vessel in the lungs (pulmonary embolism (PE)). The chances of getting a VTE can be increased if people have risk factors such as previous clots, prolonged periods of immobility (such as travelling on aeroplanes or bed rest), cancer, exposure to oestrogens (pregnancy, oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy), trauma and blood disorders such as thrombophilia (abnormal blood clotting). People with a VTE are treated with an anticoagulant, which prevents further clots from forming. Heparin is an anticoagulant and comes in two forms: low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). UFH is an older drug and is given either intravenously or by injection. When administering UFH, clinicians have to monitor blood-clotting factors carefully and adjust the dose, because of the variability of its effect. LMWH is given by subcutaneous injection once or twice a day and does not need to be monitored as closely as UFH.<BR/>
<BR/>Study characteristics and key results</P>
<P>This review included 29 randomised controlled trials involving 10,390 participants (current to September 2016), which compared LMWH or UFH for treating people with blood clots. Pooling the results of these trials showed that fewer participants treated with LMWH formed further blood clots and that fewer cases of bleeding occurred. Use of LMWH also reduced the size of the original blood clot when compared to the UFH group. There was no difference in number of deaths between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence</P>
<P>Results of this review indicate that LMWH may prevent further blood clots and bleeding in people with VTE. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to the moderate quality of the evidence as a result of lack of reporting of study methods and problems with study design. Results indicating reduced size of blood clots when taking LMWH also must be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of evidence as results were not similar across the studies.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:01:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies were added to this update resulting in a total of 29 included studies (n = 10,390). The quality of the studies was downgraded as there was a risk of bias in some individual studies relating to risk of attrition and reporting bias; in addition several studies did not adequately report on the randomisation methods used nor on how the treatment allocation was concealed.</P>
<P>During the initial treatment period, the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolic events was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants treated with UFH (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to 0.98; 6238 participants; 18 studies; P = 0.04; moderate-quality evidence). After a follow-up of three months, the period in most of the studies for which oral anticoagulant therapy was given, the incidence of recurrent VTE was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants with UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90; 6661 participants; 16 studies; P = 0.005; moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, at the end of follow-up, LMWH was associated with a lower rate of recurrent VTE than UFH (Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88; 9489 participants; 22 studies; P = 0.001; moderate-quality evidence). LMWH was also associated with a reduction in thrombus size compared to UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.82; 2909 participants; 16 studies; P &lt; 0.00001; low-quality evidence), but there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 56%). Major haemorrhages occurred less frequently in participants treated with LMWH than in those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 8780 participants; 25 studies; P = 0.02; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; 9663 participants; 24 studies; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:01:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review presents moderate-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment; and low-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced thrombus size when compared to UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (moderate-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria and downgraded due to concerns over risk of bias in individual trials together with a lack of reporting on the randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation methods used. The quality of the evidence for reduction of thrombus size was further downgraded because of heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-09 10:02:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (presence of a blood clot in the veins, VTE) has an incidence in the general population of approximately 0.1% per year. Its main manifestations are leg complaints, due to deep venous thrombosis (DVT), in the lower limb (blood clot in the deep veins of the leg), and signs of dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and pleuritic thoracic pain (chest pain) when a thrombus (clot) becomes dislodged and forms an embolism obstructing blood flow in the pulmonary circulation. Evidence suggests that although people may only complain about either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), in many cases the pathological manifestations are shared between these two clinically distinct conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Huisman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1983</LINK>). Therefore, increasingly they are referred to as one disease and are treated with comparable anticoagulant regimens.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:02:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anticoagulant therapy is the treatment of choice for most people with VTE (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). Present guidelines recommend initial therapy for DVT with a parenteral anticoagulant (unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux) followed by vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2012</LINK>). Heparin is administered by either continuous intravenous (IV) infusion or twice daily subcutaneous injection (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). Heparin dosage is monitored by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and adjusted to maintain the anticoagulant effect within a defined therapeutic range. For intravenous heparin therapy to achieve its minimal anticoagulant effect, the initial dosing needs to be either weight based (80 units/kg then 18 units/kg/hour) or a fixed dose using a 5000 unit bolus followed by at least 1250 units/hour (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2012</LINK>). Laboratory monitoring is necessary because the anticoagulant response to heparin is highly variable among people with VTE. Inadequate heparin dosing is related to an increased risk of VTE recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Turpie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpie 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of LMWH preparations and heparinoids have been developed for clinical use. Compared with UFH, LMWH preparations have a longer plasma half-life, less inter-individual variability in anticoagulant response to fixed doses and, in animal models, a more favourable antithrombotic to haemorrhagic ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1992</LINK>). As a result of their pharmacokinetic properties, a stable and sustained anticoagulant effect is achieved when LMWHs are administered subcutaneously once or twice daily, without laboratory monitoring. Although most experience with LMWHs has been in the prevention of VTE, where they have been shown to be safe and effective (<LINK REF="REF-Nurmohamed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurmohamed 1992</LINK>), there is accumulating evidence that these anticoagulants are also safe and effective for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolic events. This is the third update of the Cochrane Review first published in 1999.</P>

<P>We based reduction in thrombus size on the number of participants whose thrombus size reduced between pre- and post-treatment venograms. We used this outcome and each of the other dichotomous outcomes for the different treatments to calculate an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) separately for each trial. We then combined these ORs across studies, giving due weight to the number of events in each of the two treatment groups in each separate study using the Peto procedure, which assumes a fixed treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>).

Although <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 2003</LINK> reported incidence of recurrent VTE, there was a query regarding the exact number of participants reported to have this outcome. The author was contacted to clarify the data but did not respond and therefore this study was not included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Analysis of the pooled data from these studies demonstrated a reduction in recurrent venous thromboembolic events with LMWH during the initial treatment period (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98; moderate-quality evidence; participants = 6238; studies = 18; P = 0.04); at the end of follow-up (Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88; participants = 9489; studies = 22; P = 0.0005), at three months' follow-up (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90; moderate-quality evidence; participants = 6661; studies = 16; P = 0.005); and at six months' follow-up (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96; participants = 2841; studies = 7; P = 0.03). However, at one month's follow-up, no difference was found between LMWH and UFH (Peto OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44; participants = 1741; studies = 4; P = 0.65).</P>
<P>During the initial treatment, 54 (1.7%) of the 3123 participants allocated to LMWH had thrombotic complications versus 76 (2.4%) of the 3115 participants allocated to UFH. After a follow-up of three months, the period in most of the studies for which oral anticoagulant therapy was given, 122 (3.5%) of the 3440 participants treated with LMWH had a recurrent thrombotic event versus 164 (5.2%) of the 3221 participants treated with UFH.</P>
<P>When different preparations of heparin were compared, a reduction in recurrent VTE was noted during the initial treatment period for enoxaparin (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.98; participants = 1143; studies = 5; P = 0.04) and at the end of follow-up for certoparin (Peto OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99; participants = 2007; 3 studies; P = 0.05) versus UFH.

In all studies these venograms were adjudicated by investigators unaware of treatment allocation.

All other studies included in this review used concomitant VKA therapy and in order for our results to be comparable, data for this group of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 2003</LINK> study was not included in the analysis.</P>
<P>At the end of follow-up, 80 (3.5%) of the 2303 participants treated with LMWH had a symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic event versus 143 (6.0%) of the 2369 participants treated with UFH. This reduction was in favour of LMWH (Peto OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75; participants = 4672; studies = 10; P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). When analysed by LMWH preparation, reviparin was the only drug associated with a reduction in recurrent VTE (Peto OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63). Overall, no differences were observed between the heparin preparations in symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism at the end of follow-up.</P>
<P>LMWH was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of symptomatic, recurrent deep venous thrombosis as well as a reduction in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (respectively Peto OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; participants = 2681; studies = 7; P = 0.02; and Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74; participants = 3024; studies = 7; P = 0.002) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

<P>Analysis of the pooled data showed a reduction in major haemorrhagic complications in favour of LMWH (Peto OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85; participants = 3589; studies = 8; P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). At the end of the initial treatment period, 18 (1.0%) of the 1804 participants in the LMWH group versus 37 (2.1%) of the 1785 participants in the UFH group suffered a major haemorrhage. Tinzaparin was the only LMWH preparation associated with reduced rates of major haemorrhagic complications (Peto OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.59). Overall, no differences were observed between the heparin preparations in incidence of major haemorrhages during initial treatment.</P>
<P>Overall mortality at the end of follow-up demonstrated a reduction in favour of LMWH (Peto OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; participants = 4331; studies = 9; P = 0.002) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). In the LMWH group, 72 (3.3%) of the 2183 participants died versus 112 (5.2%) of the 2148 participants in the UFH group. Certorparin was the only LMWH preparation associated with a reduction in overall mortality (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:05:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes more than 9000 participants and indicates that this drug may be more efficacious than unfractionated heparin (UFH) for preventing recurrent VTE. Many of the included studies reported on other advantages of LMWH over UFH. Firstly, the route of administration (subcutaneous once or twice daily) is more convenient and increases the mobility of participants with VTE. Secondly, the pharmacokinetics are more predictable, which abolishes the need for laboratory monitoring and subsequent dose adjustments. Hence, LMWH can be advocated as the standard therapy for people with confirmed VTE. Treatment in an outpatient setting has been demonstrated to be feasible, safe and cost-effective for people with DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Belt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Belt 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analysis of all studies, regardless of methodological quality, showed that LMWH was associated with a lower incidence of recurrent VTE at the end of follow-up and at three and six months, with 95% CIs less than one (Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88, Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90 and Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96 respectively) but not after one month follow-up (Peto OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44). However, when sensitivity analysis was performed on studies that concealed allocation of treatment only, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism during initial treatment and after three months nor in the incidence of major haemorrhages between LMWH and UFH. We therefore judge that the quality of the evidence is moderate.</P>
<P>When we performed analyses according to the type of VTE index event, the rate of recurrent VTE at the end of follow-up remained lower in DVT participants treated with LMWH compared with DVT participants treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75). However, analysis in participants with PE showed no difference in the rate of recurrent VTE between the two treatment groups (Peto OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61). When we performed analyses according to mode of delivery of UFH, we found that LMWH was associated with fewer recurrent VTEs than intravenous UFH (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.86) but that there was no difference when LMWH was compared with subcutaneous UFH (Peto OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.95).</P>
<P>The tendency to improved efficacy with LMWH treatment was not at the cost of a higher rate of major haemorrhage. On the contrary, a reduction in major haemorrhage was demonstrated during the initial treatment period with LMWH. This is largely because the LMWH provides a more stable level of anticoagulation whereas unfractionated heparin dose adjustments may result in more peaks and troughs of anticoagulant effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:05:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although these results are promising, there are a number of unresolved issues. Firstly, since only approximately 25% of the participants included in this critical review had a diagnosis of primary pulmonary embolism, it can be argued that more data are required before conclusions can be drawn in this population. Secondly, although the combination of all preparations of LMWH seems logical, and heterogeneity could not be identified, current data do not discriminate between different LMWH preparations. A difference between LMWH preparations was only found for one outcome of the review, reduction in thrombus size. However, studies with large sample sizes and which include comparisons of different preparations are needed to determine whether the efficacy and safety of the individual LMWHs is actually comparable. Thirdly, Prandoni and colleagues noted that the route of administration might be relevant to heparin efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). When we limited the analysis to studies that used intravenous UFK, similar results as in the main analyses were observed. When the analysis was confined to those studies that used subcutaneous UFH we found no difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE and major haemorrhages. The lack of difference could be due to the smaller groups in this analysis.</P>
<P>The protocol for this review was published in 1997 and the first version of the review was published in 1998. Initial treatment of VTE has changed since then and, as a result, the current objective of this review is no longer as clinically relevant as before. Therefore, to reflect current practice, future updates of this review will include studies on fixed dose subcutaneous UFH. Additionally, in accordance with current VTE trials on direct-acting oral anticoagulants, future updates will assess symptomatic PE and symptomatic proximal DVT as the primary outcome. We will also assess side effects of treatment other than bleeding as an additional outcome.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to concerns arising from risk of bias in individual studies. One study was at risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Luomanmaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luomanmaki 1996</LINK>), six studies were at risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Breddin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Breddin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiessinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fiessinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindmarker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindmarker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninet-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ninet 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thery-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Thery 1992</LINK>), two studies were at risk of reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Lindmarker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindmarker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez-de-Llano-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez de Llano 2003</LINK>), and three studies were at risk for other types of bias including baseline differences between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Findik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Findik 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luomanmaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luomanmaki 1996</LINK>). A further reason for downgrading the evidence to moderate was that several studies did not adequately report on the methods used to generate the random sequence nor how treatment allocation was kept concealed.</P>
<P>While reductions in recurrent VTE and major haemorrhages were observed in the LMWH group compared with UFH when all studies were combined, in a sensitivity analysis of studies with adequate concealment of treatment allocation before randomisation, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent VTE during initial treatment and after three months nor in the incidence of major haemorrhages between LMWH and UFH. An explanation for these differences in effect size could be that the overall reductions are possibly biased by including less adequately performed studies without adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Where there were 10 or more studies in an analysis, we tested for publication bias using funnel plots. We found a suggestion of publication bias for three of the outcomes: incidence of recurrent VTE during initial treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1,</LINK> <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>);incidence of recurrent VTE at three months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>); and reduction in thrombus size (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). However, we felt it was insufficient to downgrade for publication bias. For the remaining outcomes, we found no evidence of publication bias for the analyses we tested (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-010.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-010.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.4</LINK>).</P>

<P>Neither of the authors of this review was involved in any of the included or excluded studies. Furthermore, neither has any commercial or other conflict of interest. The search was as comprehensive as possible; and the two review authors independently assessed all studies for inclusion. We are confident that we have included all relevant studies and we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process by performing data extraction and assessing study quality independently. However, the possibility remains that we may have missed studies which have not been published.</P>
<P>The original review did not set out to use the ISTH bleeding definition. However, given that this is now the standard accepted definition for major bleeding, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis for ISTH bleeding definitions in order to assess the effect of bleeding definitions used. The results from this sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>) are similar to the results from the analysis including all studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) irrespective of their definition of major and clinically relevant bleeding.</P>

<P>This review presents moderate-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment and low-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced thrombus size when compared to UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:05:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies are required to compare LMWH with UFH in the treatment of people with pulmonary embolism. In addition, a large RCT of at least two years' duration should be performed to determine the effects of dosing frequency on long-term sequelae of venous thromboembolism, such as the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Individual low molecular weight heparin preparations could be compared with each other and new drugs should now be compared with LMWH.</P>
