<P>This review determined to look at whether fast acting relievers performed better when they were delivered via different inhalers in people with asthma. The authors did not find differences between the devices in lung function measurements that exceeded what would be expected with the play of chance. HFA-metered dose inhalers reduced the requirement for oral steroids. However, the studies reported data in ways that prevented formal statistical combination. More research is required to establish more reliably whether the devices commonly used to deliver reliever medication provide similar efficacy and safety. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-18 15:29:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A number of different inhaler devices are available to deliver beta2-agonist bronchodilators in asthma. These include hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) or chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free propelled pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder devices.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical effectiveness of pMDI compared with any other available handheld inhaler device for the delivery of short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilators in non-acute asthma in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration Clinical Trials register was searched for studies as well as separate additional searches carried out on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and also on the Current Contents Index as well as the Science Citation Index. In addition, 17 individual online respiratory journals and 12 electronically available clinical trial databases were also searched. The UK pharmaceutical companies who manufacture inhaled asthma medication were contacted in order to obtain details of any published or unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-18 14:50:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The full texts of all potentially relevant articles were reviewed independently by two reviewers.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-18 15:29:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Fixed and random effect models were used. Dichotomous outcomes were assessed using Odds Ratios or Relative Risks (RR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighty-four randomised controlled trials were included in this review, but few could be combined to assess a specific outcome for a given delivery device comparison. Only two studies required demonstration of adequate pMDI technique as an entry requirement. There were no difference between a standard CFC containing pMDI and any other device for most outcomes. Regular use of HFA-pMDI containing salbutamol reduced the requirement for short courses of oral corticosteroids (3 trials, 519 patients: RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49, 0.91); however the total number of exacerbations were unchanged (3 trials, 1271 patients: RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.75, 1.33).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In patients with stable asthma, short-acting beta-2 bronchodilators in standard CFC-pMDI's are as effective as any other devices. The effect of HFA-pMDI on requirement for oral corticosteroid courses to treat acute exacerbations should be confirmed. Effectiveness studies that use an intention-to-treat analysis are required.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:43:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled therapy has become accepted as the mainstay of asthma treatment. It allows low doses of medication to be delivered directly to the site of action in the airways, significantly reducing systemic side effects compared with oral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>). An ever-increasing number of drugs are available to treat asthma, which can be divided broadly into two categories. Bronchodilators, which are, used for symptom relief and corticosteroids that are mainly used to control the inflammatory activity that is the underlying pathological process in asthma. A number of different inhalation devices are available including the pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) which is the most commonly used and cheapest inhaler device to be used with or without a spacer device. Other device types include the breath-actuated pMDIs (e.g. Autohaler, Easibreathe) and the dry powder inhalers (e.g. Turbuhaler, Diskhaler, Accuhaler, Rotahaler). This is now further complicated by the introduction of hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) or chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free propelled pMDIs with properties that may be different from the current CFC propelled pMDIs.</P>
<P>In clinical practice, the fundamental principle of prescribing is to use the most clinically and cost effective drug. Pressurised MDIs are usually regarded as first choice but their use is to a large degree dependent upon an individuals ability to co-ordinate their breathing to the actuation of the device. Greater than 50 to 80% of adults have difficulty using a pMDI (<LINK REF="REF-Crompton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crompton 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-Beerendonk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Beerendonk 1998</LINK>). This is a particular issue in the very young and old, particularly during acute exacerbations of their condition. In this circumstance, it is believed that the addition of a large volume spacer may be the cheapest effective alternative (<LINK REF="REF-North-England-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">North England 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Due to the bulkiness of large volume spacers, they are not very portable and this means that they are rarely used with "reliever medication" by young mobile asthma sufferers irrespective of clinical efficacy. For these reasons other devices are often prescribed in order to optimise compliance. This often determines which particular drug is prescribed as pharmaceutical companies usually limit inhaler use to their own products and some spacers do not fit other manufacturers inhaler devices.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical effectiveness of pMDI (with or without spacer device) compared with any other handheld inhaler device for the delivery of short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilators in non-acute asthma.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:43:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Due to the varying differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the short-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g. salbutamol, terbutaline, fenoterol) compared with longer-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g. formoterol, salmeterol) and anti-cholinergic bronchodilators (e.g. ipratropium, oxitropium) only the short-acting beta-2 bronchodilators were considered in this review. Salbutamol and terbutaline are the most widely used short acting beta-2 agonists bronchodilators with CFC-based MDIs, accounting for greater than 80% of all bronchodilator delivery devices sold in the UK. </P>
<P>Therefore, a study was considered for inclusion if it compared a single short-acting bronchodilator drug delivered using a standard pMDI (with or without spacer device) versus any other hand-held inhaler device (e.g. CFC-free pMDI, breath-actuated pMDI or a DPI).</P>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were considered for inclusion. Studies were either laboratory or community based, of any duration and conducted in patients with non-acute (stable) asthma.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children and adults with any degree of asthma severity were included. Asthma needed to be diagnosed by a physician or according to internationally accepted criteria (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-ATS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>) in order to be considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials were considered that compared clinical or patient oriented outcomes for a single short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilator delivered by a standard pMDI versus the same drug delivered by any other available hand-held inhaler device in non-acute asthma. Co-intervention and or contamination (e.g. from crossover designs) which may have occurred were recorded where possible.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Asthma and Wheeze Randomised Controlled Trials register was searched for studies as well as separate additional searches carried out on MEDLINE (1966-Jan 2001), EMBASE (1980-Jan 2001), CINAHL (1982-Jan 2001) and also on the CURRENT CONTENTS INDEX (1995-Jan 2001) as well as the SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (1995-Jan 2001). In addition 17 individual online journals known to publish respiratory articles were searched (American Journal of Respiratory &amp; Critical Care Medicine; American Medical Association; Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology; Archives of Disease in Childhood; Archives of Allergy &amp; Immunology; Applied Physiology; Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology; Chest; Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine; Lung; New England Journal of Medicine; Pediatrics; Pediatric Research; Pulmonary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics; Respiration; Respirology; Thorax). Twelve electronically available clinical trials databases were also searched (USA databases include: CenterWatch Clinical Trials; Controlled Clinical Trials; Current Controlled Trials; Society for Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials; National Jewish Medical &amp; Research Centre and the UK databases include: Center for Evidence-Based Medicine; Clinical Evidence; Clinical Trial Finder; NHS Centre for Reviews &amp; Dissemination; NHS National Research Register; GlaxoWellcome Clinical Trials). All citations were reviewed without language restriction. </P>

<P>The reference lists of all included studies and review articles were checked in order to identify any further relevant citations not captured by electronic and manual hand searching. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for any other unpublished studies. If more data was required for the systematic review the authors of the trials were contacted for additional information or clarification. </P>
<P>Experts and leaders in respiratory medicine were also contacted in order to locate any ongoing studies. </P>
<P>In addition, UK pharmaceutical companies who manufacture inhaled asthma medication were contacted in order to obtain details of any further published or unpublished studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SELECTION OF TRIALS</HEADING>
<P>Studies were retrieved from the title, abstract, or descriptors. Two reviewers (FR, DB) independently reviewed the literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text, using pre-defined criteria, two reviewers (FR, DB) independently selected trials for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were: (1) Trials of a single beta-2 agonist bronchodilator delivered by a standard pMDI (with or without spacer) versus any other hand-held inhaler device in non-acute asthma, including HFA or CFC-free inhalers, (2) Randomised controlled trial [A, B or C: Cochrane categories], (3) Patients age greater than 2 years with asthma diagnosed by a clinician or according to internationally accepted criteria [BTS, ATS, ERS] &amp; (4) Laboratory or community based study of any duration. All studies that did not meet the above criteria were excluded. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or third party adjudication (JW). Selected studies subsequently excluded on methodological grounds were identified and the reason for exclusion recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">QUALITY ASSESSMENT</HEADING>
<P>Methodological quality assessment was performed on all included studies using the following methods. Firstly using the Cochrane approach for the assessment of allocation concealment, all trials were scored according to the following grades:<BR/>
<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment<BR/>Grade D: Not used</P>
<P>In addition, the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) (shown below) which evaluates the quality of randomisation, blinding, and description of withdrawals and dropouts was also used. The Jadad scale has three items: one point is allocated for randomisation, blinding, and description of withdrawals and drop-outs; an extra point can be added for methods of randomisation and blinding that are well described and adequate. Studies that used a clearly inadequate method of randomisation or blinding (such as alternating patients) lose the point allocated. The maximum score is five points and studies scoring below three points are usually regarded as being of low methodological quality.</P>
<P>Jadad scale:<BR/>1) Was the study described as randomised (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>2) Was the study described as double-blind (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>3) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>4) Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>5) Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>6) Deduct 1 point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">DATA EXTRACTION</HEADING>
<P>Data abstraction of descriptive characteristics and study results was performed by one reviewer (FR) and was checked for accuracy by an independent person (SW). If data were not reported in an extractable form, one of the authors of the included study was contacted for additional information. If the authors could not be contacted or if the information was no longer available, this was reported. Where no original data were available from the authors, expansion of graphical representation of data from manuscripts was used to estimate the missing data. For studies where standard errors (SE) were reported, these were converted to standard deviations (SD) using square root of (n-1) x reported SE. Where studies reported the mean and the range, an estimation for SD was made by dividing the range by 4 {i.e. (HR-LR) / 4}. Where studies reported 90% or 95% confidence intervals the appropriate formula was used for estimating the SD's: CI = mean +- 2.58 x SE or CI = mean +- 1.96 x SE, and the equation solved for SE and converted to SD using the formula provided above.</P>
<P>All of the included studies reported continuous outcomes as mean values post bronchodilator except 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dockhorn-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Dockhorn 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dockhorn-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Dockhorn 1995b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hawksworth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hawksworth 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newhouse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Newhouse 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nieminen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nieminen 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramsdell-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsdell 1999a</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Ramsdell-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsdell 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Seppala-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Seppala 1998b</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-Silvasti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silvasti 1993</LINK>) in which mean maximum values (post bronchodilator) were reported.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">DATA ENTRY</HEADING>
<P>Data from the studies was abstracted onto a Microsoft Excel worksheet from where it was entered into RevMan 4.1. To check the accuracy of entered data, the double-entry form in RevMan 4.1 was utilised and an independent person checked all the entries.</P>
<P>Throughout the review the term 'pMDI' refers to a CFC-containing pressurised metered dose inhaler.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</HEADING>
<P>Trials were combined for meta-analysis using RevMan 4.1. Both a fixed effect model (where only with-in study variation is taken to influence the uncertainty of the weighted mean results) and a random effect model (in which both within-study and between-study variations are included in the assessment of the uncertainty of the overall mean results) were used. Both models were used so that if there were significant heterogeneity within the results of the included studies, it would be seen in the wider confidence intervals of the random effect model as opposed to the fixed effect model.</P>
<P>Dichotomous outcomes such as exacerbation rate or adverse events were assessed using relative risks (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI's) and where possible the Number-Needed-to-Treat for Benefit (NNT) calculated. However most of the outcomes of interest in asthma are either continuous or categorical data such as the level of asthma symptoms, which are usually treated as if they were continuous data. Data from each of the continuous outcomes were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI's if the they are reported with the same scales (e.g. FEV1 L/min change from baseline). Continuous data were also analysed as standardised mean differences (SMD) if different scales were used (e.g. FEV1 L/min &amp; FEV1 % predicted &amp; FEV1 L/min changed from baseline &amp; FEV1 L/min absolute value at end of study treatment).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies being pooled was tested for each outcome measure. If heterogeneity were present (p&lt;0.05), subgroup analyses were planned to explore possible reasons for heterogeneity of study results. A priori defined subgroups were based on; asthma severity, type of beta-2 bronchodilator or use of a spacer device with the pMDI.</P>
<P>Publication or selection bias was tested by preparing funnel plots (Egger 1997). These were plots of standard error versus effect size, which was plotted for all the trials under any particular outcome. Funnel plot asymmetry may indicate statistical evidence of publication or selection bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">DATA ANALYSIS</HEADING>
<P>There were a large number of studies included in this review and the data analysis was grouped as follows:</P>
<P>(A) Studies in adults</P>
<P>(1) Crossover design studies:</P>
<P>Pressurised metered dose inhalers compared against each of the different hand-held inhaler devices (Turbuhaler, Diskhaler, CFC-free or HFA pMDI, Rotahaler, Spiros, Spinhaler, Easyhaler, Multiple dose dry powder inhaler, Clickhaler, Gentlehaler and Autohaler). Each of these comparisons was further separated into either; short-term (min-hours), long term (days-months) or cumulative dosing studies. Study outcomes were presented in three main ways; so data were further separated as mean absolute values, percentage change from baseline and absolute change from baseline.</P>
<P>Where trials examined early (15-45 min) as compared to late (hours) pulmonary function variables post-bronchodilator, these were reported separately as we considered the early and late effects for beta-2 bronchodilators to be clinically different. These early measurements of study variables were presented as a separate comparison (from the rest of the data) as shown in comparison 24 in the 'Table of Comparisons'.</P>
<P>There is disagreement on the approach to meta-analysis of crossover trials, so we had hoped to use only the first arm of the data in our analysis. These data were not reported in most studies and neither were any data on variance, which would have allowed us to conduct an inverse variance pooling in order to observe if outcomes were different. However, where studies or authors did provide the data (individual patient and not group means), we were able to test the effect of the RevMan software treating data from crossover studies as parallel data. In practice, the standard deviation was found to be very similar when the data were analysed in the two separate ways. The variability seems to be as high when comparing the same patient with himself or herself as opposed to when comparing the group means with each other. This indicates that analysing the data from crossover studies as if it were parallel data does not give different results. Therefore, the aggregate result (combined data from both arms of crossover studies) were used.</P>
<P>In cumulative dosing studies, we used the pulmonary function and other study measurements made after the final dose. We recognise that in most cases the total cumulative dose given in such studies would be much higher than that used in practice and may have reached the plateau of the dose-response curve. However, we hoped that pre-defined criteria would minimise any potential bias, as the reviewer was not able to choose the 'most relevant' dose from the many different doses used in these cumulative dosing studies.</P>
<P>(2) Parallel design studies:</P>
<P>Pressurised metered dose inhalers compared against all other hand-held inhaler devices including all DPI's and HFA devices. Each of these comparisons was further separated into either; short-term (min-hours), long term (days-months) or cumulative dosing studies.</P>
<P>(3) Challenge testing studies:</P>
<P>These studies used either methacholine, histamine or exercise challenge (usually causing a decrease in lung function after challenge) to test the bronchoprotective potential of administered beta-2 agonist bronchodilator from inhaler devices. The pMDI was compared against all other hand-held inhaler devices including all DPI's and HFA devices. Each of these comparisons was further separated into either; short-term (min-hours) or cumulative dosing studies.</P>
<P>(4) Different doses in devices compared:</P>
<P>We separated studies where different doses were used in the devices being compared (e.g. 100 mcg salbutamol from the pMDI versus 200 mcg from the Diskhaler). Pressurised metered dose inhalers compared against other hand-held inhaler devices including all DPI's and HFA devices. Each of these comparisons was further separated into either; short-term (min-hours), long term (days-months) or cumulative dosing studies.</P>
<P>(B) Studies in Children:</P>
<P>It was considered important to separate studies in children from adults. Pressurised metered dose inhalers were compared with each of the different hand-held inhaler devices including: Turbuhaler, Rotahaler and CFC-free or HFA pMDI. Each of these device comparisons was further separated into the different study designs (crossover, parallel or challenge-testing designs).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-18 15:48:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The number of studies were as follows: single-dose studies (n=45), long-term (n=16) and cumulative dosing studies (n=17); crossover design studies (n=62); parallel designs (n=10); different or double dosing schedules used in devices compared (n=6); challenge studies (n=9) and studies in children (n=13). Some studies could be listed in more than one category.</P>
<P>The oldest included study was published in 1977 and the newest in August 2000. There were equal numbers of included studies that were performed by pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical organisations. Studies that were included were conducted in many different parts of the world (New Zealand, Sweden, England, Germany, USA, Canada, UK, Belgium, Norway, Scotland, Hong Kong, Finland, Denmark, Australia and The Netherlands). There was a wide range of doses of beta-2 agonist used in the included studies. For salbutamol: single dose studies 100 mcg to cumulative dose studies up to 4200 mcg. Terbutaline: single doses of 0.25 mg up to cumulative doses of 4.0 mg. Fenoterol single doses of 200 mcg to 100 mcg. Salbutamol was used as the bronchodilator in 64 studies, terbutaline in 15 and fenoterol in five.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies recruited adult patients but 13 studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0033_M-UK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">3M UK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahlstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colice-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colice 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Croner-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Croner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Custovic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Custovic 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuglsang-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fuglsang 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hultquist-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hultquist 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laberge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Laberge 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Razzouk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Razzouk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svenonius-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Svenonius 1994</LINK>) involved children with asthma. Most of the studies included patients with mild-to-moderate asthma however, some of the trials did not describe asthma severity. In most crossover studies baseline FEV1 was not permitted to vary greater than 10-15% from pre-dose baseline values on study days and if variation was greater than 10-15% the visit was rescheduled.</P>
<P>A possible problem with RCTs is that patients are usually selected on the basis of being able to use a pMDI device as an inclusion criteria therefore, the study results would favour pMDI use. The majority (82/84) of RCTs included in this review did not mention previous patient familiarisation with either the pMDI or the DPIs as a requirement for study entry. The two studies that reported adequate pMDI device technique as an entry criteria were trials comparing the standard pMDI to HFA pMDI (<LINK REF="STD-Kleerup-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kleerup 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bleecker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bleecker 1998</LINK>). Although proper inhaler device use was not a requirement for entry into the study most of the trials did report training all patients in the proper use of both pMDI and the DPIs prior to the start of the trial. However, we should assume that all patients recruited in the included RCTs were taught to use both the pMDI and the DPIs prior to commencing the study.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:40:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Most of the studies included in this review were of good quality with all scoring a 'B' grade or better when using the Cochrane allocation concealment grading and &gt;3 when using the Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) 5-point scoring system for study quality. Four of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hawksworth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hawksworth 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Langley-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 1998a</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-Vidgren-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Vidgren 1990</LINK>) were reported as abstracts and were therefore devoid of substantial details for critical appraisal. The most frequently encountered problem was that many of the included studies were designed as tests of the superiority of one device over another in which the null hypothesis was of equal efficacy. Such studies require fewer patients than those designed to test equivalence (null hypothesis than one device is superior to the other). Thus most studies were underpowered. Failure to detect a difference does not necessarily imply equivalence.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:40:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>SEARCH FOR STUDIES<BR/>The electronic search yielded 1,130 citations: 40 references were found in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and online respiratory journal databases, 1,063 citations came from the Airways Group register. Additional 27 references were obtained from bibliographic searching of relevant articles. Of a total of 1,130 abstracts, 182 studies were identified independently by two reviewers as being potentially suitable for inclusion. After reading the full text of these 182 studies, the first author (FR) excluded 66 studies. Of the remaining 116 studies, 27 were excluded by at least two reviewers giving a total of 93 excluded studies (reasons for exclusion are provided in, Characteristics of Excluded Studies) and 89 included studies (with 9 studies being duplicate publications of studies already included). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borgstr_x00f6_m-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Borgström 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dockhorn-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Dockhorn 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Geoffroy-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Geoffroy 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Langley-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 1998a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramsdell-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsdell 1999a</LINK>) reported more than one trial in their article or had additional independent study arms that met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>QUALITY OF INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>All included studies were of good methodological quality (Cochrane B and Jadad score &gt;3). They were all randomised with most of the studies being double-blinded and all used adequate allocation concealment. We wrote to 78 authors of the 84 included studies for further information and received 33 replies. The low response rate was not surprising as the oldest included trial was published in 1977. Any replies or data received from authors after publication of this review will be incorporated in future updates of the review.<BR/>

Oral corticosteroid requirement use was reported as dichotomous data in 519 patients (156 in pMDI group &amp; 363 in the HFA-pMDI group) [Comparison 39:04]. Use of HFA-pMDI containing salbutamol significantly reduced the number of patients who required additional treatment with short courses of oral steroids (RR 0.67; 95%CI 0.49,0.91).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-18 16:39:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>There have been a number of trials comparing the standard pMDI with other types of hand-held inhaler devices containing beta-2 agonists. These have been conducted with varying designs and with the data presented in many different forms. Their results are conflicting. To our knowledge, there are no previous systematic reviews. The aim of this review was to determine if there were any differences in clinical effectiveness between the standard pMDI and any other available hand-held inhaler device. This was a large review of 84 included studies, which included 205 different outcome measures. The number of studies that could be combined in a meta-analysis was limited by inconsistencies in the measurement and reporting of these outcomes.</P>
<P>There were significant differences between the pMDI and the Turbuhaler, HFA-pMDI, Rotahaler, Spinhaler and MDPI for the following outcome measures: patient preference, heart rate and oral steroid requirement.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">ADULTS</HEADING>
<P>HFA (CFC-free)-pMDI - Short course oral corticosteroid requirement for the treatment of acute exacerbations<BR/>Use of HFA-pMDI containing salbutamol significantly reduced the number of patients requiring treatment with short courses of oral corticosteroids [Comparison 39:04]. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsdell-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsdell 1999a</LINK> acute exacerbations were reported to be similar in the two study groups with 23% of patients having acute exacerbations in both treatment groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1999</LINK> the number of patients experiencing acute exacerbations were not reported but they did report the percentage of patients requiring nebulised salbutamol during the study period (pMDI 19% vs. HFA-pMDI 4%). In addition, the Ramsdell 1999 study combined the results of two separate studies (Part A: a 12 week pilot study and Part B: a 12 month study). Upon completion of the pilot, RCT (Part A) subjects were entered into another study (Part B). Subjects who had received either HFA-pMDI or placebo in Part A were assigned to treatment with HFA-pMDI in Part B (this was done so that the patients would not be unblinded to the device being used). Patients who received CFC-pMDI in the pilot study A were randomised to either HFA-pMDI or CFC-pMDI in study B. Intervals between the two studies (Parts A and B) was a week. It can be argued that such allocation of patients may introduce bias. Exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Ramsdell-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsdell 1999a</LINK> (Study Part A) from the comparison because of inappropriate patient allocation renders the overall result non-significant. Neither trial reported use of inhaled corticosteroids during the study period. The frequency and dose of salbutamol administration from the two inhaler devices were similar in both studies. Additional reliever medication was allowed as required, however, neither study provided this information. There were no significant differences in FEV1, AUC-FEV1, adverse effects or exacerbation rate between the study groups in these trials. Nevertheless, if the requirement for oral steroid can be decreased, it would help reduce some of unwanted side effects associated with oral steroid use. Comparative studies with CFC-pMDI have shown greater lung bioavailability (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996</LINK>), higher dose delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Chavan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavan 1997</LINK>) and improved protection against increased asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Klinger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klinger 1998</LINK>) with the use of HFA-pMDI containing salbutamol. In a recent 20 month study HFA-pMDI salbutamol use, was also shown to consistently lower the requirement for reliever medication compared to CFC-pMDI (<LINK REF="REF-Boccuzzi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boccuzzi 2000</LINK>). These and other explanations may relate to HFA-pMDIs greater effectiveness in reducing oral steroid requirement and treatment failure as seen in our review. The possibility of improvement in dosing characteristics with HFA-pMDI may translate into enhanced economic outcomes not only in decreasing the requirement for reliever medication and better symptom control but also in decreasing oral steroid requirement.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">TURBUHALER - Heart Rate</HEADING>
<P>Three crossover studies in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Bondesson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bondesson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johnsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsen 1988</LINK>) showed that heart rate were lower by 4-10 bpm with pMDI compared to Turbuhaler. This suggests that there is less systemic absorption of the inhaled dose from the pMDI. This finding is in agreement with previously published study (<LINK REF="STD-Borgstr_x00f6_m-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Borgström 1996b</LINK>) which showed that percentage pulmonary deposition of inhaled drug is lower with the use of pMDI when compared to Turbuhaler (8.3% &amp; 22.0%, respectively, after a nominal dose of 0.5 mg terbutaline). Due to the short half-life of beta-2 bronchodilators, unwanted effects of higher heart rate with the use of any DPI device would be short-lived and the clinical importance of such an increase in heart rate with the Turbuhaler device is not clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">ROTAHALER - Preference</HEADING>
<P>This is an old device that has been superseded by newer delivery systems in many markets. Three crossover studies in adults (one short-term; <LINK REF="STD-Boye-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Boye 1983</LINK> &amp; two long-term studies: <LINK REF="STD-Hartley-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hartley 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kiviranta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviranta 1985</LINK>) showed that patients preference for the pMDI was two times greater than for the Rotahaler. Two long-term studies in children (one using different dose; <LINK REF="STD-Croner-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Croner 1980</LINK> and the other a parallel design study; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1989</LINK>) also showed that children preferred the pMDI compared to the Rotahaler. From the limited number of trials reporting this outcome, we are not able to make any firm conclusions on patient inhaler preference for any of the other inhaler devices. Also patient's preference is a potentially important outcome but its value is restricted since the grounds on which the patient's preferences are made are not known. It could be because of efficacy, ease of use, convenience or a combination of all three.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">CHILDREN</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies compared pMDI with other inhaler devices for inhaled beta-2 agonist drugs in children. The small number of children's studies allowed limited pooling of results so no overall conclusions could be drawn. From the limited data available, this review could find little or no evidence for additional clinical benefit of DPI devices over a standard pMDI for children with stable asthma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">TURBUHALER - Adverse Events</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlstrom 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fuglsang-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fuglsang 1989</LINK>) showed a decrease in adverse events when using the Turbuhaler. However, caution should be used in interpreting this result as these studies included different study designs. <LINK REF="STD-Ahlstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlstrom 1989</LINK> was a 14 day study whereas <LINK REF="STD-Fuglsang-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fuglsang 1989</LINK> was a cumulative dosing study lasting just over an hour and the adverse events reported in each study were coughing and tremor, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">NON-SIGNIFICANT REVIEW FINDINGS</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis of the data available from 84 randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review, found no statistically significant (p&gt;0.05) differences in patients (whether adults or children) who had stable asthma, when a standard pMDI was compared to any of the other ten hand-held inhaler devices (Turbuhaler, Diskhaler, HFA-pMDI, Rotahaler, Spiros, Easyhaler, MDPI, Clickhaler, Gentlehaler and Autohaler) for the following parameters: pulmonary lung function, asthma symptoms, use of additional relief medication, inhaled steroid requirement, acute exacerbation, blood pressure, bronchial hyperreactivity or systemic bioavailability.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">STUDIES WITH DIFFERENT DOSES IN INHALER DEVICES</HEADING>
<P>Studies using 2:1 or greater dosing did not provide results that were different from 1:1 dosing studies, except in only one study with children (<LINK REF="STD-Croner-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Croner 1980</LINK>) where daily PEFR was significantly higher in the group using the Rotahaler device. Such 2:1 or greater dosing schedules used to show 'clinical superiority' of one inhaler device over another provide no clinical evidence in support of the prescribing recommendations commonly promoted by pharmaceutical companies of a 2:1 dosing between two different devices and approved by regulatory authorities. Pharmaceutical companies usually use in vitro lung deposition studies to support lower dosing schedules. To our knowledge there are no clinical trials in support of 2:1 or greater dosing schedule for beta-2 agonists. Furthermore, this review found that there are no differences in clinical effectiveness whether 1:11 or2:1 dosing schedules are used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">STRENGTHS OF THE REVIEW</HEADING>
<P>This review includes an extensive search for studies that was conducted without any language restriction. It also includes searches from respiratory journals that have been hand-searched and searches from individual online journals and clinical trial databases. Selection of studies for inclusion and data abstraction was conducted and checked independently by two reviewers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">WEAKNESSES OF THE REVIEW</HEADING>
<P>The most frequently encountered problem with this review was that many of the included studies were designed as tests of the superiority of one device over another in which the null hypothesis was of equal efficacy. Such studies require fewer patients than those designed to test equivalence (null hypothesis than one device is superior to the other). Thus most studies were underpowered. Failure to detect a difference should not necessarily imply equivalence as trials designed to compare efficacy increase the chances of type II error.</P>
<P>Another problem with such trials is that patients are usually selected on the basis of being able to use a pMDI device as an inclusion criteria, therefore the results would favour pMDI use. The majority of the RCTs included in this review did not report previous patient familiarisation with either the pMDI or the DPIs as a requirement for study entry. Therefore the results of this review appear applicable to most patients with stable asthma. Although, adequate pMDI device technique was not a requirement for entry into the study, we should assume that all patients recruited in the RCTs included were taught to use both the pMDI and the DPIs prior to commencing the study.</P>
<P>Publication bias is a threat to the validity of most systematic reviews, it is unlikely to have had an important impact in this review since there was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry in any of the comparisons.</P>
<P>A pitfall of crossover studies, such as those included in this review, is the presence of carry-over effects of the first treatment period into the second treatment period, leading to an underestimation of the real difference among treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Cleophas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleophas 1993</LINK>). In the crossover studies included, treatment with short-acting beta2-agonists did not seem to alter (the second arm) pre-bronchodilator respiratory function (FEV1), and if lung function did differ by greater than 10-15% from pre-dose baseline values than the patient was excluded from the study or the second arm visit rescheduled (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f6_fdahl-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Löfdahl 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hetzel-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hetzel 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johnsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsen 1988</LINK>). This suggests that carry-over effects are unlikely to have occurred in most of the included studies, despite their crossover design and since most studies did include a washout period (see table: "Characteristics of Included Studies").</P>
<P>Another possible pitfall is the software used (RevMan 4.1) for the meta-analysis as crossover studies are treated as if they were parallel studies. It is known (<LINK REF="REF-Cleophas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleophas 1996</LINK>) that these two study designs (crossover and parallel) give identical results if the response to the two treatments in the same individual is completely unrelated, but parallel analysis may lead to decreased statistical power when compared to paired analysis, if the response to the two treatments is positively correlated (i.e. if patients improving during bronchodilator treatment from one device are also likely to improve during treatment with another device). This is the case in our review, since patients were responsive to both inhaler devices in all studies, as both comparative groups in all included crossover studies contained active treatment. Unfortunately, none of the studies reported the correlation between the responses to the inhaler devices used and majority of the studies did not provide any data on variance which would have allowed us to conduct inverse variance pooling in order to observe if results were different from the two analysis. Where studies or authors did provide the data (individual patient and not group means), we were able to test the effect of the RevMan software treating data from crossover studies as parallel data. Reassuringly the standard deviation was very similar when the data was analysed in the two separate ways. The variability seemed to be as high when comparing the same patient with himself or herself as opposed to when comparing the patient group means with each other. This indicates that analysing the data from crossover studies as if it was parallel data does not give different results. However, we cannot totally exclude that our analysis underestimated the statistical significance of the observed differences, as compared to a paired analysis. In this review studies using a parallel design were analysed separately from crossover designed studies.</P>
<P>Another possible weakness of this review has been the inaccessibility of data on outcomes known to have been measured (but unreported), and data not presented in a form that can be combined in the meta-analysis. This may be a confounding factor in the results and thus the conclusions. In particular, if pharmaceutical companies provided data from their large studies it could have appreciably added to this review. We believe that there is a need for journals editors (and the duty of all authors) to fully and explicitly report all results, methodology and details from studies so that trials can be duplicated in the exact manner in which they were conducted without readers having to infer what was probably done. Poor reporting of study data restricts not only duplication of studies but also makes the task of conducting a systematic review difficult. It is hoped that all authors publishing trials are aware of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS</HEADING>
<P>A range of different devices is available for the delivery of inhaled drugs in patients with chronic asthma. This, and the competing claims of the manufacturers, may make it difficult for prescribers to choose the best device for different patients. The results discussed here are clearly average results drawn from groups of patients. Overall it appears that the standard pMDI remains a suitable delivery system for beta-2 agonists therapy for many patients. Furthermore, it is convenient and inexpensive. This conclusion must be qualified that specific groups of patients with special needs such as the very young, physically impaired and elderly were not well represented in these studies. We conclude that the pMDI should be the first delivery system tried in a patient and that it will prove to be suitable for many. If it is not suitable then other devices should be evaluated on an individual patient basis.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In stable asthma, short-acting beta-2 bronchodilators in standard CFC-pMDI's are as effective as dry powder inhalers, Autohalers and CFC-free or HFA-pMDI's. Selection of inhaler device for an individual patient should begin with a pMDI with more expensive devices being used only if the standard pMDI cannot be used reliably. This recommendation is restricted to older children and adults with asthma. There are no data to provide clear guidance on device selection for the very young, elderly or physically impaired. Professionals advising patients should be encouraged to use the cheapest drug delivery device that the patients can use while always considering patient preference, adverse events and compliance as important factors.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Due to the differences in study methodologies employed by the trials included in this review, there is need for further good quality randomised controlled trials in order to resolve some of the outstanding issues highlighted in this review. Studies should have sufficient statistical power to demonstrate "superior effect" rather than accept "equivalence". Studies should employ adequate washout periods if using a crossover design and data reported in absolute terms both at baseline and at study completion, and or report percentage and absolute differences from baseline for all outcomes measures in the study, not only significant differences. </P>
<P>Further randomised-controlled trials are needed in order to be able to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of the various inhaler devices available for the treatment of asthma. This is of particular importance due to the phasing out of CFC propellants in pMDI's. </P>
<P>There is a need for further studies using HFA-pMDI containing salbutamol used on an "as-required" basis in order to observe any effects on oral steroid requirement. Additional gaps highlighted in this review that need to be addressed in future trials using bronchodilators and comparing inhaler devices include: quality of life measures, patient compliance, days of work/school, patient preference, nocturnal awakening, asthma symptoms and adverse effects.</P>
