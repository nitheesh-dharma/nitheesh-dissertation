<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Use of antimotility drugs (Loperamide, Diphenoxylate, Codeine) to control prolonged diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People with HIV/AIDS often develop prolonged diarrhoea which are sometimes not caused by infections. This is more so in the sub-Saharan Africa where drugs for controlling HIV itself i.e. antiretroviral drugs (ARV) may not be widely available or affordable. prolonged diarrhoea often results in prolonged illness and death due to loss of fluids, if not treated effectively and on time. Antimotility drugs and adsorbents are readily available and are used to try to control this condition while efforts are made to receive ARVs. We did not find enough evidence to support or refute their use in controlling this condition.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>AIDS-related diarrhoea is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV positive individuals, especially in the sub-Saharan Africa where 70% of deaths from HIV occur. It often compromises quality of life both in those receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the ART naive. Empirical antidiarrhoeal treatment may be required in about 50% of cases which are non-pathogenic or idiopathic and in cases resulting from antiretroviral therapy. Antimotility agents (Loperamide, Diphenoxylate, Codeine) and adsorbents (Bismuth Subsalicylate, Kaolin/Pectin, Attapulgite) are readily available, and have been found to be useful in this condition and so, are often used. Antimotilitics are opioids, decreasing stool output by reducing bowel activity thereby increasing fecal transit time in the gut, promoting fluid and electrolyte retention while adsorbents act by binding to fluids, toxins and other substances to improve stool consistency and eliminate the toxins. Due to its potential impact on the management of chronic diarrhoea in persons with HIV/AIDS, we reviewed the effectiveness of antimotility agents in controlling chronic diarrhoea in immunocompromised states caused by HIV/AIDS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of antimotility agents in controlling chronic diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Register and AIDSearch databases in November 2006. We also contacted WHO, CDC, pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field for information on previous or on-going trials and checked reference list from retrieved studies, irrespective of language and publication status.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing an antimotility agent or an adsorbent with another antimotility agent, placebo, an adsorbent or no treatment in children and adults diagnosed with HIV and presenting with diarrhoea of three or more weeks duration.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently undertook study selection and examined full articles of potentially eligible studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial was found assessing the use of an adsorbent (attapulgite) compared to a placebo for chronic diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS. It included 91 adults (Aged 18 to 60), diagnosed with AIDS and experiencing diarrhoea for at least 7 days. There was no evidence that attapulgite is superior to placebo in controlling diarrhoea by reducing stool frequency and normalising stool consistency on days 1 (0.34 (95% CI 0.01 - 8.15)), 3 (1.35 (95% CI 0.51 - 3.62)) and 5 (1.74 (95% CI 0.89 - 3.38)). This was a small trial and may not have had enough power to show evidence of effects. Five deaths were reported which was not classified according to the arms of the study.</P>
<P>Studies assessing the use of antimotility agents were not found. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review highlights the absence of evidence for the use of antimotility agents and adsorbents in controlling diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS. While no trials assessing the use of Antimotilitics were found, the retrieved study showed that attapulgite was not better than placebo in controlling diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients . For optimum patient care, these agents can still be used, with greater emphasis placed on adjunct therapies like massive fluid replacement while evidence for practice is awaited from further studies and reviews. <BR/> </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-12 17:57:35 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a global pandemic and has been reported in almost every country of the world. About 66% (22 million) of the estimated 33 million infected people are in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 1.3 million children under 15 years are living with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). Of the nearly 3 million HIV/AIDS deaths that occurred globally in 2005, 2 million (70%) were in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>HIV/AIDS is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection but it is also transmitted by blood and blood products and vertically from infected mothers to their children. It presents with a lowered ability to resist infections (immunodeficiency) resulting from a progressive depletion in the appropriate component of white blood cells (CD4 T-lymphocytes) from direct infection and destruction of these cells by HIV. This predisposes the individual to a myriad of opportunistic infections. The common opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS are <I>pneumocystis jiroveci</I> (formerly carinii) pneumonia , tuberculosis (TB), bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis, unexplained chronic diarrhoea, toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, etc (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). From the current classification of HIV/AIDS, people with CD4 cell counts less than 350/µL are at high risk of developing opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>) with the more severe ones occurring when counts are below 200/µL. Chronic diarrhoea and HIV wasting syndrome appear more common in low income settings (<LINK REF="REF-Deschamps-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deschamps 2000</LINK>).
<BR/>

<BR/>About 90% of persons living with HIV/AIDS develop diarrhoea of more than seven days at sometime. This can lead to, dehydration, significant weight loss, malnutrition, malabsorption and can result in increased mortality. It may exacerbate the immunodeficiency state (<LINK REF="REF-Pape-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pape 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fifty to 60 percent of cases of diarrhoeal in HIV/AIDS patients are due to an identifiable infection (<LINK REF="REF-Carcamo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carcamo 2005</LINK> ). Common isolates include bacteria and parasites although some may have infections with multiple organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Katabira-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katabira 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pape-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pape 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gassama-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gassama 2001</LINK>). Some studies show non-pathogenic or unexplained diarrhoea in about 50% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Dryden-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dryden 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mwachari-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mwachari 1998</LINK>). This results from malignancies (Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma), (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2000</LINK>), malabsorption, idiopathic causes (possibly from HIV infection) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>) and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) especially those containing protease inhibitors which may reduce adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Moyle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000</LINK>). This is suspected to be as a result of inflammation in the gut, drug molecules attracting fluid into the gut lumen and an overall increased fluid secretion from the gut walls secretary effect (<LINK REF="REF-Jamjian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamjian 2000</LINK>) 
<BR/>

<BR/>In high income countries, the use of ART has reduced the incidence of these opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Anastasi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anastasi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). Diarrhoea remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV/AIDS in low income countries where these drugs are either not readily available or affordable (<LINK REF="REF-Logie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logie 2004</LINK>). Many of the affected people are poor and live in rural areas with ill-equipped primary care centres with limited access to simple drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Krain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krain 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>), so that there is poor access to adequate healthcare and laboratory facilities.<BR/> <BR/>Management of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS requires a step-wise multi-disciplinary approach for aggressive treatment while at the same time decreasing patient discomfort and cost. This ideally involves the use of ART as well as interventions for the specific underlying conditions to improve the length and quality of life. Severe diarrhoea is largely treated by massive fluid replacement, specific antimicrobials for infective diarrhoea confirmed by stool culture and drug sensitivity studies, antidiarrhoeal agents and nutritional support (<LINK REF="REF-DuPont-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuPont 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarino-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 2004</LINK>). The approach to HIV/AIDS related diarrhoea in high income countries aims at investigations and treatments to isolate and eradicate specific infecting organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Walter_x002d_Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter-Smith 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarino-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 2004</LINK>). In sub-Saharan Africa and other resource limited areas, this is often not possible owing to constraints of technology, human resource and funds. Therefore, empirical treatment remains a good option in these areas while technology is advancing. Opinions however vary on the best treatment modalities. In patients with HIV/AIDS and chronic diarrhoea, varying degrees of efficacy has been reported following use of ART (<LINK REF="REF-Foudraine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foudraine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverberg 2004</LINK>), antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Guest-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guest 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kadapu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadapu 2002</LINK>), alternative medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Anastasi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anastasi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1999</LINK>). A recent review highlighted a number of Chinese herbs used to reduce morbidity and mortality in HIV/AIDS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>). Other therapies used include combinations of antibiotics and anti-diarrhoeal agents (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>) and anti-diarrhoeal agents (including antimotility agents, adsorbents, calcium carbonate, octreotide) alone (<LINK REF="REF-Schiller-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiller 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Compean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Compean 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antimotility drugs and adsorbents have been found to be of use in controlling diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Schiller-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiller 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dumitrascu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumitrascu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuain 2004</LINK>) including in people with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2000</LINK>) and diarrhoea caused by ART (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000</LINK>) but should not replace the use of anti infective agents. Antimotility drugs are opioid in action, decreasing bowel activity and increasing tone in the large intestine. This increases fecal transit time allowing absorption of fluid from stool into the gut, thus decreasing stool output (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 2004</LINK>). This action also help retain electrolytes and improve hydration. The commonest opioids used against diarrhoea are synthetic such as loperamide (Imodium®), diphenoxylate (Lomotil®) and an opium alkaloid, codeine (Generic) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). Morphine is also used, more so in terminal cases. Associated adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, respiratory depression and effects on the central nervous system (CNS) such as sedation, anxiety, confusion and tolerance. Diphenoxylate crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) sparingly and so along with codeine are progressively more sedative, addictive and prone to dependence and abuse. Loperamide does not cross the blood brain barrier, therefore the CNS effects are not seen and so it is not subject to abuse. The use of antimotility agents is limited in children (<LINK REF="REF-Armon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 2001</LINK>) and in those with bloody diarrhoea as they may precipitate toxic megacolon in ulcerative colitis or prolong duration of diarrhoea with shigella or salmonella infection (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2004</LINK>). Where this is suspected, they are used in conjunction with antibiotics, especially in adults. Adsorbents (Bismuth Subsalicylate, kaolin/Pectin, Attapulgite, etc) are known to be less effective but more active in acute cases of diarrhoea than antimotilitics (<LINK REF="REF-McQuain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuain 2004</LINK>). They act by adsorbing fluids and compounds and binding potential intestinal toxins to improve stool consistency and eliminate these toxins from the gut. Side effects of adsorbents are rare and may present as dark stools and constipation which are dose dependent.</P>

<P>Assisted by the HIV/AIDS Review Group Trials Search Coordinator, we developed a comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy in an attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press and in progress). Full details of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group methods and the journals hand-searched are published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in the section on Collaborative Review Groups (http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/HIV/frame.html).</P>
<P>We used the RCT search strategy developed by The Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook, in combination with terms specific to antidiarrhoeals. We searched the following electronic databases in January 2006:</P>
<P>(1) Medline (1966-2005) via PubMed using the following strategy:</P>

<B>Selection of trials<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two authors (CN and JO) independently undertook study selection. Full articles of potentially eligible studies were also compared and examined independently by both authors and there were no disagreements on the eligibility or otherwise of the selected study. CN contacted authors of trials for missing information.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality </B>
</P>
<P>Risk of bias was assessed as follows:<BR/>(1) Randomisation<BR/>Selection bias was assessed by the method of generation of allocation sequence and adequacy of allocation concealment, classified 'Yes' if adequate, 'No' if not adequate and 'Unclear' if not well described by the authors in such a way that its adequacy is describable.<BR/>(2) Blinding<BR/>Performance and detection biases were assessed by checking whether participants, investigators or assessors were blinded, classified 'Yes' if adequate, 'No' if not adequate and 'Unclear' if not well described by the authors in such a way that its adequacy is describable.<BR/>(3)Inclusion of all randomised participants.<BR/>Attrition bias was assessed by the adequacy of follow up and intention to treat analysis. Trials with loss to follow of less than 10% were rated as adequate (Yes), inadequate (No) if more than 10% and unclear if not well described by the authors in such a way that its adequacy is describable.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Data collection</B>
</P>
<P>For the included trial, we collected information, with a standard data collection form, regarding location of the study, methods of the study (as per quality assessment checklist), characteristics of the participants (age range, eligibility criteria), and types of interventions and outcomes. CN contacted authors for missing data and information. CN and JO performed data extraction independently and the review mentor (KG) resolved any disagreement.</P>
<P>Dehydration was planned to be assessed as mild, moderate or severe with the following physical signs and symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Adelman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelman 1996</LINK>):<BR/>Mild - alert, normal skin elasticity, normal pulse, thirsty, restlessness.<BR/>Moderate - lethargic, thirsty, slow skin retraction, sunken eyes, rapid and weak pulse, sunken anterior fontanelle, deep and may be rapid respiration.<BR/>Severe - Drowsy, may be unconscious, very slow skin retraction, wrinkled skin, cold clammy extremities, rapid feeble pulse, grossly sunken eyes, absent tears, deep and rapid respiration.</P>
<P>Significant dehydration was to be taken as moderate/severe dehydration. Data was not available to assess dehydration.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>We collected each dichotomous outcome for effect in terms of risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Continuous outcomes were assessed with a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval. We planned to assess for heterogeneity by checking for overlapping of confidence interval in the forest plot, test with Cochrane Q test and I<SUP>2 </SUP>test for possibilities of statistically pooling of the outcomes from different studies as well as conducting a sub-group analysis on the following sub-groups: Age (children and adults), concomitant use of ARVs, protease inhibitor containing and non protease inhibitor containing ART and concomitant use of any other antidiarrhoeal therapy. There were, however, no sufficient studies or data to carry these out.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The initial search (January 2006) identified 113 potentially relevant titles. The review was later expanded to include adsorbents in the interventions with a new search (November 2006) identifying 147 potentially relevant titles. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 2 papers in full text were obtained for consideration of inclusion into the review. One paper (<LINK REF="STD-Compean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Compean 1994</LINK>) was excluded as detailed in the table "characteristics of excluded studies" for not comparing an antimotility agent or an adsorbent with another antimotility agent, an adsorbent, placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>The review identified 1 eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-Ilboudo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ilboudo 1997</LINK>) as detailed in the table "characteristics of included studies".</P>
<P>
<B>Participants<BR/>
</B>The included study was based on treatment of chronic diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS randomised to receive either Attapulgite or placebo. Ninety-one adults aged 18 - 60 years from 6 university hospitals in 5 African French speaking countries were included; 45 participants were assigned to attapulgite and 46 assigned to receive placebo. The duration of the study was not clearly stated in the report. Participants were included if they had AIDS diagnosis by CDC criteria, diarrhoea for at least 7 days (at least 4 loose stools per day) and eligible for at least 7 days of hospitalization.<BR/>Those receiving other therapies which might influence the study drugs (antacids, modifiers of the transit, antisecretory and antibacterial drugs) were excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>Participants were randomised to receive 6g of Attapulgite in 30cl water or matching placebo in 3 divided doses for 5 consecutive days. Oral rehydration was given where necessary, diarrhoeal drugs (not clearly described) were also prescribed.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes<BR/>
</B>This review's primary outcome is resolution of diarrhoea measured as stool frequency, volume and consistency repeatedly. The report of the study was only sufficient to record data for stool frequency and consistency on days 1, 3 and 5; day 5 record was, however, not defined in the protocol but was included so as not to loose valuable data. Stool frequency was defined as the number of participants with frequency less than 3 stools per day while stool consistency was defined as number of participants with formed stool after 5 days of treatment. Of the secondary outcomes, only adverse events were recorded, though without sufficient data to be included for analysis.</P>
<P>The study did not report details of randomization, dates and duration of the trial, source of funding and ethics approvals, details of other treatments given and undesirable effects. Efforts to reach the authors for further information were not successful.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well explained. The risk of bias is therefore unclear.</P>
<P>All randomised participants were included in the analysis as there were no losses to follow-up. There is therefore a low risk of bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>One trial was found assessing the use of an adsorbent for chronic diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS. It included 91 adults (Aged 18 to 60 years), diagnosed with AIDS and experiencing diarrhoea for at least 7 days.</P>
<P>Comparison: Attapulgite versus placebo. </P>
<P>Stool frequency.</P>
<P>The fixed effects summary estimate of the relative risk for stool frequency in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Ilboudo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ilboudo 1997</LINK>) for days 1, 3 and 5 were 0.34 (95% CI 0.01 - 8.15), 1.35 (95% CI 0.51 - 3.62) and 1.74 (95% CI 0.89 - 3.38) respectively. These show no evidence of effectiveness of attapulgite compared with placebo on stool frequency in any of the days. </P>
<P>Stool consistency.</P>
<P>The fixed effects summary estimate of the relative risk for stool frequency in the study (Ilboudo 1997) for days 1, 3 and 5 were 0.34 (95% CI 0.01 - 8.15), 1.35 (95% CI 0.51 - 3.62) and 1.74 (95% CI 0.89 - 3.38) respectively. These show no evidence of effectiveness of attapulgite compared with placebo on stool consistency in any of the days.</P>
<P>Adverse events.</P>
<P>The study reported 5 deaths. There was however no explanation on the follow up period or on which arm of the study they occurred. </P>
<P>The small number of participants used in this study may not be sizeable enough to show evidence of effects.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The lone study included in this review is characterised by some methodological flaws in terms of paucity of information given. There was, however, no demonstrable evidence that the antidiarrhoeal agent studied is superior to placebo in controlling diarrhoea in participants. This may not be surprising because of the small sample of participants used for this study.</P>
<P>Review articles and trials comparing antimotilitics with other anti diarrhoeal agents report varying levels of effectiveness. A randomised controlled trial comparing Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) and a combination of Loperamide and Diphenoxylate in HIV positive individuals showed Octreotide as more effective in reducing bowel movement (mean bowel movement per day= 2.1 versus 7; P&lt;0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Compean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Compean 1994</LINK>). A study comparing Loperamide to Racecadotrin (an enkephalinase inhibitor) showed no difference in mean duration of diarrhoea (13 hours versus 19.5 hours; P=0.23) in individuals who were HIV negative (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2005</LINK>). Loperamide had been demonstrated to be effective in controlling diarrhoea in populations without consideration of their sero-status (<LINK REF="REF-Brawner_x002d_Caluag-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brawner-Caluag 1993</LINK>). This effect may not be as much in HIV positive individuals due to immune-depression, higher severity of diarrhoea and the wasting syndrome associated with HIV/AIDS.</P>
<P>The use of antimotility agents and its recommendations in treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>) for controlling diarrhoea in HIV positive people are a result of extrapolations from studies carried out on HIV negative persons and from expert opinion. Trials assessing the effectiveness of antimotility agents and adsorbents for chronic diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS are necessary. This may be conducted on individuals on ART in resource limited areas with the view that the evidence generated can be used on those not receiving ART pending when they will have access to ART. </P>
<P>This search for evidence will need to be extended to conducting trials and systematic reviews comparing antimotility agents with other antidiarrhoeals, weighing benefits against cost, at least, which will be helpful even when ART becomes universally available.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review highlights the absence of evidence for the use of antimotility agents and adsorbents in controlling diarrhoea in people with HIV/AIDS. The poorly-reported single study included show that Attapulgite (an adsorbent) was not better than placebo in controlling diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients while no trials assessing the use antimotilitic were found. For optimum patient care, these agents can still be used, with greater emphasis placed on adjunct therapies like massive fluid replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Abubakar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abubakar 2007</LINK>). Though their effectiveness have not been validated, other antidiarrhoeals like Octreotides can also be used by clinicians while awaiting the evidence of their effectiveness from further studies and reviews.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials assessing the effectiveness of antimotility agents and adsorbents in controlling chronic diarrhoea in HIV positive individuals in resource limited settings are needed. Since it would be unethical to carry out this study in people with HIV/AIDS without providing treatment for control of the disease, it may fit in a module evaluating adjunct therapies in those on ARVs with chronic diarrhoea. Considerations should also include cost benefit analysis and availability.</P>
<P>To provide for alternative regimens, trials and systematic reviews comparing antimotility agents with other anti diarrhoeals in controlling chronic diarrhoea in HIV positive individuals is also needed, weighing benefit against cost and availability. This will aid practice, especially in resource limited settings, and further improve the quality of life of patients.<BR/> </P>
