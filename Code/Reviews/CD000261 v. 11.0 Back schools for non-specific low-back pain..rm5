<P>There is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools are more effective for pain and function than other conservative treatments if the patients with chronic low-back pain (LBP) are from the general public, primary or secondary care.

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Since the introduction of the Swedish back school in 1969, back schools have frequently been used for treating patients with low-back pain (LBP). However, the content of back schools has changed and appears to vary widely today. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of back schools for patients with non-specific LBP.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to May 2003 for relevant trials reported in English, Dutch, French or German. We also screened references from relevant reviews and included trials. The literature search has now been updated to November 2004. No additional trials were identified.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on any type of back school for non-specific LBP were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Four reviewer authors, blinded to authors, institution and journal, independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the trials. We set the high quality level, a priori, at a trial meeting six or more of 11 internal validity criteria. As data were clinically and statistically too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, we used a qualitative review (best evidence synthesis) to summarize the results. The evidence was classified into four levels (strong, moderate, limited or no evidence), taking into account the methodological quality of the studies. We also evaluated the clinical relevance of the studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nineteen RCTs (3584 patients) were included in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality was low, with only six trials considered to be high quality. It was not possible to perform relevant subgroup analyses for LBP with radiation versus LBP without radiation. The results indicate that there is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools have better short and intermediate-term effects on pain and functional status than other treatments for patients with recurrent and chronic LBP. There is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools for chronic LBP in an occupational setting, are more effective than other treatments and placebo or waiting list controls on pain, functional status and return to work during short and intermediate-term follow-up. In general, the clinical relevance of the studies was rated as insufficient.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools, in an occupational setting, reduce pain, and improve function and return-to-work status, in the short and intermediate-term, compared to exercises, manipulation, myofascial therapy, advice, placebo or waiting list controls, for patients with chronic and recurrent LBP. However, future trials should improve methodological quality and clinical relevance and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of back schools. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain (LBP) related disability and work absence accounts for high economical costs in western societies (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1999</LINK>). Direct and indirect costs in the United States (US) were estimated to be more than US $50 billion per year (<LINK REF="REF-Frymoyer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frymoyer 1993</LINK>). Estimates of direct and indirect costs in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1998 were US $11 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>). Estimates of the financial burden of LBP in the Netherlands in 1991 indicated that the total costs were almost US $5 billion (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1995</LINK>). Although LBP rarely indicates a serious underlying disorder, patients with LBP that lasts for longer than one or two months have an elevated risk of developing longer-term disability and repeated care-seeking (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1987</LINK>). Moreover, the recovery process of patients with chronic LBP is slow, and their demands on the health care system are both large and costly. To date, many therapeutic interventions have been performed and studied for the treatment of LBP, however, no single treatment has proven to be obviously superior compared to any other (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997b</LINK>). Consequently, there are discrepancies between countries in the various clinical guidelines and therapeutic recommendations for patients with LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staal 2003</LINK>). Continuously and systematically summarising the literature provides the best evidence for the treatment of (sub-groups of) patients with LBP. In this systematic review, we will present the results on the effectiveness of back schools for non-specific LBP.</P>
<P>The original 'Swedish back school' was introduced by Zachrisson-Forsell in 1969. It was intended to reduce the pain and prevent recurrences of episodes of LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Zachrisson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachrisson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachrisson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachrisson 1981</LINK>). The back school consisted of information on the anatomy of the back, biomechanics, optimal posture, ergonomics and back exercises. Four small group sessions were scheduled during a two-week period, each session lasting 45 minutes. Since the introduction of the Swedish back school, the content and length of back schools has changed and appears to vary widely today.</P>
<P>This review is an update of a previously conducted Cochrane review of RCTs on the effectiveness of back schools (van Tulder 1999; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999</LINK>) and two systematic reviews on back schools and group education interventions for LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 1994</LINK>). In these reviews, it was not possible to statistically pool the studies because of the large data deficiencies and heterogeneity in trial designs. Conclusions were generated on the basis of the methodological quality scores of the studies, assessed using a generally accepted criteria list, in combination with a best evidence synthesis. It was indicated that modifications of the Swedish back school, offering quite an intensive program in an occupational setting, seemed to be the most effective type of back school. However, evidence for the cost-effectiveness of back schools was lacking. Since 1998, five new RCTs have been conducted that evaluated the effectiveness of back schools. In addition, method guidelines for systematic reviews in the field of back pain were recently published that contained new recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine if back schools were more effective than other treatments or no treatment for patients with non-specific LBP.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 14:18:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Non-randomized trials were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that included subjects with non-specific LBP, aged 18 to 70 years, were included. Low-back pain was defined as pain localised below the scapulae and above the cleft of the buttocks; non-specific indicated that no specific cause was detectable, such as, infection, neoplasm, metastasis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fracture, or inflammatory process.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Randomized controlled trials in which one of the treatments consisted of a back school type of intervention were included. A back school was defined as consisting of an educational and skills acquisition program, including exercises, in which all lessons were given to groups of patients and supervised by a paramedical therapist or medical specialist. Additional interventions were allowed. However, if the back school was part of a larger multi-disciplinary treatment program, the study was only included if a contrast existed for the back school. For example, a study comparing a fitness program with a back school plus fitness program was included, but a study comparing a back school plus fitness program with a waiting list control group (WLC) not.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that measured at least one of the four primary outcome measures that are considered to be the most important for back pain, that is, return to work (return to work status, days off work), pain (VAS), a global measure of improvement (overall improvement, proportion of patients recovered, subjective improvement of symptoms), and functional status (expressed on a back-specific index, such as the Roland Disability Questionnaire or the Oswestry Scale) were included (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1998</LINK>). Physiological outcomes of physical examination, such as, range of motion, spinal flexibility, degrees of straight leg raising or muscle strength were considered secondary outcomes, because these outcome measures may correlate poorly with the clinical status of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1988</LINK>). Other symptoms such as medication use and side effects were also considered.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 14:18:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs published in English, Dutch, French and German were included. The highly sensitive literature searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE were based on the search strategies recommended and updated by the Editorial Board of the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>. The following search strategy was conducted for the original review. Randomized controlled trials were identified by:<BR/>(A) a computer-aided search of the MEDLINE (from 1966-1997) and EMBASE (from 1988-1997) databases;<BR/>(B) screening references given in relevant reviews and included RCTs;<BR/>(C) screening CENTRAL, The Cochrane library 1998, Issue 4, using the search terms 'back pain' and 'low back pain'.</P>
<P>For the updated review, the same searches were conducted in the same databases for the period January 1998 to May 2003, and The Cochrane Library 2003, Issue 2 was used to identify new studies. The literature search has now been updated to November 2004. No additional trials were identified.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-19 14:10:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2003 update, two authors (MH, MvT) independently selected new studies, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data (using a standardized form). This was conducted in the same way, described in the following sections, as in the previously published systematic review .</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently selected the trials to be included in the systematic review according to the complete search strategy; i.e., they ran the search strategy and selected the RCTs. A consensus method was used to solve disagreements about the selection of RCTs, and a third author was consulted if disagreement persisted. The study selection was completed in two steps. In Step 1, the two authors first screened the titles, abstracts and keywords of all references identified by the literature search to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. In Step 2, the full text was retrieved for studies for which the inclusion decision could not be made by screening in Step 1, and reviewed against the inclusion criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of the RCTs was independently assessed by two authors. A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements and a third author was consulted if disagreements persisted. If the article did not contain information on (one or more of) the methodological criteria (score 'unclear'), the authors were contacted for additional information. We anticipated that authors might work at other places than listed in the publications. We, therefore, tried to locate their current working address through their last publication in MEDLINE or through the Internet. If we could not find a more recent working address, we sent the request for information to the address listed on the paper used in our review. If the authors could not be contacted or if the information was no longer available, the criteria was scored as 'unclear'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently scored the clinical relevance of the included studies according to five questions recommended by the Cochrane Collaborative Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) . Each question was scored positive (+) if the clinical relevance item was fulfilled, negative (-) if the item was not fulfilled and unclear (?) if data were not available. The five questions are:<BR/>1. Are the patients described in detail so that you can decide whether they are comparable to those that you see in your practice?<BR/>2. Are the interventions and treatment settings described well enough so that you can provide the same for your patients?<BR/>3. Were all clinically relevant outcomes measured and reported?<BR/>4. Is the size of the effect clinically important?<BR/>5. Are the likely treatment benefits worth the potential harms?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data (using a standardized form) on the four types of outcomes: a) pain intensity: expressed on a visual analog (VAS) or similar scale, b) overall improvement: proportion of patients recovered or improved, c) functional status: expressed on a back-pain specific scale (e.g., Roland Disability Questionnaire), Oswestry Questionnaire) or a generic scale (e.g., Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)), d) return to work: number of days of sick leave or proportion of patients returned to work.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>The results of each RCT were plotted as point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical homogeneity was formally tested and the clinical homogeneity was evaluated by exploring the differences between the RCTs, taking into consideration the study population, types of back schools and reference treatments, timing of follow-up measurements and outcomes and measurement instruments. On the basis of these evaluations, attempts were made to statistically pool the data for the outcome measures pain, functional status and return to work, for the comparisons back school versus other treatments and back school versus WLC or placebo. These attempts were made for short, intermediate and long-term follow-up. As the 'Results' section will show, many studies did not report their results in a way that enabled us to perform statistical pooling (for example, for continuous data, means were presented but no standard deviations). Consequently, for most comparisons, only a limited number of studies was available for statistical pooling. Furthermore, studies were heterogeneous with respect to study populations, interventions and settings. Therefore, we did not perform a meta-analysis, but summarized the results using a rating system with four levels of evidence (best evidence synthesis), based on the quality and the outcome of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Strong evidence</B> - provided by generally consistent findings in multiple high quality RCTs;</LI>
<LI>
<B>Moderate evidence </B>- provided by generally consistent findings in one high quality RCT plus one or more low quality RCTs, or by generally consistent findings in multiple low quality RCTs;</LI>
<LI>
<B>Limited or conflicting evidence</B> - only one RCT (either high or low quality) or inconsistent findings in multiple RCTs;</LI>
<LI>
<B>No evidence</B> - no RCTs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We defined high quality studies as RCTs that fulfilled six or more of the internal validity criteria. We also performed sensitivity analyses, exploring the results, when high quality was defined as fulfilling five or more or seven or more, or if high quality was defined as having adequate concealment of treatment allocation.</P>
<P>Analyses were conducted separately for a) (sub)acute LBP (lasting 12 weeks or less) and chronic LBP (lasting longer than 12 weeks) and b) back schools in an occupational setting. It was not possible to make relevant subgroup analyses for LBP with radiation versus LBP without radiation. Randomised controlled trials that included a mixed population of patients with LBP were scored for clinical relevance, but were excluded from the analysis. A study was defined as being conducted in an occupational setting when the study population consisted of a working population or workers on sick leave.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Our original 1998 literature search resulted in the identification of 47 references from MEDLINE and 252 from EMBASE. However, 28 references were included in both MEDLINE and EMBASE, leaving a total of 271. The first selection, based on titles, keywords and abstracts, resulted in 27 disagreements between the two authors. After discussing these disagreements, the authors decided to include two, exclude 15 abstracts, and they were not sure about inclusion of 10 abstracts. After consensus, the final results of the first step in study selection were that both authors agreed that 14 abstracts met the inclusion criteria, 23 were rated as 'not sure' and 234 were excluded. Copies of the full papers of the 23 abstracts rated 'not sure' were subsequently assessed, resulting in the inclusion of an additional seven papers. Consequently, a total of 21 papers met our selection criteria. However, four papers reported on one trial (Härkäpää1989, Mellin 1998; Härkäpää 1990; Mellin 1990), and three, on another (Julkunen 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Hurri-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hurri 1989</LINK>, Hurri 1989b), leaving a total of 14 trials that were included in the previous Cochrane review.</P>
<P>The 2003 update of the literature searches resulted in the identification of 25 references from MEDLINE and 35 from EMBASE. A total of 22 references were included in both MEDLINE and EMBASE, resulting in 38 references that met our inclusion criteria. After the selection and discussion step based on the titles, keywords and abstracts, both authors agreed that eight papers met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 1999</LINK>; Dalichau 1998; <LINK REF="STD-Penttinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Penttinen 2002</LINK>, Glomsrød 2001; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; Indahl 1998). Of these eight papers, two papers by Dalichau (Dalichau 1998; <LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 1999</LINK>) reported on the same study, as did the papers by <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK> and Glomsrød 2001, and two papers by Indahl (<LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; Indahl 1998), leaving five eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penttinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Penttinen 2002</LINK>) that could be included in the updated review. Consequently, a total of 19 studies were included.</P>
<P>Six studies were excluded because they either did not meet our inclusion criteria for this review or had fatal errors in their design (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stankovic-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stankovic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frost-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frost 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mucha-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mucha 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roques-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roques 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molde-Hagen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Molde Hagen 2003</LINK>). We excluded the study by Stankovic (<LINK REF="STD-Stankovic-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stankovic 1990</LINK>) that was included in the original Cochrane review. This study included a "Mini Back School", consisting of only one 45-minute session, with back care education as control group. The back school did not include exercises and, therefore, did not meet our definition of a back school. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Molde-Hagen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Molde Hagen 2003</LINK>, a modified version of a mini back school was applied to individuals instead of groups of patients. The study by Frost (<LINK REF="STD-Frost-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frost 1995</LINK>) did not use an appropriate contrast for the back school. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 1988</LINK>, each group was assessed only once, the control group at the beginning of the program and the back school group at the end. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mucha-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mucha 1996</LINK>, the study population was randomized into a back school and control group, but the differences between these groups were not analysed. Instead, the authors only presented data for the back school group. In the feasibility study by <LINK REF="STD-Roques-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roques 2002</LINK>, not all patients were randomly allocated to treatment and consequently this study did not meet the criteria of an RCT.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>For the assessment of the methodological quality of the trials, we combined the information from all papers reporting on the same trial. The methodological quality of the 19 trials is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Initially, there was disagreement between the authors on 58 (28%) of the 209 items scored. Most disagreements were resolved in discussion. The third author only had to make a final decision once. We sent the results of our quality assessment to the (first) authors of the RCTs, asking them if they agreed with our score, and, if not, to state the reasons. We also asked them for additional information if our final score was 'unclear'. Ten authors responded to our request (<LINK REF="STD-Donchin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Donchin 1990</LINK>; Härkäpää1989, <LINK REF="STD-Hurri-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hurri 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lankhorst-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lankhorst 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindequist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lindequist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>). The final scores, based on the comments and additional information of the authors of the studies are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. One author agreed with our score and nine provided additional information. We changed 26 scores, 11 from unclear to positive, nine from unclear to negative, and six from negative to positive. Only six studies had six or more positive scores (<LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>). The most prevalent methodological shortcomings appeared to be Items 4 and 9, i.e., in none of the RCTs were the patients or care providers blinded. Other methodological flaws that occurred in more than half of the studies were: an inappropriate method of randomization (item 1a), no concealment of treatment allocation (item 1b), no measures taken in the study design to avoid co-interventions (item 3), no blinding of observers (item 5), and either no satisfactory compliance of interventions or no measurement of compliance at all (item 10).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical pooling</HEADING>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that provide sufficient and similar information on study setting, reference group, study population and LBP characteristics are required for statistical pooling, as proposed in the 'Method' section. Of the 19 RCTs, five studies did not provide any usable information, because outcome measures like spinal mobility or the SIP were sometimes used, or they lacked necessary data (<LINK REF="STD-Berwick-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berwick 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donchin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Donchin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keijsers-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Keijsers 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindequist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lindequist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1988</LINK>). Furthermore, six of the remaining 14 RCTs could not be included in the statistical pooling, because sensible subgroups could not be produced. Three of these studies included acute and subacute patients, but used different reference groups. Three studies included patients with a mix of acute and chronic LBP. Consequently, eight RCTs that included chronic LBP patients with or without radiation were available for statistical pooling. With respect to the timing and presence of outcome measurements of these eight RCTs, we initially tried to pool the data for the subgroups described below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We defined high quality as meeting six of the 11 internal validity criteria. A sensitivity analysis was carried out using different cut-off points, i.e., high quality defined as either five or seven of the 11 items scored positive. Only one study met seven or more of the criteria out of 11 (<LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>), and nine studies met at least five of the 11 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donchin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Donchin 1990</LINK>; Härkäpää1989; <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>). If high quality was defined that seven or more items had to meet our criteria, the strength of the evidence would remain the same. If high quality was defined as five or more items meeting our criteria, there would be strong evidence that back schools were more effective than other treatments for chronic back pain at short-term follow-up, and strong evidence that there was no difference in long-term follow-up for the same comparison. Furthermore, there would be strong evidence for the effectiveness of back schools compared to waiting list control or placebo for patients with chronic back pain. Changing the high quality level to meeting five or more items would not contaminate the conclusions with respect to the strength of evidence for back schools in an occupational setting. If we related high quality to an adequate concealment of treatment allocation, which could be identified in three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Donchin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Donchin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>) the strength of the evidence did not change.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>The clinical relevance of the studies was assessed independently by two authors, by scoring the five questions presented in the methods section. See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for the scores. Disagreement between the two authors existed on 32 (34%) of the 95 clinical relevance scores. Overall, none of the clinical relevance scores of the RCTs were sufficient. None of the RCTs scored a positive on all clinical relevance items, and only four RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 1996</LINK>) scored positively on four of the five questions. The most negative scores were assigned to the questions about the description of the interventions and treatment settings and the clinical importance of the effect size. Furthermore, the majority of studies scored unclear for the question regarding the likely treatment benefits, indicating a clear lack of information on this topic.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In this review update, nineteen RCTs were included that evaluated the effectiveness of back schools for non-specific LBP. Positive short-term effects of back schools were seen in most of the RCTs. Positive long-term effects of back schools were only reported in four RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penttinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Penttinen 2002</LINK>). Of particular note was the heterogeneity among studies with respect to study populations, content of back schools, type of control interventions and outcome measurements. Studies also differed in cultural setting, with most studies conducted in Scandinavia. This means, that with respect to the generalizability of the results, cultural differences in healthcare and social security systems have to be considered. We qualitatively assessed the strength of evidence of the included RCTs by applying a methodological criteria list and best evidence synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999</LINK>). Because of the divergence in study designs and the generally low methodological quality scores of the RCTs, it was not possible to perform statistical pooling of the data. According to the best evidence synthesis, we could not identify strong evidence for any type of back school treatment. We concluded that there is moderate evidence that back schools have better short and intermediate-term effects than other treatments for recurrent and chronic LBP for pain and functional status. Furthermore, there is moderate evidence that back schools in an occupational setting are more effective than other treatments, placebo or waiting list controls for chronic LBP for pain, functional status and return to work during short and intermediate-term follow-up. The clinical relevance of the RCTs, scored by answering five questions, was insufficient.</P>
<P>The generally low methodological quality scores of the included RCTs, originating from the many shortcomings in trial design and performance, was striking. After weighing the methodological quality of the studies, six RCTs could be identified as being of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Indahl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Indahl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>), leaving 13 RCTs of low methodological quality. Compared to the cut-off value of meeting at least six criteria to be considered high quality, the mean total quality score of the 19 included RCTs was 3.8, which is a low score. The most commonly identified methodological deficiencies were the lack of blinding of patients (scored negative in all 19 RCTs), observers and care providers (scored negative in all 19 RCTs), an inappropriate method of randomization (scored negative or unclear in 13 RCTs), inadequate concealment of treatment allocation (scored negative or unclear in 16 RCTs), lack of avoidance of co-interventions (scored negative or unclear in 16 RCTs), and unsatisfactory compliance with the interventions (scored negative or unclear in 16 RCTs). Empirical evidence reports an existing association between inadequate concealment of treatment allocation and lack of double-blinding (blinding of patients and observers) with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>). In only six out of nineteen RCTs a clear description of the randomization procedure was available (<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00f8_nn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lønn 1999</LINK>). More disappointing, was that in only three out of 19 studies was there a clear description of the treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Donchin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Donchin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Linton 1989</LINK>). The reported methodological limitations are not unique for clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of back schools, but have also been demonstrated in trials on other conservative treatments for LBP. However, reports of RCTs should be accurate and complete so that readers can evaluate the internal and external validity of the trial. In this review, we changed 24 quality assessment scores after additional information was provided by eight authors, which indicates that the quality of the report is not similar to the quality of the trial. Contacting the authors for additional information is only one solution to this problem and has the disadvantage that it may be difficult to contact authors of trials that have been published for several years. The quality of future RCTs in the field of back pain should be improved to reduce bias in systematic reviews, as it has been demonstrated that statistical pooling of low quality trials results in overestimation of treatment effects. </P>
<P>For clinicians and other caregivers, it is essential not only to be informed about the effectiveness of back schools, but also about the characteristics of the included patients, clinical relevance of the effect size, and content of the programs, to determine the clinical relevance of the studies for their patient population. In this review, we assessed the clinical relevance of the RCTs by scoring five questions recently recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) and published earlier by <LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1994</LINK>. The majority of RCTs did not score sufficiently on the questions, especially Questions 2 and 4, which described the intervention and treatment settings and the clinically relevant effect size. RCTs either reported briefly about the content of the intervention or failed to report essential information about the type, intensity or performance of the exercises. Also apparent were the widely variations in the content and components of the interventions. This may explain the differences in interpretation of the items between the two authors, reflected by the disagreement score of 34%. It is recommended that future RCTs explicitly describe clinically relevant aspects of intervention programs, alongside the development of stricter criteria to validly judge the clinical relevance. This information is important to eventually identify which element of a back school program is responsible for changes in outcome for a specific type of LBP patient, to improve clinical care (<LINK REF="REF-Staal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannion-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannion 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>As the effect of back schools is likely to be small, a meta-analysis in which information from multiple RCTs is combined could provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness of back schools. In this systematic review, we tried to perform a formal meta-analysis of the data studied. However, most of the studies reported insufficient information about means, standard deviations or group size, with the result that a quantitative summary of the data was impossible. Furthermore, it is not yet commonly accepted for RCTs in LBP research to measure the four recommended outcome measures of pain, functional status, improvement and return to work. The majority of included studies in this review reported information on pain, namely 16 out of the 19 included RCTs. However, a limited number of studies reported on functional status and return to work; only seven and four out of the 19 studies, respectively. Recently, several attempts were made to recommend and standardise the use of these outcome measures for LBP research (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1998</LINK>). Hopefully, this will enhance the comparability of future RCTs, which will result in more sensible subgroup analyses. </P>
<P>Several biases can be introduced by the literature search and selection procedure. We might have missed relevant unpublished trials, which are more likely to be small studies with non-significant or negative results, leading to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>). Screening references of identified trials and systematic reviews may result in an overrepresentation of positive studies in the review, because trials with a positive result are more likely to be referred to in other publications, leading to reference bias (<LINK REF="REF-Goetzsche-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetzsche 1987</LINK>). We tried to identify RCTs published in English, Dutch, French and German, but English trials most often met our inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Two RCTs of back schools were identified that were published in German, one low quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 1999</LINK>) and another excluded study, because the analyses were only presented for the back school group (<LINK REF="STD-Mucha-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mucha 1996</LINK>). It has been demonstrated in fields other than back pain, that among published studies, those with significant results are more likely to get published in English, leading to language bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Because one of the main principles of a systematic review is to include all available evidence, identification of all trials is important to the validity of a systematic review. Biases such as publication, reference or language bias can be avoided by the use of prospective registries of trials. However, the final decision to include, for example, unpublished trials or trials published in languages other than English, may be based on practical reasons rather than methodological ones.</P>
<P>At present, cost-effectiveness analyses of back schools have not been conducted alongside RCTs. Two non-randomized trials on cost-effectiveness did not show any significant differences between back schools and no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Versloot-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Versloot 1992</LINK>). The length of back schools included in this review varied from a Swedish back school containing four 45-minute sessions to more intensive back schools with a three to five-week stay in a specialized centre. These more intensive back schools are likely to be more expensive. If back schools of different intensity are similarly effective, the next step should be to gain insight into the cost-effectiveness of these different type of back schools. Correctly, <LINK REF="REF-Goossens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossens 1997</LINK> concluded in their publication of a review of economic evaluations of all kinds of interventions for back pain, that there is a need for improvement of the methodological quality of the cost-effectiveness studies.</P>
<P>Review articles offer clinicians and health policy makers the opportunity to cope with the exponentially increasing number of medical publications like RCTs. Conclusions originating from systematic reviews contribute largely to the development and implementation of practical LBP guidelines to enhance clinical care. For a long time, clinicians have been provided with evidence from non-systematic narrative reviews. The current interest in evidence-based medicine has led to an extensive increase in the publication of systematic summaries of RCTs. Randomized controlled trials are generally considered to be the paradigm of intervention research, that is, the strongest scientific proof of the effectiveness of an intervention. Recently, recommendations for the reporting of RCTs, the CONSORT statement, were published, which have been adopted by several leading medical journals and included in their instructions to authors (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Although systematic reviews of RCTs have their limitations, there seems to be consensus that there is a need for them, and that they need to be conducted as carefully as the studies they report (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>). The recent development and publication of methodical guidelines for systematic reviews of RCTs in the field of LBP offers guidance to researchers preparing, conducting or reporting a systematic review and to readers evaluating these reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997a</LINK>). It is still not possible to give a definite answer on the question on whether back schools are an effective treatment for (subgroups of) LBP patients. Prospective improvement in the quality of reporting of RCTs seems to be the best option to reduce bias in future systematic reviews and to lead to strong levels of evidence.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is moderate evidence that back schools conducted in occupational settings seem to be more effective for patients with recurrent and chronic LBP (as opposed to patients from the general population or primary/secondary care) than other treatments, placebo or waiting list controls for pain, functional status and return to work during short and intermediate-term follow-up. The most promising interventions consisted of a modification of the Swedish back school and were quite intensive (a three to five-week stay in a specialized centre).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To conclude, we identified 19 RCTs (3584 patients) that evaluated the effectiveness of back schools. Most of the studies included in this review showed methodological deficiencies. Clearly, there is a need for future high quality RCTs to determine which type of back school is the most effective for LBP patients. Furthermore, future RCTs should include an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of back schools and consider the clinical relevance of the trial more during study design and performance. </P>

<P>1a) method of randomization - a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer generated random number table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>1b) concealment of treatment allocation - assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients; this person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.<BR/>
<BR/>2) withdrawal/drop-out rate - the number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias, a yes is scored. (N.B., these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature).<BR/>
<BR/>3) co-interventions avoided or equal - Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or comparable between the index and control groups.<BR/>
<BR/>4) blinding of patients - The reviewer determines if there was enough information about the blinding of the patient to score a yes. As it is difficult to blind the patients for a back school program, we considered the blinding also adequate if an attempt was made to blind the patients or if the credibility of the treatments was evaluated and treatments were equally credible and acceptable to patients.<BR/>
<BR/>5) blinding of observer - The reviewer determines if there was enough information about the blinding of the outcome assessor to score a yes. <BR/>
<BR/>6) intention-to-treat analysis - All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>7) similarity of baseline characteristics - In order to receive a yes, groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms and value of main outcome measure(s).<BR/>
<BR/>8) adequate length of follow-up - scored positive if an effect measurement is included after 12 months or more<BR/>
<BR/>9) blinding of care provider - The reviewer determines if there was enough information about the blinding of the care provider to score a yes. As it is probably impossible to blind care providers to whether or not they were giving a back school intervention, this item did not apply here.<BR/>
<BR/>10) compliance - The reviewer determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number, and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention(s) and control intervention(s).</P>

<TITLE>concerns about term 'non-specific LBP'</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>- January 2003<BR/>The concept of "non-specific low back pain" is, I believe, to be a non-entity. I wrote an Article about this in the Archives of Internal Medicine in July, 2002.</P>
<P>Use of this term has a great impact on how we look at low back pain, acute or chronic. I suggest you review this. Either dispense with this term, or defend it. </P>
<P>Thank you for your consideration.</P>
<P>I have an affiliation for subsidy of courses on low back pain from the Purdue-Fredericks CO. which has an interest in the the use of its opioids for low back pain, other non-malignant pain and for malignant pain.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for taking the time to comment on one of our Cochrane reviews. The aim of the Cochrane Back Review Group is to collate and make available the scientific (at present RCT) evidence on the effectiveness of therapies for the management for low back pain, it is not to try to answer every question about back pain. Issues such as nomenclature and classification are outside of our mandate and more appropriately debated in other forum such as Arch Intern Med. The Cochrane Review - quite properly - simply adheres to generally accepted usage at this time.</P>

<TITLE>concern arising from title/scope of review</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>July 2006 - I feel the review should be renamed back schools for the treatment of low-back pain. There is at least one reasonble quality back school RCT that aimed to prevent low back and that is not included in this review: Daltroy NEJM 1997;337:222-8. Or with the next update the review could be extended to include also prevention trials.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for having the interest and taking the time to read and offer comments on our review. As I'm sure you know, the basic Cochrane format for titles implies that the intervention is for the treatment of a disease or disorder &#8211; i.e. [intervention] FOR [health problem]. However, there is nothing precluding the title from stating [intervention] FOR [preventing health problem], if, in fact, the review is about prevention.</P>
<P>This brings me to the other part of your comment &#8211; the possibility of expanding the scope of the review and including trials on prevention in the next update. I will certainly suggest this to the contact author. Alternately, if I have a request from potential authors for topics for a review before Dr Heymans updates the review, I will offer Back Schools for the prevention of low-back pain as an option.</P>
<P>Thank you for the opportunity to explore these options.</P>
