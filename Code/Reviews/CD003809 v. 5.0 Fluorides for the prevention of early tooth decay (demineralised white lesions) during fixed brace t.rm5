<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:33:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Ugly white marks sometimes appear on the teeth during orthodontic (brace) treatment. These are caused by early tooth decay and usually occur with fixed (or glued-on 'train track') braces when the teeth are not cleaned properly.</P>
<P>We know that fluoride in toothpaste helps to prevent dental decay; therefore, extra fluoride provided to people wearing braces should protect them from these marks. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines the evidence for this in existing research. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of fluorides in preventing early tooth decay during orthodontic (brace) treatment and to determine the best way to do this.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Early tooth decay around the brackets that attach braces to the teeth can cause white or brown marks (demineralised white lesions (DWLs)) to appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment. Build-up of dental plaque around these brackets is associated with increased risk of rapid demineralisation of the enamel of teeth. Demineralisation is an early, but reversible, stage in the development of tooth decay. Wearing of fixed braces may be associated with pain, and both the brace and the pain make toothbrushing more difficult, which in turn means that it is harder to prevent the build-up of plaque. People often wear braces for 18 months or longer, and there is a risk that tooth decay will damage the teeth, requiring restorations and fillings to be done.</P>
<P>Fluoride is effective in reducing tooth decay in people who are at risk of developing it. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. It is important to consider how the fluoride is to be applied and whether children and adolescents (receiving fixed brace treatment) are likely to be willing and able to regularly apply by themselves the amounts needed to prevent early tooth decay.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was up-to-date as of 31 January 2013. Three studies with 458 participants were included in this updated review. Participants were undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed braces, and DWLs were assessed on teeth remaining in the mouth at the end of orthodontic treatment.</P>
<P>The different ways of applying fluoride that were assessed included:</P>
<P>1. topical fluorides, for example, fluoride-containing varnish, mouthrinse, gel or toothpaste;<BR/>2. fluoride-releasing devices attached to the braces; and<BR/>3. control group approaches - individuals did not receive additional fluoride as described, or they received a placebo or a different form of fluoride.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>One study showed that when the dentist paints fluoride-containing varnish around the teeth and brace every time it is adjusted, the risk of developing white marks is reduced by nearly 70%; however, further well-designed trials are required to confirm this finding.</P>
<P>The rest of the evidence is weak, and more studies are needed to show the best way of delivering extra fluoride to people wearing braces. Adverse effects or harms of interventions were not reported in any of the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence found is moderate in the case of one well-designed study and weak in the remaining studies. Recommendations state that further well-conducted research should be conducted in this area.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:01:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>Demineralised white lesions (DWLs) can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brackets that attach the braces to the teeth. Fluoride is effective in reducing decay in susceptible individuals in the general population. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. This review compares the effects of various forms of fluoride used during orthodontic treatment on the development of DWLs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:01:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of fluoride delivery in reducing the incidence of DWLs, as well as the size of lesions. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DWLs, and oral health&#8211;related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:02:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 31 January 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 January 2013); and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 January 2013).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:03:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>We included trials if they met the following criteria: (1) parallel-group randomised clinical trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which (2) the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:19:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:23:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study.</P>
<P>Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review. One study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains, in one study the risk of bias was unclear and in the remaining study, the risk of bias was high.</P>
<P>One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value &lt; 0.001). This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants.</P>
<P>One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index.</P>
<P>One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured.</P>
<P>Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:26:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>This review found some moderate evidence that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks at the time of orthodontic review during treatment is effective, but this finding is based on a single study. Further adequately powered, double-blind, randomised controlled trials are required to determine the best means of preventing DWLs in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment and the most accurate means of assessing compliance with treatment and possible adverse effects. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DWLs on participant satisfaction with treatment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:39:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:36:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, brackets are attached to the teeth to hold the wires that provide the forces required to straighten the teeth. One of the adverse effects of fixed braces is that dental plaque collects around the attachments, leading to accumulation of the types of bacteria that cause dental disease (<LINK REF="REF-Naranjo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naranjo 2006</LINK>). Build-up of dental plaque around orthodontic brackets is associated with increased risk of demineralised white lesions (DWLs), which can be visible within six months (<LINK REF="REF-Tufekci-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tufekci 2011</LINK>). Demineralisation is an early, but reversible, stage in the development of dental decay (caries). Cariogenic bacteria present in the dental plaque transform sugar in the diet into organic acids, which start to damage the tooth enamel. Effective removal of plaque will prevent DWLs from occurring; however, the presence of orthodontic appliances in the mouth and associated dental pain may make it more difficult for individuals to adequately clean their teeth and braces. DWLs developing on the buccal surfaces of teeth during orthodontic treatment can become a significant problem over the course of treatment, which may last for 18 months or longer, resulting in a poor appearance of the teeth following straightening (<LINK REF="REF-Maxfield-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxfield 2012</LINK>). In severe cases, caries can develop, requiring restoration (filling); this may be both painful and costly.</P>
<P>A recent study by Enaia and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Enaia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enaia 2011</LINK>) using clinical photographs of the teeth taken before and after fixed brace treatment found that the prevalence of DWLs was 32% in participants before treatment; however, this proportion rose to 74% after treatment. Most of the DWLs were minor, but a significant minority of participants (10%) had cavities in their teeth, which may have required a filling. Although DWLs tend to fade with time as they heal, <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1989</LINK> found that, even five years after treatment, orthodontic participants had a significantly higher incidence of DWLs than a control group of participants who did not undergo orthodontic treatment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:37:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Orthodontists are keen to prevent the development of DWLs so their patients may have the best possible outcome following orthodontic treatment - well-aligned caries-free teeth. Fluoride is important in the prevention of dental decay (<LINK REF="REF-ten-Cate-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Cate 2013</LINK>). Marinho and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>) found a definite reduction in caries in children and adolescents who performed regular supervised rinsing with a fluoride mouthwash. It has also been shown that fluoride may reduce the number of DWLs that develop during brace treatment. When orthodontic participants used a mouthrinse, Geiger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Geiger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Geiger 1992</LINK>) found a 30% reduction in the number of participants and a 25% reduction in the incidence of teeth affected by DWLs. Many orthodontists recommend the use of a daily fluoride mouthrinse throughout brace treatment to prevent DWLs (<LINK REF="REF-Kerbusch-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerbusch 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several methods (in addition to fluoridated toothpaste) are used to deliver fluoride to teeth in patients during orthodontic treatment. These include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Topical fluorides (e.g. mouthrinse, gel, varnish).</LI>
<LI>Fluoride-releasing materials (e.g. glues used to bond the brackets onto the teeth and orthodontic elastics that are impregnated with fluoride).</LI>
<LI>Dietary fluoride supplementation (e.g. fluoridated milk).</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:38:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluoride present in the mouth reduces caries development via three mechanisms: inhibition of the demineralisation of dental enamel, enhancement of the remineralisation of dental enamel producing a remineralised layer that is resistant to acid attack and inhibition of the bacterial enzymes that produce the acid (<LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ten-Cate-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Cate 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most children undergoing orthodontic treatment will be exposed to some fluoride - low concentrations in the water supply, higher concentrations from fluoridated dentifrices (toothpaste), or both. Use of additional topical fluorides and/or fluoride sources designed to deliver additional fluoride to the at-risk area near orthodontic brackets are likely to reduce the risk of DWL development. Topical fluorides include fluoride mouthrinses, varnishes, gels, dentifrices and dietary sources (e.g. fluoridated milk). Specific orthodontic sources of fluoride include bracket adhesives and orthodontic elastic bands (elastomeric ligatures), which slowly release fluoride into the mouth. All of these fluoride sources release fluoride into saliva that is distributed throughout the mouth.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:39:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several systematic reviews have investigated the effects of delivering fluoride in various modes on dental caries in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2004</LINK>); however, these systematic reviews did not examine the effects of fluoride on participants wearing fixed orthodontic braces.</P>
<P>Some orthodontists routinely recommend to their patients the use of fluoride mouthrinses. However, clear evidence is lacking regarding the optimum concentration of fluoride in mouthrinses, the optimum frequency of mouthrinse use and the effects of mouthrinses and other topical fluorides over the duration of orthodontic treatment.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004 to summarise evidence of the effects of the use of any topical fluoride on the prevention of demineralised white lesions in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:41:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of demineralised white lesions (DWLs) on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of fluoride delivery in reducing the incidence of DWLs, as well as the size of lesions. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DWLs, and oral health&#8211;related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which topical fluoride was delivered by any method to prevent enamel demineralised white lesion (DWL) formation during orthodontic treatment with fixed braces. As topical fluorides are distributed throughout the mouth by saliva, the use of a split-mouth study design to evaluate these interventions is inappropriate. (Split-mouth studies included in the previous version of this review found no difference between teeth with fluoridated bracket adhesives and those without, supporting the view that this design is inappropriate for evaluating topical fluorides.) We have excluded split-mouth studies from the 2013 update of this review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:58:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>This assessment was conducted by using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the two-part tool to address the six specific domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other bias). Each domain includes one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry: either low risk, unclear risk or high risk.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting are addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. For blinding, two entries were used because assessments need to be made separately for (1) participants and operators/orthodontists and (2) outcome assessors. When the operator/orthodontist assessed the outcome of the trial, this was noted. The final domain ('other sources of bias') was assessed as a single entry for studies as a whole.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>After taking into account additional information provided by the authors of the trials, review authors grouped studies into the following categories.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios (RRs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we estimated mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:59:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>In parallel-group trials in which participants are randomly assigned to intervention or to control and a single outcome measure per participant is reported, the analysis is straightforward. When individuals are randomly assigned to treatment, each individual has a number of teeth exposed to the intervention or to the control. When the outcome is reported per number of teeth, the data should be adjusted for clustering within the mouth of each individual to avoid unit of analysis errors. If it is unclear from the reports of included trials whether clustering has been considered, authors were contacted to clarify how this dependence has been accounted for in the analysis.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-12-03 14:59:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>When data were not available in the printed report, or when data were unclear, we contacted the corresponding author of the study to obtain the missing data. The analysis generally includes only available data (ignoring missing data); however, we would have used methods of estimating missing standard deviations as provided in Section 7.7.3 of the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), if appropriate. Otherwise, we did not undertake any imputations or use statistical methods to allow for missing data.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-03 15:00:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>Pooling of data and meta-analysis were carried out only if sufficient similarities were noted between studies in types of participants, interventions and outcomes, including the time of the outcome measurement. If any trials were pooled, the significance of discrepancies in the estimates of treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by using Cochran's test for heterogeneity, by which heterogeneity was considered significant if P value &lt; 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance, was used to quantify heterogeneity, with I<SUP>2 </SUP>greater than 50% considered to show substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>: Section 9.5.2).</P>

<P>Only a proportion of research projects conducted are ultimately published in an indexed journal and become easily identifiable for inclusion in systematic reviews. Reporting biases arise when reporting of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of the findings of the research.

<P>If more than ten studies were included for one outcome, we would have constructed a funnel plot. Any asymmetry in the funnel plot indicating possible publication bias would have been investigated by statistical analysis using the methods introduced by <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=33008012017251739915120226154903&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Egger-1997">Egger 1997</A> (continuous outcome) and <LINK REF="REF-R_x00fc_cker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rücker 2008</LINK> (dichotomous outcome) (such analysis would have been done in STATA 11.0).</P>

<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Stecks_x00e9_n_x002d_Blicks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stecksén-Blicks 2007</LINK> compared application of fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector containing 0.1% fluoride (F) as difluorosilane in a polyurethane varnish base, Ivoclar Vivadent) every six weeks versus a non&#8211;fluoride-containing placebo varnish, in a double-blind study assessed as being at low risk of bias. The outcome was new demineralised white lesions (DWLs) identified from clinical photographs taken before and after orthodontic treatment. A reduction of DWLs (almost 70%) was associated with regular application of fluoride varnish during orthodontic treatment in this study (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-_x00d8_gaard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Øgaard 2006</LINK> compared two different types of fluoride compounds provided as toothpaste (twice daily) and mouthrinse (once daily) and supplied to participants for use during orthodontic treatment. One group received amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste (Meridol 140 parts per million (ppm) F, pH 4.5) and amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse to be used after toothbrushing at bedtime (250 ppm F, pH 4.0). The other group received neutral sodium fluoride toothpaste (1400 ppm, pH 6.7) and a sodium fluoride mouthrinse (250 ppm F, pH 6.3) to be used after brushing at bedtime.</P>
<P>The outcome of new DWLs was reported at the tooth level with no indication of correction for clustering of teeth within the mouth. The mean change in the white spot lesion index from baseline was greater in the sodium fluoride group, suggesting that this compound was less effective than amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). A slightly larger increase in both the visible plaque index and the gingival bleeding index was reported over the duration of treatment in the group exposed to sodium fluoride (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

The control group was requested to use a daily fluoride mouthrinse (Endekay rinse 0.05% w/v NaF, Stafford-Miller Ltd). The number and size of new DWLs were determined using computerised image analysis of before and after cross-polarised (to reduce flash reflections) photographic images of six anterior teeth in each participant.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:29:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence from one trial at low risk of bias indicates that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks is associated with a reduction in new demineralised white lesions (DWLs) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient to show whether amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination is more or less effective than sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination in preventing DWLs, visible plaque or gingivitis.</P>
<P>Evidence is also insufficient to show whether a reduction in the development of DWLs occurs with the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>The latest update of the review has included only parallel-group trials, in which the individual participant is the unit of randomisation. This was decided upon because of the possibility of cross-contamination between experimental and control teeth in the same mouth, either between upper and lower arches or between sides of the mouth, which might lead to under-estimation of the effectiveness of any fluoride products.</P>
<P>Interventions that rely on the patient for delivery, including fluoride mouthrinse and toothpaste, will work only if they are used regularly. They rely greatly on patient compliance to succeed; however, evidence suggests that compliance with mouthrinsing is poor among orthodontic patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Geiger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Geiger 1992</LINK>) found that only 42% of participants rinsed with a sodium fluoride mouthrinse at least every other day. Results also showed that those who complied least with fluoride rinsing regimens tended to have more DWLs. It is important to consider the acceptability of interventions to both adolescents and adults with a view toward increasing compliance with recommended dental hygiene practices.</P>
<P>Interventions that are professionally applied and deliver fluoride 'passively', such as fluoride varnish, fluoride-releasing bracket cements and fluoride-releasing elastics, avoid the need for patient compliance. In addition, these materials deliver fluoride close to the bracket, where it is most needed; however, many fluoridated materials release large amounts of fluoride initially, but the level drops rapidly and might not be sufficient to prevent decay over the whole course of orthodontic treatment. Reapplication of fluoride varnish and frequent replacement of fluoride-releasing elastics are likely to be required. In the parallel-group trial of a fluoride varnish intervention included in this review, varnish was reapplied every six weeks at each orthodontic check-up appointment. We found no parallel-group trials of fluoride-releasing cements or elastics that met the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>An interesting addition, since the initial review was carried out, is the further development of materials that produce a slow and sustained release of fluoride (<LINK REF="STD-Luther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luther 2005</LINK>). This trial was small and at high risk of bias, and evidence was insufficient to reveal whether these devices are more or less effective than a mouthrinse in reducing the development of DWLs. It is possible, that with further refinement, this technique could potentially be effective. Intraoral fluoride-releasing devices should be evaluated by double-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>When examining the effectiveness of a fluoride product in preventing dental decay, one should consider two aspects: first, whether the fluoride product reduces the number of DWLs appearing during treatment, and second, whether it reduces the severity of DWLs in terms of the size or area of the tooth surface affected, the amount of mineral lost or the depth of decay. Banks et al (<LINK REF="STD-Banks-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banks 2000</LINK>) developed the Enamel Decalcification Index, which is an ordinal index that includes an assessment of the area covered. Assessment of the size of the lesion is a useful outcome measure, but none of the studies included in this review reported this outcome.</P>
<P>Ideally the appearance of the tooth should be recorded before and after orthodontic treatment, so that the change in appearance of the tooth is measured (incidence), not just its appearance at the end (prevalence). There are many different causes of white lesions on the teeth, many of which occur during the development of the teeth. It is important that these development lesions, as well as decay that has occurred before the brace is fitted, are excluded from the analysis, hence the need for the images (photographs or fluorescent) taken before treatment. Measurement of both incidence and severity will depend on the method used to record DWLs. Two main methods may be used: visual inspection and clinical images. Both methods are associated with problems. One problem with visual inspection is that the examiner or examiners will require calibration at the start and regular recalibration throughout the experimental period to ensure consistency of measurement. The duration of the experiment might be quite long because, as discussed later, the product should ideally be tested over the entire length of orthodontic treatment. This can take between 18 and 30 months - sometimes longer. Another problem with visual recording involves masking of the assessor to the allocated intervention. To reduce bias, the examiner should not know whether the participant has received a fluoride product and this will complicate the way the experiment is run.</P>
<P>Images have the advantage of providing a permanent record of the appearance of the tooth. Assessments can be carried out by several people independently or in groups, whereby a consensus is achieved. The images can be placed in a random order and the judges masked to group allocation. In addition, because the assessment can be performed over a short period of time the problem of examiner drift, whereby an assessor might subtly change his or her assessment over time, is reduced. The challenge of using clinical photographs consists of achieving consistency in lighting and reducing reflections that can mask or mimic DWLs; however, when a careful photographic technique is applied, the advantages of photographs outweigh their potential disadvantages. Several optical and fluorescent methods are available for measuring lesions on the teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Angmar_x002d_Mansson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angmar-Mansson 1996</LINK>). These methods require specialised equipment, which would add considerably to the cost of a clinical study, but they provide an objective measurement of the amount of decay in terms of mineral loss or lesion depth or both.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:30:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>It is important to note that only one study included in this review was judged to be at low risk of bias, and this assessment was made only after contact with the author resulted in clarification of two issues. Both the design and the reporting of trials of fluorides for preventing DWLs were generally poor, even in the most recent trials published in journals for which the use of CONSORT guidelines has been adopted. In particular, the methods of random allocation, sequence generation and concealment were rarely explained. Few studies provided a flow diagram to show withdrawals and drop-outs.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:32:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>We undertook a sensitive search of several electronic sources, supplemented by searches of references lists. We placed no restriction on language or publication status. The review authors have tried, as far as possible, to identify all possible studies that might meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Study authors have been contacted, and many have replied; however, some were not able to supply the requested information, as their records have been destroyed or lost.</P>
<P>When a product, such as a bonding material, can be applied to single teeth, it is tempting to use an experimental design whereby the material being tested is used in two quadrants of the mouth and the control material is used in the other two quadrants. This is called a split-mouth design. The main advantage of the split-mouth design over a conventional parallel-group study design, in which the two materials are tested in two separate groups of individuals, is that the experimental material is tested in the same mouth, under the same conditions as the control material. In theory, any differences in outcome between the two materials are due only to their properties - not to other factors, such as differences in oral hygiene and diet between participants (with a parallel design) or even differences in oral hygiene and diet over time within the same participants (with a cross-over design).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, when one is examining the ability of fluoride products to reduce decay, it is highly unlikely that the fluoride released will be confined to only the quadrants/teeth in which the experimental material has been placed, and some contamination of the 'untreated' teeth is inevitable. This contamination will reduce the difference in outcomes between treated and untreated teeth. The previous version of this review included split-mouth studies, which failed to show any difference between treated and untreated teeth; this may be due to cross-over contamination between control and experimental sides and may reflect our contention of contamination. For this reason, we have decided to exclude split-mouth studies from this update of our review, and we recognise that changes to the protocol introduce a risk of bias to the review process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:36:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>Three other systematic reviews gathering evidence for the most effective means of preventing caries/demineralisation during fixed orthodontic appliance treatment have been reported in the literature. Derks et al (<LINK REF="REF-Derks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derks 2004</LINK>) examined all preventive measures for preventing demineralisation - not just fluoride products. These review authors had to exclude many published studies as well because of inappropriate research design or poor reporting and were unable to provide firm, evidence-based recommendations as to the prevention of DWLs during fixed orthodontic treatment.</P>
<P>A second systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2005</LINK>) investigated the effectiveness of topical fluorides used alone in preventing demineralisation during orthodontic treatment. These review authors included seven studies in their review; however, these studies were excluded from our review because the outcomes were not appropriate (DMFT/DMFS), or the participants were not examined immediately after removal of the fixed appliance(s). Although they suggest that according to their outcome measure (preventive fraction), some evidence shows that the addition of a topical fluoride preparation helps in the prevention of demineralisation during fixed orthodontic treatment, this conclusion must be viewed with caution, because these review authors were not able to calculate confidence intervals. We support their request that researchers design and report their studies using standard outcomes, so that in the future, data may be pooled and overall recommendations on preventive measures may be provided.</P>
<P>Rogers et al (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2010</LINK>) included 10 studies in their systematic review investigating the effectiveness of fluoride-containing bonding adhesives used in orthodontics to prevent demineralisation. Five of these studies were excluded from our review because they were not randomised, and a further three studies were excluded because data in the report were insufficient, and the study authors, when contacted, were unable to provide requested data. Rogers' conclusions are consistent with ours with regard to the design of trials and the quality of reporting and statistical analyses.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:51:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:46:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>Moderate quality-evidence from one well-designed clinical trial suggests that six-weekly, professional application of a varnish containing a high concentration of fluoride reduces the incidence of demineralised white lesions (DWLs) during orthodontic treatment; however, further well-designed studies are required to confirm this finding.</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient for review authors to recommend the use of intraoral fluoride-releasing devices. Such interventions, provided they sustain the release of fluoride, have the potential to be effective, as they reduce the requirement for patient compliance. Fluoride mouthrinses, in addition to fluoride toothpastes, have been found to be effective in reducing caries in non-orthodontic patients, but no direct evidence from this review indicates that these interventions are effective in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. It is likely that fluorides that do not require patient compliance will be more effective in preventing DWLs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-04 11:51:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More evidence is required before the most effective way of delivering fluoride to the orthodontic patient can be determined. In particular, fluoride delivery methods that do not require patient compliance should be studied. Adequately powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, with appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment and masking of outcome assessment, are needed. However, a placebo-only group may be considered unethical. The use of factorial designs, whereby two or more experimental interventions are evaluated simultaneously allowing for the evaluation of possible interaction between the interventions, can be evaluated separately. Researchers should, however, be aware that increasing the number of arms in a trial will substantially increase the number of participants required to demonstrate a statistical difference between interventions.</P>
<P>Another weakness of many studies was that they were undertaken over a relatively short period of orthodontic treatment. Short-term studies tend to overestimate the effectiveness of an intervention, particularly if it is a fluoride product, which releases high levels of fluoride initially, or if the intervention requires sustained patient co-operation. The effectiveness of products over the full duration of orthodontic treatment should be assessed. The influence of confounders, such as diet, fluoridated water supplies and age of the participant, as well as other outcomes, including participant-reported data, should be included in trial designs.</P>
<P>The use of images to record the condition of the tooth before and after treatment should be encouraged. Images provide a permanent record, allowing before and after comparisons of the incidence and severity of DWLs with proper assessor blinding, error analysis and consensus measures. To provide a reproducible method of recording DWLs using photographs, a standard technique is required, with thought given to reduction of flash reflection, magnification and drying of the teeth. Optical and fluorescent methods of providing a quantitative measurement of mineral loss should be encouraged if funding allows. Studies ideally should assess participant-centred outcomes, including the effect of DWLs on quality of life, particularly six months or a year after treatment.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:00:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Philip E Benson">
<P>In the 2013 update of this review, controlled clinical trials (quasi-randomised) were excluded.</P>
<P>A point of clarification was added to the inclusion criteria for this review. For a randomised controlled trial to be included, demineralised white lesions (DWLs) must be assessed on teeth remaining in the mouth. Studies that evaluated demineralisation of extracted teeth were excluded from the 2013 update of this review because they measured the effects of short-term exposure to fluoride (four to six weeks between application and extraction of the teeth). Furthermore, it was decided that evaluation of demineralisation must take place at the end of treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances (debonding).</P>
<P>As stated in the Discussion of the previous version of this review, the use of a split-mouth study design to evaluate these interventions is potentially inappropriate. It is unlikely that the fluoride released will be confined to only the quadrants or the specific teeth in which the experimental material has been placed, and some 'contamination' of teeth in the control quadrants is inevitable. This will reduce the difference in outcome between experimental and control teeth and will reduce the power of the trial to find a difference. Indeed split-mouth studies included in the previous version of this review found no difference between teeth with fluoridated bracket adhesives and those without, supporting the view that this design is inappropriate for evaluating topical fluorides. Split-mouth studies were excluded from the 2013 update of this review, and the Methods sections of this review was amended to remove methods that were used to deal with split-mouth studies.</P>
