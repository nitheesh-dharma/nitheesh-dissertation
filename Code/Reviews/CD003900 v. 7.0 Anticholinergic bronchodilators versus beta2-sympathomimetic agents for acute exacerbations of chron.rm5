The results in the text have been altered to match this, and the erroneous reference to an Odds Ratio changed to WMD. I have also changed the default statistic to use a fixed method as there are few studies and no statistical heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: - Methods of the review. As far as I can see from the table of included studies you have analysed Karpel using first arm data as if it was a parallel trial. This seems very reasonable in view of the possibility of carry-over. I am unclear how you used the paired t-test data from the Lloberes study and whether again you used first arm data. Could you clarify how cross-overs were handled please?&lt;br&gt;Methodological quality of included studies: &amp;quot;All but one of the studies (Lloberes) was randomized.&amp;quot; As it stands this is confusing as non-RCTs were excluded. Could this be explained in the text (as you do in the table of included studies please).&lt;br&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;Also, two studies reported variances only for pre-and post-treatment scores, rather than the observed pre-post changes. We then had to estimate the variance of changes with the sum of the pre- and post-treatment variances, which overestimates the true variance and decreases the power of our analysis.&amp;quot; Good point - please insert links to show which these two studies were.&lt;br&gt;Is it worth putting in the text the admission to hospital data and making a comparison table for this data as most of the studies are in ED and this is an important outcome for patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:- At present this uses too many technical terms which will not be understood by consumers. This needs a re-write please (eg Dyspnoea could be replaced with shortness of breath) and made short and simple. The question being addressed, number of studies and bottom line results ( no significant difference between types of drug or addition of anticholinergics, as in the current final sentence.) I think results and CIs can be put in the abstract and are not appropriate here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had a stab at this but you may wish to re-write yourselves, perhaps with the help of a consumer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author reply pasted in here on 15/3/2&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read our review. Your comments were very helpful. I have made some of the changes you suggested. Attached is an edited review for your final approval. Her is a check list of what/where to look for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Table of included studies - I put the explanation of abbreviations in the notes section of the table. VERY CLEAR, THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Methods of review - The information of how the cross over stidies were handled is actually under the statistical considerations heading. I did expand on this point a little and commented on the paired t-test. It was not a factor in our analysis. FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Medologiacl quality - The method of enrollment is included in this section. Because the patients were blinded, I felt that the data was less likely to be biased. I REMAIN CONFUSED AS TO WHETHER LLOBERES WAS RANDOMISED OR NOT. THE INCLUDED STUDIES TABLE SUGGESTS THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN WHICH CASE PLEASE REMOVE THE SENTENCE THAT ALL BUT ONE STUDY WAS RANDOMISED???? IF NOT AN RCT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Discussion - links were made GREAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Synopsis - totally rewritten. I await your comments on this version MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not put admission data in the review because only 1 study included actual numbers (Karpel) and they were statistically insignificant. The other ED studies confirm that the admissions were small in number and not significant for quantification by them. UNDERSTOOD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let know what you think of the changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Brown, Cynthia D] &lt;br&gt;23/3/2002 &lt;br&gt;Chris: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reread the review and revised the statement I made about Lloberes in methodological quality of studies. Please read and if it works, then it is okay for sending on for publication. Thanks for all your input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cynthia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23/3/2002 discussed with Paul - problems in relation to randomisation for Looberes and the fact that Myoaddi is an in-patient study. He will look in to this and get back to Cynthia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-06-30 13:56:11 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="ACBR-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.13" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Shortness of breath is the main complaint of persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This symptom worsens during an exacerbation or 'flare' of COPD. Trials comparing ipratropium bromide versus beta-agonists showed no significant difference in short-term or long-term effects (24 hours) on ease of breathing. Side effects of these drugs were reported by only a minority of patients and include dry mouth and tremor, and a 'strange feeling' after drug administration.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled bronchodilators form the mainstay of treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. Two types of agent are used routinely, either singly or in combination: anticholinergic agents and beta2-sympathomimetic agonists.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of anti-cholinergic agents on lung function and dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, compared with placebo or short-acting beta-2 agonists.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register using pre-specified terms. We also searched references listed in each included trial for additional trial reports. Searches were current as of October 2005 and will be updated annually.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included studies if the participants were adult patients with a known diagnosis of COPD and had symptoms consistent with criteria for acute exacerbation of COPD. All randomized controlled trials that compared inhaled ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide to appropriate controls were considered. Appropriate control treatments included placebo, other bronchodilating agents, or combination therapies. Studies of acute asthma or ventilated patients were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed all trials that appeared to be relevant who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials compared the short-term effects of ipratropium bromide versus a beta2-agonist. Short-term changes in FEV1 (up to 90 minutes) showed no significant difference between beta2-agonist and ipratropium bromide treated patients. The differences were similar among the studies and when combined: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.0 liters (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) -0.19 to 0.19). There was no significant additional increase in change in FEV1 on adding ipratropium to beta2-agonist: WMD 0.02 liter (95% CI -0.08 to 0.12). Long-term effects (24 hours) of the ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist treatment combination were similar: WMD 0.05 liters (95% CI -0.14 to 0.05). </P>
<P>Neither of two studies found significant changes in PaO2, either short- or long-term, with ipratropium versus beta-agonist, although one showed an increase in PaO2 in subjects receiving ipratropium bromide at 60 minutes. Adverse drug reactions included dry mouth and tremor.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation achieved with ipratropium bromide was greater than that using a short-acting beta2-agonist. The combination of a beta2-agonist and ipratropium did not appear to increase the effect on FEV1 more than either used alone.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-30 13:56:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Dyspnea secondary to airflow limitation is the main complaint of persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cause of chronic airflow limitation is a combination of the accumulation of mucous in the airways and hypertrophy/constriction of bronchial smooth muscle. Additionally, inflammatory cells infiltrate the airways and contribute to mucous secretion and airway edema. Mucous accumulation in COPD is due to the increased number and size of mucous glands and goblet cells in the airway wall. These cell types are stimulated to increase the production and release of mucous through mediators of inflammation. Smooth muscles surround the bronchi; when they are stimulated, their contraction causes physical narrowing of the airways. Hypertrophy of the smooth muscle further decreases the diameter of the effective airway. Control of these functions (or dysfunction) is the central airway muscarinic receptor. It is here that the mediators bind and create the narrowed/obstructed airway. </P>
<P>The natural history of moderate to severe COPD is punctuated by acute exacerbations, in which worsening symptoms of dyspnea and an increase in amount or purulence of sputum may be accompanied by chest discomfort, fever, and other constitutional symptoms. The increasing dyspnea of acute exacerbations is due to an increase in mucous production, inflammation and broncho-constriction, leading to further compromising of airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations are often the reason that those with mild disease seek medical care. Treatment is often multifaceted, with antibiotics, corticosteroids and bronchodilators.</P>
<P>Anti-cholinergic receptor blockers act by preventing the stimulation of muscarinic receptors. By blocking the activity of the receptor, the level of bronchoconstriction and mucous production is lessened. This review will evaluate the evidence for using anti-cholinergic medications to achieve relief of dyspnea during COPD exacerbations. Currently available inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators include ipratropium, oxitropium and tiotropium bromide (only ipratropium bromide is available in the US at this time).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To describe and assess the effect of anti-cholinergic agents such as ipratropium and oxitropium bromide, administered by inhalation, on ventilatory function and dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-30 13:55:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomized controlled trials comparing inhaled ipratropium bromide. oxitropium bromide or tiotropium bromide with appropriate control where other co-interventions are standardized. Studies of acute asthma were excluded. Appropriate control treatments include placebo, other bronchodilating agents, or combination therapies.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies were included if the participants are adult patients with a known diagnosis of COPD and have symptoms of acute exacerbation increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, or sputum purulence consistent with criteria for defining/diagnosing acute exacerbation of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies of patients receiving ventilatory assistance were excluded. We assumed that most cases of exacerbation were due to infection, but did not limit the target population to this suspected etiology. We expected that patients with acute exacerbations of COPD could have various co-morbidities (such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary embolus) or complications of COPD (e.g. pneumothorax) as the etiology of exacerbation of their symptoms. We required that studies in some way assured that patients with other reasons for these symptoms were not studied.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any studies employing ipratropium or oxitropium bromide administered by inhalation via nebulizer, or metered dose inhaler.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcome measures included:<BR/>(1) Lung function measurements, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)<BR/>(2) Arterial blood gas measurements<BR/>(3) Symptom scores<BR/>The above short term outcomes will be assessed as post-treatment data or change from pre- to post-treatment in two time frames - within 90 minutes and greater than one day.</P>
<P>Outcomes also to be assessed:<BR/>(4) Health status or quality of life assessments<BR/>(5) Functional capacity - timed walking tests, endurance tests<BR/>(6) Health services utilization measures, duration of hospitalization or time to emergency room discharge<BR/>(7) Hospital readmission or return to emergency room<BR/>(8) Mortality<BR/>(9) Adverse drug reactions.</P>

<P>All trials were entered and scored using the following principles:<BR/>Grade A - Double blind<BR/>Grade B - Single blind<BR/>Grade C - Obviously not blinded or not known</P>
<P>The internal validity of individual trials was assessed using the scale devised by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, which was operationalized as follows:<BR/>(1) Was the study described as randomized? (1 = yes; 0 = no)<BR/>(2) Was the method of randomization well described and adequate? (0 = not described; 1 = described and adequate; -1 = described, but not adequate)<BR/>(3) Was the study described as double-blind? (1 = yes; 0 = no)<BR/>(4) Was the method of double-blinding well described and adequate? (0 = not described; 1 = described and adequate; -1 = described, but not adequate)<BR/>(5) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts sufficient to determine the number of patients in each treatment group entering and completing the trial? (1 = yes; 0 = no).</P>
<P>The external validity of the trials was described using the following features:</P>
<P>(1) Validity of the underlying COPD diagnosis:<BR/>(a) Is COPD diagnosis based on spirometry-based criteria (e.g. ATS (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>) or Siafakas (<LINK REF="REF-Siafakas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siafakas 1995</LINK>))?<BR/>(b) Is the baseline stable FEV1 of study population described?</P>
<P>(2) Validity of diagnosis of AECB (Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis):<BR/>Does the definition of AECB include at least two of the following: increased sputum production, increased sputum volume, and increased dyspnea?</P>
<P>(3) Characterization of severity of AECB:<BR/>Does the study describe the severity of AECB at enrollment based upon at least two of the following domains:<BR/>(a) Mental status change<BR/>(b) Work of breathing (e.g. respiratory rate or use of accessory muscles)?<BR/>(c) Ventilatory status (e.g. FEV1 or PEFR, O2 saturation or pO2 and pCO2)?<BR/>(4) Duration of follow-up:<BR/>Is there an outcome assessment at 24 hours or longer?</P>

<P>For crossover studies, we only analyzed first arm data (before the change over). This was to prevent the possibility of effects from the previously administered drug contaminating the second set of results. <LINK REF="STD-Lloberes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lloberes 1988</LINK> used a paired t-test to compare the change in FEV1 seen between drugs administered in each arm of the protocols. Because we did not use information from the second arm, the paired t-tests were not of value. We utilized the raw data (actual change in FEV1 +/- a calculated standard deviation) in our analyses.</P>

<P>A combined database of 1267 entries was created from the results of MEDLINE and COPD-RCT register literature searches. After excluding articles that focused on pediatric patients and/or asthma there were 342 entries for further evaluation. We then excluded studies in which the study population had stable COPD. Twenty-two studies were selected for full-text evaluation for inclusion in the review. Of those 22 reports, only nine were RCTs that met the criteria for inclusion (See characteristics of included/excluded studies). An updated search in October 2005 did not identify any further studies for inclusion.</P>
<P>We identified no placebo-controlled comparisons of ipratropium bromide. Four studies permitted a direct comparison of ipratropium to an inhaled beta2-agonist (<LINK REF="STD-Backman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Backman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lloberes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lloberes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK>).

<P>All but one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lloberes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lloberes 1988</LINK>) was randomized. Instead, they tested the same 13 participants on three different occasions when admitted for AECB. Each time, the subjects received drugs by a different protocol and the protocols were compared to each other. The participants were blinded as to the medications being administered. <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK> used a computer generated randomization schedule, while <LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 1995</LINK> used a block-design scheme. <LINK REF="STD-Patrick-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patrick 1990</LINK> used a random number sequence known only to the pharmacist dispensing the drugs. A random drawing of pieces of paper was the method employed by <LINK REF="STD-Shretha-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shretha 1991</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Driscoll-1989" TYPE="STUDY">O'Driscoll 1989</LINK> used the subjects year of birth to determine which drug a study enrollee would receive. In those studies that added ipratropium to a beta-agonist, placebos were used for those not randomized to the study drug (ipratropium). The remaining studies did not detail the method of randomization in their methods. </P>
<P>Three studies were either single-blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Lloberes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lloberes 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moayyedi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moayyedi 1995</LINK>) or not blinded at all (<LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK>). The remaining six studies were designed in a double-blind format. ATS criteria were utilized for the diagnosis of COPD and COPD exacerbations in almost all of the included studies. In the two studies that did not employ ATS criteria, <LINK REF="STD-Backman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Backman 1985</LINK> used the criteria set by the British MRC and <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK> did not state the diagnostic criteria used in its evaluation. Severity of disease was described using FEV1 and/or PEFR at the time of entry into the study. Spirometry was overwhelmingly the outcome measurement of choice.</P>
<P>The following parameters were used to measure efficacy: change in FEV1, PEFR, PaO2, and PaCO2. Because all the participants were admitted to hospitals for care of severe exacerbations, the participant population tended to include those patients with more severe disease (i.e. FEV1 &lt; 1 liter). There was also a lack of standardization of co-interventions in the studies. All allowed the use of additional medications, such as corticosteroids, theophylline, and antibiotics; however, use of these interventions was left to the discretion of the admitting physician.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The most common outcome reported was FEV1. All but two studies reported short-term (up to 90 minutes) changes in FEV1. The exceptions, <LINK REF="STD-Moayyedi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moayyedi 1995</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Patrick-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patrick 1990</LINK>, described changes in FEV1 at 24 hours after starting treatment. Both of these studies tested the potential benefits of adding ipratropium bromide to a treatment regimen already including a beta2-agonist. </P>
<P>Four trials compared the short-term effects of ipratropium bromide versus beta2-agonists. Short-term changes in FEV1 (up to 90 minutes) showed no significant difference between beta-agonists and ipratropium bromide treated patients. The differences were similar among the studies and when combined resulted in a Weighted Mean Difference of 0.0 liters with a 95% confidence interval range from -0.19 liters to +0.19 liters. </P>
<P>There were five studies describing the change in FEV1 after adding ipratropium to a beta2-agonist treatment regimen. Three studies, looking at short-term effects, found no advantage to adding ipratropium to beta2-agonist treatment. The 95% confidence range for the Weighted Mean Difference in this group is -0.08 liters to 0.12 liters. Long-term effects (24 hours) of the ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist treatment combination confirm this finding with a Weighted Mean Difference of -0.05 liters (95%CI -0.14, 0.05). </P>
<P>The data on changes in blood gases were limited. Only two of the nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Backman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Backman 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK>) reported changes in hypoxia measures. Neither found significant changes in PaO2, either short- or long-term. <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK> showed an increase in PaO2 in subjects receiving ipratropium bromide at 60 minutes. At the same time, those receiving metaproterenol showed a decrease in PaO2. However, this difference was gone after 90 minutes, when levels returned to baseline.</P>
<P>Adverse drug reactions were reported by only a minority of the included studies (n = 4). The reaction described dry mouth and tremor (<LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK>), and a 'strange feeling' after drug administration (<LINK REF="STD-Backman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Backman 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Driscoll-1989" TYPE="STUDY">O'Driscoll 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK> specifically looked at hemodynamic changes and found no differences between the treatment groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation achieved with ipratropium bromide was greater than that using a short-acting beta2-agonist. The combination of a beta2-agonist and ipratropium did not appear to increase the effect on FEV1 more than either used alone. </P>
<P>Only a few studies have been conducted in populations of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. The studies available for this analysis describe both short- and long-term impact on ventilatory function. The analysis of these studies does not show that ipratropium bromide has a greater effect than beta2-agonists. The results showed similar effects and the combined estimate of no difference in the studies looking at short term effects of ipratropium versus beta2-agonist. Studies looking at the effects of combination treatment also found no statistically significant differences. </P>
<P>A major limitation of this analysis is the small number of studies performed in this patient population. The few studies that met criteria for inclusion had a scarcity of subjects. Also, two studies reported variances only for pre-and post-treatment scores, rather than the observed pre-post changes (<LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lloberes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lloberes 1988</LINK>). We then had to estimate the variance of changes with the sum of the pre- and post-treatment variances, which overestimates the true variance and decreases the power of our analysis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Ipratropium bromide appears to result in short-term improvement of FEV1 and PEFR. The effect was at least equivalent to beta2-agonists and combined treatment appears to be no more effective than the use of either as a single agent. In all studies, the use of a bronchodilator improved FEV1 and PEFR. Symptomatic benefits were not assessed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Few studies of bronchodilating drugs have been performed in populations with acute exacerbation of COPD. Most studies included one or more additional medications, usually a corticosteroid, an antibiotic, or both, which may confound the results. In order to determine the true effect of anti-cholinergic drugs on the short and long term outcomes of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, we would ideally conduct a large, multi-center RCT with strict control of co-interventions . Studies should measure both the objective changes (i.e. FEV1, PEFR, PaO2) and the more subjective patient-oriented outcomes such as quality of life, dyspoena, symptom scores. This may not be possible because of ethical constraints in trying to perform research on therapies that have already become a part of standard and accepted patient care.</P>

<P>Co-interventions: Pts with signs of an acute infection (fever, pneumonic infiltration, and positive sputum bacteriology) were treated with antibiotics before the start of the trial; pts taking beta2-receptor stimulants (n = 16) stopped them at least 8 hrs before starting the trial; all pts received daily physical treatment; otherwise, pts continued their usual regimens, which included oral theophyllamine (n = 7), combination treatment with ephedrine and hydroxyzine (n = 4), prednisolone (n = 2), and no continuous treatment (n = 7)</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>FEV1: Measured on the 1st and 7th day immediately before and 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the morning study drug administration. Investigators compared mean FEV1 scores for identical timepoints on days 1 and 7. Blood gases: Arterial PaO2 and PaCO2 measured on 1st and 7th day. Investigators analyzed change from day 1 to 7. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any of the outcomes measured (no between-group p-values reported). Dropouts: 1/40 pts (2.5%), treatment group N/S</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>

<P>FEV1 improvements were small with both interventions. In the ipratropium group (n = 17), mean scores at 15 min (p &lt; 0.02) and 30 min (p &lt; 0.05) post-treatment were significantly higher on the 7th day than on the 1st; no significant differences were noted between the 1st and 7th day at 0, 5, 10, 60, 120, or 240 min. In the fenoterol group (n = 20), mean scores at 60 min post-treatment were significantly higher on the 7th day than on the 1st (p &lt; 0.05); otherwise, no significant differences were observed between the 1st and 7th day.</P>
<P>Mean pre-treatment FEV1 scores on days 1 and 7 were:</P>

<P>Blood gases/oximetry: Investigators stated that there were no significant changes in PaO2 or PaCO2 from day 1 to day 7 in either group, but did not report any data.</P>
<P>Adverse events: 1/19 pts (5%) taking ipratropium and 1/20 (5%) taking fenoterol complained of a "strange feeling"<BR/>Two pts in the ipratropium group who did not withdraw prematurely were unable to perform spirometry and so were not included in the FEV1 analysis</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>It is said in the review that 9 studies were included. However only eight were characterized in the table (Backman 1985 was not), 1 study concerning glycopyrrolate not ipratropium (Cydulka 1995) was not included into the analysis (the authors did not mention it), the study of O'Driscoll 1989 was included only into the analysis of safety and not of efficacy. The objective was to compare the effect of anti-cholinergic agents with beta-2 agonists, in Karpel 1990 metaproterenol was used which is beta-agonist (not beta-2 agonist).</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Dr. Lesniak raises a number of issues:</P>
<P>1. The exclusion of the Backman (1985) study from the "characteristics of included studies" table was an oversight on our part. Thank you for pointing this out. It will be remedied at the time of the next update. [This has now been addressed]</P>
<P>2. Although our inclusion criteria state that only ipratropium or oxitropium interventions are included in the review we describe the Cydulka (1995) study because its intervention glycopyrrolate, is an anticholinergic drug which is the scope implied by the review's title "Anti-cholinergic bronchodilators versus beta2-sympathomimetic agents for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease". We will update the inclusion criteria in the next update of the review.</P>
<P>3. The O'Driscoll study (1989) was included only in the safety analysis because the efficacy results did not include any variance data (standard deviation or SEM). The graph depicted a standard error bar, however, it was too poorly resolved to provide an accurate estimate of the SEM. Had variance data been available, the peak flow outcome from O'Driscoll could have bee combined with those from Backman (1985) which also included peak flow changes. Our safety analysis was based on the number of patients having an event, which did not require mean deviation data.</P>
<P>4. Karpel 1990: Metaproterenol is not a strict beta-2 agonist; it has both beta-1 and beta-2 agonist properties. It has been used as a bronchodilator for a long time. Many of the more currently used short-acting beta-2 agonists were given approval for use based on efficacy studies versus metaproterenol. This is why we felt comfortable including the study in our analysis. When this study is removed from the analysis, the results do not change. (WMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.22 without Karpel 1990).</P>
