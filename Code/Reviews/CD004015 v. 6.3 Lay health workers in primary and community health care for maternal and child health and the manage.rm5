<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-15 16:01:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of the effect of using lay health workers to improve mother and child health and to help people with infectious diseases was carried out by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 82 studies. Their findings are summarised below. </P>
<P>
<B>What is a lay health worker?</B>
</P>
<P>A lay health worker is a member of the community who has received some training to promote health or to carry out some healthcare services, but is not a healthcare professional. In the studies in this review, lay health workers carried out different tasks. These included giving help and advice about issues such as child health, child illnesses, and medicine taking. In some studies, lay health workers also treated people for particular health problems.</P>
<P>The studies took place in different settings. In many of the studies, lay health workers worked among people on low incomes in wealthy countries, or among people living in poor countries.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says</B>
</P>
<P>The use of lay health workers, compared to usual healthcare services:</P>
<P>- probably leads to an increase in the number of women who start to breastfeed their child; who breastfeed their child at all; and who feed their child with breastmilk only; </P>
<P>- probably leads to an increase in the number of children who have their immunization schedule up to date;</P>
<P>- may lead to slightly fewer children who suffer from fever, diarrhoea and pneumonia;</P>
<P>- may lead to fewer deaths among children under five;</P>
<P>- may increase the number of parents who seek help for their sick child.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The use of lay health workers, compared to people helping themselves or going to a clinic:</P>
<P>- probably leads to an increase in the number of people with tuberculosis who are cured;</P>
<P>- probably makes little or no difference in the number of people who complete preventive treatment for tuberculosis.</P>

<P>Eighty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. These showed considerable diversity in the targeted health issue and the aims, content, and outcomes of interventions. The majority were conducted in high income countries (n = 55) but many of these focused on low income and minority populations. The diversity of included studies limited meta-analysis to outcomes for four study groups. These analyses found evidence of moderate quality of the effectiveness of LHWs in promoting immunisation childhood uptake (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.37; P = 0.0004); promoting initiation of breastfeeding (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.61; P &lt; 0.00001), any breastfeeding (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39; P = 0.0004), and exclusive breastfeeding (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.74 to 4.44; P &lt;0.0001); and improving pulmonary TB cure rates (RR 1.22 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) P &lt;0.0001), when compared to usual care. There was moderate quality evidence that LHW support had little or no effect on TB preventive treatment completion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; P = 0.99). There was also low quality evidence that LHWs may reduce child morbidity (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03) and child (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.03; P = 0.07) and neonatal (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; P = 0.07) mortality, and increase the likelihood of seeking care for childhood illness (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.05; P = 0.20). For other health issues, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness, or to enable the identification of specific LHW training or intervention strategies likely to be most effective.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-06 04:07:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lay health workers (LHWs) perform diverse functions related to healthcare delivery. While LHWs are usually provided with job-related training, they have no formal professional or paraprofessional tertiary education and can be involved in either paid or voluntary care. The term LHW is thus necessarily broad in scope and includes, for example, community health workers, village health workers, treatment supporters, and birth attendants.</P>
<P>The primary healthcare approach adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) at Alma-Ata promoted the initiation and rapid expansion of LHW programmes in low and middle income country (LMIC) settings in the 1970s, including a number of large national programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Walt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walt 1990</LINK>). However, the effectiveness and cost of such programmes came to be questioned in the following decade, particularly at a national level in the LMICs. Several evaluations were conducted and these indicated difficulties in the scaling up of LHW programmes, as a consequence of a range of factors. Important constraints included inadequate training and ongoing supervision; insecure funding for incentives, equipment and drugs; failure to integrate LHW initiatives with the formal health system; poor planning; and opposition from health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Frankel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walt 1990</LINK>). These constraints led to poor quality care and difficulties in retaining trained LHWs in many of the programmes. However, most of these evaluations were uncontrolled case studies that could not produce robust assessments of effectiveness.</P>
<P>The 1990s saw renewed interest in community or LHW programmes in LMICs. This was prompted by a number of factors including the growing AIDS epidemic; the resurgence of other infectious diseases; and the failure of the formal health system to provide adequate care for people with chronic illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 1999</LINK>). The growing emphasis on decentralisation and partnership with community-based organisations also contributed to this renewed interest. In high income country settings, a perceived need for mechanisms to deliver health care to minority communities and to support people with a wide range of health issues (<LINK REF="REF-Hesselink-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesselink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witmer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witmer 1995</LINK>) led to further growth in a wide range of LHW interventions.</P>
<P>More recently, the growing focus on the human resource crisis in health care in many LMICs has re-energised debates regarding the roles that LHWs may play in extending services to 'hard to reach' groups and areas; and in substituting for health professionals for a range of tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Chopra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopra 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>). Task shifting is not a new concept, however it has been given particular prominence and urgency in the face of the demands placed on health systems in a number of settings by the increased need for treatment of HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Hermann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermann 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachariah-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachariah 2009</LINK>). Within this context, it is thought that LHWs may be able to play an important role in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for health, particularly for child survival and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haines-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haines 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2008</LINK>). For example, LHWs may be one route to expanding the coverage of effective neonatal and child health interventions, such as exclusive breastfeeding and community-based case management of pneumonia, which remains under 50% in many LMICs (<LINK REF="REF-Darmstadt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darmstadt 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast to earlier initiatives that tended to focus on generalist LHWs delivering a range of services within communities, more recent programmes have often been vertical in their approach. In these programmes LHWs deliver a single or a small number of focused interventions addressing a particular health issue, such as promotion of vaccination; or one aspect of treatment care, such as supporting treatment adherence for people with TB (<LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2008</LINK>). The growth of interest in LHW programmes, whether vertical or generalist, has, however, generally occurred in the absence of robust evidence on their effects. Given that these interventions may have adverse effects, for example if LHWs provide inappropriate care, in addition to having considerable direct and indirect costs, such evidence is needed to ensure LHWs do more good than harm.</P>
<P>In 2005, Lewin et al published a Cochrane systematic review examining the global evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (published up to 2001) on the effects of LHW interventions in primary and community health care (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2005</LINK>). This review indicated promising benefits for LHW interventions in promoting immunization uptake; improving outcomes for selected infectious diseases; and for increasing the breastfeeding of infants in comparison with usual care. For other health issues, the review suggested that the outcomes were too diverse to allow statistical pooling. While a number of other reviews of LHW programmes have been published since, some have a focus that is wider than effectiveness (for example <LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2007</LINK>) while others examine the effects of LHWs for one area of intervention or health (for example <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an update of the 2005 systematic review, focusing on the effects of LHW interventions in improving maternal and child health (MCH) and managing infectious diseases. A second review, providing an update on the evidence of the effects of LHW interventions for chronic diseases, will be published later.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of healthcare providers</HEADING>
<P>Any lay health worker (paid or voluntary) including community health workers, village health workers, birth attendants, peer counsellors, nutrition workers, home visitors.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, we defined the term lay health worker as any health worker who:</P>
<UL>
<LI>performed functions related to healthcare delivery,</LI>
<LI>was trained in some way in the context of the intervention, but</LI>
<LI>had received no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exclusions</HEADING>
<P>We excluded interventions in which a healthcare function was performed as an extension to a participant's profession (for example teachers providing health promotion in schools). We defined the term profession in this study as remunerated work for which formal tertiary education was required.</P>
<P>We did not consider formally trained nurse aides, medical assistants, physician assistants, paramedical workers in emergency and fire services, and other self-defined health professionals or health paraprofessionals. We also excluded trainee health professionals and trainees of any of the cadres listed above.</P>
<P>We also made other exclusions. Some of these exclusions were not specified in the original protocol but were developed as issues emerged from papers considered for the original review and for this review update. They were interventions: </P>
<UL>
<LI>involving patient support groups only, as these interventions were seen as different to LHW interventions in that the lay people involved meet only to provide each other with informal support rather than to provide care or services to others, and also seldom receive training in the context of the intervention;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>involving teachers delivering health promotion or related activities in schools. We reasoned that this large and important system of LHWs constitutes a unique group (teachers) and setting (schools) that, due to the scale and importance, would be better addressed in a separate systematic review;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>involving peer health counselling programmes in schools, in which pupils teach other pupils about health issues as part of the school curriculum. Again, we reasoned that this type of intervention contains a unique group and setting that is better suited to a separate review;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>in which the LHW was a family member trained to deliver care and provide support only to members of his or her own family (that is in which LHWs did not provide some sort of care or service to others, or were unavailable to other members of the community). These interventions were assessed as qualitatively different from other LHW interventions included in this review given that parents or spouses have an established close relationship with those receiving care which could affect the process and effects of the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>All of these interventions targeted 'closed' groups of clients, that is clients who, for the purposes of the intervention, are not part of the general population.</P>
<P>We also excluded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>LHWs in non-primary level institutions (e.g. referral hospitals);</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>RCTs of interventions to train self-management tutors who were health professionals rather than lay persons. Furthermore, RCTs that compared lay self management with other forms of management (i.e. those that did not focus on the training of tutors etc.) were also excluded as these were concerned with the effects of empowering people to manage their own health issues rather than with the effects of interventions using LHWs. These studies are the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2007</LINK>). RCTs of interventions to train self-management tutors who were themselves lay persons were eligible for inclusion in this review;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>'Head-to-head' comparisons of different LHW interventions. It was felt that these should be reviewed separately as they address the question of the relative effectiveness of different types of LHW interventions rather than the question of the effects of LHWs compared to other types of intervention;</LI>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-06 04:08:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any intervention delivered by LHWs and intended to improve maternal or child health (MCH) or the management of infectious diseases. We included interventions if the description was adequate for us to establish that it was a LHW intervention. Where such detail was unclear, we contacted study authors, whenever possible, to establish whether the personnel described were LHWs.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, a MCH or infectious diseases intervention was defined as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Child health: any interventions aimed at improving the health of children aged less than five years.</LI>
<LI>Maternal health: any interventions aimed at improving reproductive health, ensuring safe motherhood, or directed at women in their role as carers for children aged less than five years.</LI>
<LI>Infectious diseases: any interventions aimed at preventing, diagnosing, or treating communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhoeal diseases.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We decided to include infectious diseases in this review (rather than in the sister review on chronic diseases) as many of these are highly relevant to MCH (for example diarrhoeal diseases, malaria). In addition, this review includes a number of comparisons that are of high interest to LMICs. LHW interventions to support adherence to TB and HIV treatment are also highly relevant to these settings.</P>

<P>Two review authors assessed independently the risk of bias of all included trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We grouped together studies that compared broadly similar types of interventions (n = 76), as listed below. The remaining eight studies were extremely diverse and could not be usefully grouped. We considered grouping the studies by type of LHW. However, doing this would have resulted in groups of interventions that were very dissimilar in other ways (for example, peer counsellors to promote TB treatment taking and peer counsellors to support women at risk of abuse would have been included in one group), and for which it would not have been feasible, or useful from a policy perspective, to pool findings. We therefore grouped together studies according to the type of health issue that the LHWs addressed. </P>
<P>1. LHW interventions to promote immunisation uptake compared with usual care.</P>
<P>2. LHW interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity in children under five compared with usual care. Analysis was undertaken for the following outcomes:</P>
<P>2.1 mortality among children under five years,</P>
<P>2.2 neonatal mortality,</P>
<P>2.3 child morbidity,</P>
<P>2.4 care-seeking behaviour.</P>
<P>3. LHW interventions to promote breastfeeding compared with usual care. Analysis was undertaken for the following outcomes:</P>
<P>3.1. initiation of breastfeeding,</P>
<P>3.2. any breastfeeding up to 12 months post partum,</P>
<P>3.3. exclusive breastfeeding up to six months post partum.</P>
<P>4. LHW interventions to provide support to mothers of sick children compared with usual care.</P>
<P>5. LHW interventions to prevent or reduce child abuse compared with usual care.</P>
<P>6. LHW interventions to promote parent-child interaction or health promotion compared with usual care.</P>
<P>7. LHW interventions to support women with a high risk of low birthweight babies or other poor outcomes in pregnancy compared with usual care.</P>
<P>8. LHW interventions to improve TB treatment and prophylaxis outcomes compared with other forms of adherence support.</P>
<P>Where feasible, we combined the results of the included studies to obtain an overall estimate of effect. This was possible for the subgroups 1 to 3 and 8 listed above. Outcome comparisons for LHW interventions to promote the uptake of breastfeeding and immunization were expressed as adherence to beneficial health behaviour. Outcomes for the subgroups including LHW interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality in children were expressed as the number of events (mortality and morbidity). Only dichotomous outcomes were included in meta-analysis owing to the methodological complications involved in combining and interpreting studies in which different continuous outcome measures have been used. Differences in baseline variables were rare and not considered influential. We re-analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis, where possible: beneficial health behaviours were analysed on a worst case basis, that is persons lost to follow up were assumed to be non-adherent to the beneficial health behaviours. In the same way, morbidity and mortality were analysed on a best case basis, that is persons lost to follow`up were assumed to be alive and not to have experienced any morbidity events.</P>
<P>In two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK> (outcome: initiated breastfeeding) and <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2008</LINK> (outcomes: initiated breastfeeding and reported illness in children), the results were presented as cluster means. The number of events in each groups was estimated as (N*cluster mean/100).</P>
<P>We made adjustment for clustering for studies that used a cluster randomised design. Where no information on the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was reported in any of the cluster RCTs included in the analysis group, we assumed an ICC of 0.02 for this adjustment. This ICC is typical of primary and community care interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>). Where an ICC was reported among the studies in a group, this ICC was used for the adjustments to other studies. This was the case for the following analysis groups:</P>
<UL>
<LI>neonatal mortality, an ICC of 0.0012 was used from <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2008</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>breastfeeding, an ICC of 0.07 was used from <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2009</LINK>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We calculated log relative risks (RR) and standard errors (SE) of the log RR for both individual and cluster RCTs (unadjusted). We then adjusted the unadjusted SEs for cluster RCTs for the effect of clustering using the multiplicative factor square root of the design effect (= (1 + (mean cluster size-1)*ICC))<I>.</I> We analysed the log RRs for individual RCTs and the adjusted log RRs for cluster RCTs together, using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager 5. RRs were preferred to odds ratios because event rates were often high and, in these circumstances, odds ratios can be difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1998</LINK>). Random-effects model meta-analysis was preferred because the studies were heterogeneous.</P>
<P>For the remaining groups of studies (LHW interventions to provide support for mothers of sick children; to prevent or reduce child abuse; to promote parent-child interaction and health promotion; and to support women with a higher risk of low birthweight babies or other poor outcomes in pregnancy), the outcomes assessed and the settings in which the studies were conducted were very diverse. Consequently, we judged it inappropriate to combine the results of included studies quantitatively given that an overall estimate of effect would have little practical meaning. A descriptive review of these subgroups is presented in the results section below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>During the review process, we identified several factors that might explain heterogeneity. These included: characteristics of the participants and intervention setting (child immunisation uptake); risk of bias in included studies (child mortality); and characteristics of the intervention and comparator (cure for smear positive TB patients). These were undertaken as exploratory, hypothesis generating analyses since these factors were not identified a priori and a number of potential explanatory factors were considered.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Results of the search</HEADING>
<P>A total of 9705 titles and abstracts (excluding duplicates), written in English and other languages, was identified. We considered 526 full text papers for inclusion in this review, 89 of which met our inclusion criteria. When combined with the RCTs included in the last review (43 in total), a total of 132 trials were eligible for inclusion in this review update.</P>
<P>Given the very large number of studies eligible for inclusion in this review update, a decision was taken to split the updated review into two parts. This review includes all studies relevant to maternal and child health (MCH) and infectious diseases. A separate review (forthcoming) will include the following health issues: cancer screening; chronic diseases management including diabetes, mental illness and hypertension; and studies focusing on care of the elderly. This review, therefore, includes a total of 82 studies (including 21 from the original review) that are relevant to MCH and infectious diseases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Of the 82 studies included in this review, 55 studies (67%) were conducted in six high income countries: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. Forty-one of the 82 studies were conducted in the USA. Twelve studies (14.6%) were conducted in eight middle income countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Philipines, Thailand, Turkey, and South Africa). Fifteen trials (18.3%) were from 10 low income countries (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Jamaica, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Vietnam). These assignments are based on the World Bank's classification of countries by gross national income per capita in 2008.</P>
<P>In 59 studies the intervention was delivered to patients based in their homes. Five interventions were based solely in a primary care facility (<LINK REF="STD-Chaisson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaisson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caulfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Caulfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merewood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Merewood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olds-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zaman 2008</LINK>). A further eight studies involved a combination of home, primary care, and community-based interventions. Four studies delivered the intervention mainly by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graffy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1999</LINK>), while one implemented the intervention through community meetings (<LINK REF="STD-Manandhar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manandhar 2004</LINK>). For five studies, other sites were used such as the workplace, churches, or homeless shelters.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Objective of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>The objectives of the interventions varied greatly and are discussed in more detail for each group of studies in the '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>' section below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Mode of delivery</HEADING>
<P>There was great variety in the mode of intervention delivery adopted in different studies. Some trials used very specific delivery techniques that were tailored to the individual recipient, while other intervention delivery approaches were far less specific. LHWs carried out home visits in many of the trials. In other trials, interventions were delivered through telephone calls and postcards; at community meetings; or during the recipient's visit to a healthcare centre. For more information, please see the description provided for each group of studies under '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The involvement of recipients in the interventions was generally poorly described in the included studies. The most common form of involvement was the recruitment of people who had experienced a particular health condition to deliver the intervention to others who had the health condition. Few studies recorded that recipients or community members had been involved in the selection of LHWs. However, a number of trials recruited LHWs from participant communities, often to represent its demographic characteristics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Lay health workers</HEADING>
<P>Few studies documented the number of LHWs delivering care. Where this was reported, there were considerable differences in numbers. These ranged from two LHWs in Graham (1992) and Schuler (2000) to 150 LHWs in Chongsuvivatwong (1996).</P>
<P>It was difficult to group the studies in terms of either LHW selection or training because of a lack of information about these aspects in the trial reports. In some cases, individuals had been recruited for their familiarity with a target community or because of their experience of a particular health condition. </P>
<P>The level of education of the LHWs was often poorly reported but appears to have been very varied. Data on the duration of training received indicated a range of 0.4 to 146 days. The longest period (146 days) included six months of practical field training. The training approaches varied greatly between studies and were not described in the same level of detail in all of them. The terms used included: courses, classes, seminars, sessions, workshops, reading, discussion groups, meetings, role play, practical training, field work, video-taped interviews, and in-class practice.</P>

<P>LHWs have been employed to deliver a wide range of interventions in many healthcare settings. Attempting to group studies by intervention type is therefore problematic; a more useful approach is to focus on the intended outcome or objective of each study. In this review, trials have been arranged into groups, each containing studies that used broadly similar methods to influence a single health care outcome or a group of closely related outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed for four of the groups. In the majority of cases the analysis included the primary study outcome. Forest plots and GRADE tables for all meta-analyses conducted are referenced below.</P>
<P>For the remaining groups, we considered the outcomes too diverse to be pooled usefully. The outcomes for studies not included in the meta-analyses are reported briefly in the text and in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (for studies that could not be assigned to groups).</P>

Apart from Wang 2007, conducted in a rural population, all other studies were implemented among urban communities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Recipients: all studies were conducted among populations of low socioeconomic status. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Krieger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 2000</LINK>) was directed at an adult population (over 65 years of age). All other studies were directed at children of different age groups under five years.  </P>
<P>LHWs: Krieger (2000) utilised peers selected from senior centres. In all other studies the LHWs were volunteers serving as outreach, village-based workers or home visitors and recruited from the community. Information on educational background was available from three studies and indicated that the LHWs were college educated (<LINK REF="STD-LeBaron-2004" TYPE="STUDY">LeBaron 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodewald-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodewald 1999</LINK>) or primary school graduates (<LINK REF="STD-Gokcay-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcay 1993</LINK>). Only four studies provided specific information related to training: in Johnson (1993), LHWs were trained for four weeks on early childhood development principles, while Krieger (2000) reported training for only four hours. Both studies indicated that monitoring during implementation was provided. In Gockay (1993), LHWs were trained for three weeks on MCH, communication skills and on tasks to be undertaken during home visits. In Colombo 1979, coordinators were enrolled in a neighbouring college for education and training on communication skills, health care and education concepts over a six month period. Five studies indicated that monitoring or supervision was provided by a professional person but the methods used to monitor or evaluate delivery of the intervention were not specified.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Immunization uptake was the primary goal in five of the studies. In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krieger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LeBaron-2004" TYPE="STUDY">LeBaron 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodewald-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodewald 1999</LINK>) LHWs were used to encourage individuals whose immunisation schedules were not up to date, or who had not received any vaccinations, to attend clinics to be vaccinated. This was done through postcards; phone calls or home visits, or both. In Wang (2007), LHWs delivered a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine through a home visit to babies born in rural areas, using an out-of-cold chain delivery strategy. This intervention was compared to both hospital delivered vaccine and vaccine delivered using a prefilled injection device. In the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gokcay-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcay 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1993</LINK>) immunization uptake was one of several goals tied to child health and development. Here, families were visited at home by the LHW and were given guidance and information about child health, including immunization, and were encouraged to get their children vaccinated at a clinic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results</HEADING>
<P>Data from six studies on the outcome 'immunisation schedule up to date' were included in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This showed evidence of moderate quality that LHWs can increase the proportion of children with immunisation schedule up to date (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38; P = 0.0006), but the results were heterogeneous ( I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 70%, P = 0.005). In a post hoc analysis, we excluded Krieger (2000), a study focusing on adults, and Gokcay (1993), which had been implemented in a very different setting to the other studies (that is a middle rather than a high income country) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The subsequent findings indicate that LHW-based promotion strategies can increase immunisation uptake in children (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.37; P = 0.0004). The control group risk was 47.4% (range 30% to 72%). However, the results were still heterogeneous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%, P = 0.07) suggesting that LHW interventions have variable effects. No compelling explanation for this heterogeneity was identified. In addition, there is only indirect data (from high income countries and one middle income country) regarding the effects of LHW interventions to promote immunization uptake in low income countries.</P>
<P>Two studies were not included in the meta-analysis: Colombo 1979 did not provide sufficient data while Wang 2007 was different in intent to the other included studies (see above) and therefore measured different outcomes. Results from these two studies showed LHW interventions to have positive effects on immunization outcomes. In Colombo 1979, the subgroup for which outreach workers were specially trained to focus on preventive procedures for preschool children had markedly higher use rates for preventive care, such as immunization, when compared to the control group who received only routine care. In Wang 2007, coverage of the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine increased in all three groups. There was a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference between each of the groups in favour of the LHW interventions.      </P>

Aside from Jump 2006, all were community-level interventions among rural or urban populations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Recipients: these interventions targeted families of low socioeconomic status with children aged zero to five years. Jump 2003 was conducted among infants in an orphanage.</P>
<P>LHWs: these were nominated by village health committees or leaders in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Manandhar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manandhar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pence 2005</LINK>) and by community members in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kidane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kidane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouyate-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kouyate 2008</LINK>). In Baqui 2008, LHWs were selected by a partner NGO while, in Sloan 2008, they were employees of the government&#8217;s nutrition programme. The LHWs in Jump 2006 were members of the staff of an orphanage. The education level of the LHWs was generally poorly described. In Kumar 2008, the LHWs had 12 years of education or more and, in Bari 2006, they had a minimum of 10th grade education. No information was provided on the educational background of the LHWs in the other included studies. Eight studies indicated that training was provided and this ranged from two days (<LINK REF="STD-Chongsuvivatwong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chongsuvivatwong 1996</LINK>) to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Pence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pence 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The main purpose of these interventions was to promote health or essential newborn care and, in some cases, to manage or treat illness, including acute respiratory infections (ARI), malaria, diarrhoea, malnutrition, and other illnesses during the neonatal period. In five of the studies, the main LHW tasks included visiting homes to educate mothers about ARI or malaria; early recognition of symptoms; first line management of fever by tepid sponging; treatment with anti-malarials or antibiotics; and referral of severe cases to health facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Chongsuvivatwong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chongsuvivatwong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kidane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kidane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouyate-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kouyate 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mtango-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mtango 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pence 2005</LINK>). In the Pence study (2005), education about immunization, hygiene and other childhood illnesses was also given and the LHWs distributed multi-vitamins, deworming tablets and vaccines in addition to anti-malarials and antibiotics.</P>
<P>In five studies, LHW promoted birth preparedness and essential newborn care using various strategies. The LHW interventions were initiated in the antenatal period in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bari-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bari 2006</LINK>), and included pregnancy surveillance, vitamin supplementation and promotion of birth preparedness. In the postnatal period, LHWs identifed and referred sick neonates after providing first line treatment. In Sloan 2008, the LHW promoted community-based kangaroo care. In contrast, in Kumar 2008 the focus was on the identification of newborn stakeholders at community level and the promotion of behaviour change for improved survival of newborns. This was undertaken through folk songs and discussions at community level gatherings. In Manandhar (2004), the LHWs facilitated meetings where local perinatal health problems were identified and local strategies formulated to promote maternal and child health.</P>
<P>Four studies focused on the prevention or management of diarrhoeal diseases. In Luby (2006), LHWs arranged neighbourhood meetings and provided education concerning health problems associated with hand and water contamination. LHWs provided a broad range of interventions at household level for the prevention of diarrhoea, including: bleach; hand washing; a new disinfectant for drinking water; and a new disinfectant plus hand washing. The LHWs in Sazawal 1996 managed diarrhoea and prevented malnutrition by providing zinc preparations to children with diarrhoea. Growth monitoring, nutrition education, and referral to health facilities of those who were ill or failing to gain weight were the focus of activities in Sripaipan 2002. The LHWs also conducted rehabilitation programmes and made home visits to malnourished children. In the fourth study, the LHWs were trained to provided massage therapy as part of management of diarrhoea among children staying at an orphanage (<LINK REF="STD-Jump-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jump 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results</HEADING>
<P>Data from seven studies were included in several meta-analyses (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Findings are discussed below for the main outcomes measured by the included studies: mortality among children less than five years, neonatal mortality, child morbidity, and care-seeking behaviour.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcome 1: mortality among children less than five years</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>This outcome was measured in three<I> </I>studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kidane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kidane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mtango-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mtango 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pence 2005</LINK>). The results of the meta-analysis for child mortality indicate that LHW interventions may reduce child mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.03; P = 0.07). However the evidence is of low quality (due to a wide confidence interval that includes no effect and due to a moderate risk of bias).There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, P = 0.69) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>) and the control group risk was 4.5% (range 4% to 5%). In a post hoc analysis, we excluded data from Pence (2005) from this analysis due to the measurement approach used in this study and its poor methodological quality. There was no major change in the final result (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>). In the excluded trial, the effect of LHW-delivered care compared with health professional-delivered care on child mortality was inconclusive (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.33).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcome 2: neonatal mortality</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies assessed this outcome and were included in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manandhar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manandhar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sloan 2008</LINK>). The results of the meta-analysis indicate that LHW interventions may reduce neonatal mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; P = 0.07). However the evidence is of low quality, due to a wide confidence interval that includes no effect and unexplained heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%, P = 0.003) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcome 3: child morbidity</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Seven studies measured morbidity from fever, acute respiratory infection (ARI) or diarrhoea among children under five years. When six of these studies were included in a meta-analysis there was low quality evidence of reduced morbidity in favour of the LHW interventions compared with usual care (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03). The results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 69%, P = 0.003). However, all of the studies except for one (<LINK REF="STD-Sloan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sloan 2008</LINK>: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.26) found a moderate effect. The mean control group risk was 39.8% (range 25% to 55%) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>). Luby (2006) presented insufficient raw data to allow its inclusion in this meta-analysis but did document a lower prevalence of diarrhoea among children under five in the LHW arm.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcome 4: care-seeking behaviour</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Three studies measured this outcome and were included in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>). The results suggest that LHWs may increase the likelihood of seeking care (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.05). However the evidence is of low quality, due to a wide confidence interval that includes no effect and unexplained heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> =77%, P = 0.01). The control group risk (that is the likelihood of seeking care) was 13.1% (range 4% to 26%).</P>

<P>Recipients: in five studies, the recipients were drawn from groups with higher socioeconomic status (<LINK REF="STD-Agrasada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agrasada 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graffy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muirhead-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Muirhead 2006</LINK>). Women in the other 13 studies were drawn from low income communities. The other characteristics of recipients, including parity, varied widely. Studies from LMICs focused mainly on younger mothers from low income settings.</P>
<P>LHWs: these were usually peers or volunteers selected from the community, although this was not clear in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>). In most studies, previous breastfeeding experience was a prerequisite. However, this was not the case in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 1999</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Sloan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sloan 2008</LINK>) and was unclear in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2009</LINK>). The educational background of the LHWs was not reported consistently. Where reported (n = 7 studies), this typically included at least some secondary school education. Training of the LHWs varied in terms of intensity and content and was delivered by a range of different agencies and individuals. For example, in two studies training was by board-certified lactation consultants (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>); in one study by national childbirth accredited counsellors (<LINK REF="STD-Graffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graffy 2004</LINK>); and in three studies by specialists in lactation management (<LINK REF="STD-Agrasada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agrasada 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 1999</LINK>). Duration of training varied from 2.5 hours of orientation (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2002</LINK>) to approximately 280 hours in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>). Some studies included a substantial practice period for the LHWs. For instance, LHWs in the Morrow 1999 study practised for six months in a non-study neighbourhood prior to the trial. While most programmes described some form of supervision of LHWs, the form of this varied.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most studies (n = 14) intended to promote health or offer psychosocial support for breastfeeding through the provision of counselling, education and support to mothers. The interventions in the remaining studies (n = 4) had a range of objectives including (a) reducing neonatal and infant mortality through modifying high risk newborn care practices (<LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2008</LINK>) and the use of community-based kangaroo mother care (<LINK REF="STD-Sloan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sloan 2008</LINK>); and (b) improving infant feeding practices more broadly (<LINK REF="STD-Watt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2009</LINK>). All four of these studies also included breastfeeding outcomes. </P>
<P>Most of the interventions involved face to face contact with women in their homes to promote breastfeeding. However, in one study most of the contact was at primary care facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Caulfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Caulfield 1998</LINK>); two studies delivered support mainly by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graffy 2004</LINK>); and several studies used a combination of all three of these approaches (for example <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2009</LINK>). Discussions generally focused on ways to overcome potential obstacles to breastfeeding as well as on the importance and benefits of breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding promotion had a small impact on the initiation of breastfeeding, with studies showing an aggregate RR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.61).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Recipients: LHWs provided differing kinds of support to mothers of sick children. These included mothers of children with disabilities (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weindling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weindling 2007</LINK>); with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 1996</LINK>); with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, and cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan_x002d_Bolyai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan-Bolyai 2004</LINK>); and children with non-organic failure to thrive (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1995</LINK>). Vogler 2002 was conducted among children with a high risk of developmental disabilities, for example children raised in foster care.</P>
<P>LHWs: these were largely volunteers who were parents or grandparents of children with the same or a similar chronic condition.Their education level was generally poorly described. Training received varied widely in intensity from 8 to 10 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1999</LINK>) to 50 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>) and focused on enhancing skills, such as communication and other interpersonal skills, for providing psychosocial support. Where information on supervision was provided this varied from weekly meetings with professionals conducting the study in three studies, to fortnightly meetings in one study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The interventions intended to provide psycho-social support and to promote health. Programmes were delivered both in the home and the community in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1997</LINK>). In contrast, four studies (Black 1995; Sullivan-Bolyai 2004; Vogler 2002; Weindling 2007) provided only a home-based intervention. In the Singer (1999) study, the intervention was delivered by telephone. The intensity of the interventions varied from four telephone calls over a two-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1999</LINK>) to weekly one-hour home visits over six months (<LINK REF="STD-Weindling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weindling 2007</LINK>). In addition, some studies included group events for the mother or parents (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results</HEADING>
<P>These studies measured a wide range of maternal, parent and child health outcomes using different scales and it was not possible to combine these in a meta-analysis. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan_x002d_Bolyai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan-Bolyai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weindling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weindling 2007</LINK>) reported maternal health outcomes following interventions to provide support for mothers of sick children. Of these, two (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1997</LINK>) found maternal anxiety to be lower in the intervention group, but this was the only significant outcome of many reported. The same two studies also reported child mental health scores. Three scores (hostility; anxiety or depression; summary score of mental health) favoured the intervention group in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ireys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ireys 2001</LINK>). Other differences were not significant. Weindling 2007 reported only small effects on family needs and parental stress and no effect on the development of children with cerebral palsy. In Sullivan-Bolyai 2004, parent-mentored mothers had a significantly greater reduction in diabetes-related concerns and perceived the impact of illness on the family as less negative over time.</P>
<P>Black (1995) reported a large number of child growth and development outcomes. No differences between the intervention and control groups were found for growth outcomes. However, outcomes measuring cognitive development, motor development, task engagement and negative affect showed significant differences in favour of the intervention group. Other differences in developmental measures were not significant. Singer (1999) reported four outcome measures: of these, scores for parental acceptance of family and disability and the extent to which primary needs were met favoured the intervention group. However, measures of empowerment showed no significant differences between intervention and control. Scores on the parental coping measure favoured the intervention, but only for parents who entered the study with low perceived coping skills.</P>
<P>Vogler 2002 reported outcomes measuring initiation and completion rates among children at risk for developmental delay. Children who received paraprofessional intensive case management had reduced time to completion of assessments or educational plans, and increased recommendation and initiation of needed services, compared to the group receiving basic case management.</P>
<P>Due to the heterogeneity of settings, interventions, and outcomes, it was not possible to draw robust, overall conclusions regarding the effects of LHWs providing support to mothers of sick children, compared with usual care. However, there were some suggestions of small benefits for child health and development. </P>

</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Recipients: these were families at risk of child abuse and included mothers who were teenagers or those below 20 years (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 2001</LINK>); single mothers; those physically abused by their partners; mothers coping with situational crises; or mothers addicted to drugs and alcohol. Most of these families were of low socioeconomic status.</P>
<P>LHWs: only five studies provided some information on the background of the LHW. These were mainly mothers who were familiar with the community in which they worked and had a high school (n = 2), college level (n = 2), or undergraduate (n = 1) education. The training received was not well described. In Siegel 1980, training was for 60 days, including classroom teaching and field work, and focused on parent child interaction, child development, play and stimulation among others. In Barth 1991, training was over approximately 17 days and focused on the perinatal period, community resources, child abuse and reporting, as well as team building. The level of supervision provided varied from weekly meetings (n = 3), to twice weekly meetings for three hours for the first six months of the project in one study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>All the interventions involved some form of home visitation to provide support to parents. In Barth (1991) and Steven-Simons (2000), the interventions included both pre- and postnatal contact with LHWs whereas postnatal contact only was provided in <LINK REF="STD-Duggan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duggan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1980</LINK>. All attempted to assist parents in solving problems or dealing with stresses or crises and several also tried to improve access to or referral to local services (<LINK REF="STD-Duggan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duggan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results</HEADING>
<P>Most studies measured a wide range of healthcare behaviour, health status and social development outcomes and a meta-analysis of these outcomes was therefore not useful. Three of the studies reported outcomes favouring the intervention group for measures of child abuse or neglect. Bugental (2002) showed a decrease in harsh parenting and in physical abuse in the cognitive appraisal group while Stevens-Simon (2000) reported a decrease in the number of children removed due to child neglect in the intervention group compared with the control group. Hardy 1989 showed reduced child neglect, abuse, illnesses, hospitalisations, and improved compliance with well child care among the visited group, compared to the control group. The remaining studies showed no difference between the intervention and control groups for measures of child abuse. However, Duggan (2004) reported that, in families receiving a high dose of the intervention only, significant differences in favour of the intervention were measured for maternal problem alcohol use and physical abuse of women by partners. Stevens-Simon (2000) also reported a significant increase in the use of a reliable form of hormonal contraception in the intervention group compared with control.</P>
<P>Given the range of outcomes measured and high loss to follow up in these studies, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the overall effectiveness of LHWs to reduce physical abuse among children.    <BR/>

<P>Recipients: of the 10 studies, seven examined LHW support for pregnant women who were at risk of poor perinatal outcomes. Most women came from low income groups and were young, single mothers with low education levels. The included women were at high risk of giving birth to a low birthweight baby, as identified through a screening process (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1989</LINK>). In Rohr 2004, women had phenylketonuria and were pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Women at less than 20 weeks gestation and who were smoking more than one half a pack of cigarettes per day at baseline were the focus of the study by Bullock 1995. In Kartin 2002, the participating mothers used alcohol and drugs heavily during pregnancy. In the Barnett 1985 study, the included women were highly anxious primiparous mothers. Women whose babies were failing to thrive were included in Black 1995, while Tough 2006 included women who were healthy and of reasonable socioeconomic status and was intended to document the characteristics of women who opt out of prenatal care.</P>
<P>LHWs: these were mainly mothers who had good interpersonal skills or experienced mothers able to provide support to others. In Rohr 2004, these were mothers whose children had the same condition as the recipient, had similar adverse events to the recipients and functioned as a positive role model (<LINK REF="STD-Kartin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kartin 2002</LINK>). In Malchodi 2003, they were non-smoking women with similar social-environmental and cultural qualities as the participants. Apart from Gradner 2003, where LHWs had at least four years of secondary education, no other studies provided information on the educational background of the LHW. Training was generally poorly described but tended to focus on aspects specific to the condition of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malchodi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Malchodi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohr 2004</LINK>). Training also focused on motivational counselling in Malchodi 2003 and on communication skills in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tough-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tough 2006</LINK>). Limited information was available on the length of training provided and this ranged from one day in Malchodi 2003 to four days in Black 1995. Supervision was generally poorly described.</P>

<P>All 10 studies involved the provision of psychosocial support to pregnant and postnatal women. In addition, LHWs provided help with daily tasks (<LINK REF="STD-Rohr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tough-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tough 2006</LINK>) and with obtaining benefits, including housing (<LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1989</LINK>). Graham 1992 provided health education and information on pregnancy health risks, antenatal care, and childbirth; while Spencer 1989 and Kartin 2002 promoted the appropriate use of health and social services. The study by Malchodi 2003 used non-smoking women as LHWs to reinforce the anti-smoking information and to support quitting efforts. In Black 1995, the LHWs identified family needs and then worked with mothers to develop an individualised plan of support. This was focused on interaction between mothers and their children so as to aid these children&#8217;s development.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results</HEADING>
<P>For both Graham 1992 and Spencer 1989, no differences were seen in the proportion of low birthweight babies born to high risk mothers in the LHW group, compared with control. In Graham, women in the intervention group showed a higher frequency of clinic attendance, and a dose response relationship with the number of LHW visits was noted. Spencer measured a large number of birth-related outcomes, none of which showed significant differences between intervention and control. Similarly, Rohr 2004 measured a number of birth and maternal metabolic outcomes but did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in these measures between intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Malchodi 2003 found that, after controlling for baseline smoking rates, peer support by LHWs reduced the number of reported cigarettes smoked compared to usual care, especially among those that smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day. Bullock 1995 reported that women in the intervention group had decreased stress levels, higher self esteem, and reduced depressed mood in late pregnancy (34 weeks) when compared to the control group. The intervention did not, however, have an effect on smoking behaviour or drug use.</P>
<P>Barnett 1985 divided participants into high, moderate and low anxiety groups at baseline. For the high anxiety group, a significant difference in linear trend was found between the professional intervention and the control group for one measure of anxiety. No differences in linear trend were found between the LHW intervention and the control group for this measure. Direct comparisons of the professional and LHW groups were not reported for any of the groups (high, moderate, or low anxiety). Tough 2006 found no differences in the rates of completion of prenatal care by intervention arm.</P>
<P>Home visitation by lay advocates, the focus of the Kartin (2002) study, did not effectively influence the developmental abilities of children exposed to alcohol and drugs prenatally. However, Gardner 2003 documented a positive effect on problem solving and behaviour (cooperativeness and happiness) among low birthweight term babies whose mothers received LHW support, compared to low birthweight controls. Simiarly, lay home visitation in Black 1995 had a positive effect on infant cognitive and receptive language as well as on the home environment as compared to the control group.</P>
<P>Overall, these studies suggest that LHW interventions may not be useful in reducing the frequency of low birthweight babies in women at higher risk but may have an effect on children's development when implemented in the early postnatal period. <B>

<P>Eight TB studies were included in this subgroup (<LINK REF="STD-Chaisson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaisson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malotte-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malotte 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>). One additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Wohl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wohl 2006</LINK>) that evaluated LHW directly observed therapy (DOT) for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) was included in this group because of its focus on adherence support and the close relations between TB and HIV in most settings. Four studies were conducted in low and middle income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>) and the remaining five studies in high income settings.

All but one of the studies were conducted in low income communities (this was unclear for Morisky 2001 although most participants were immigrants).</P>
<P>LHWs: in several studies, the LHWs were peers or people who had recently completed TB treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chaisson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaisson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>). In the remaining studies the LHWs were individuals from the local district (<LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>) or no information was provided (<LINK REF="STD-Malotte-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malotte 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wohl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wohl 2006</LINK>). In both Clarke (2005) and Lwilla (2003), recipients participated in the selection of the LHWs. None of the studies provided information on the educational background of the LHWs. The training received was described in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chaisson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaisson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>). For example, in Clarke 2005 training consisted of 25 hours per week and focused on TB, primary health care, and community development principles. This training was conducted by a nurse and two LHW trainers. In Zwarenstein 2000, five mornings of interactive health promotion were delivered by a nurse who was also the project leader. Most studies also described specific supervision and monitoring of the LHWs, often by TB programme staff.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>All interventions provided some form of adherence support to people with TB or HIV, although this was fairly varied and included LHW DOT, LHW support for self-administration of treatment, LHW recall of patients who appeared to be non-adherent to treatment and LHW support for clinic attendance.</P>
<P>In several studies, the LHWs supervised DOT for people on TB treatment or prophylaxis, or ART (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malotte-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malotte 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wohl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wohl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>) and this was generally compared to institution-based therapy that would typically be supervised by a nurse, or to self-supervision. Other tasks implemented by the LHWs included follow up of patients who had failed to adhere to treatment (for example <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>); referral of patients with TB-like symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>); and, in the study by Lwilla (2003), the provision of drug refills. The intervention generally involved face to face contact with patients in their own homes, in the homes of LHWs, or in a community venue. Three studies from the USA also examined the additional effects on treatment adherence of an incentive (<LINK REF="STD-Malotte-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malotte 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>). These included an item agreed by parent and adolescent (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>); USD 5 per treatment visit (<LINK REF="STD-Malotte-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malotte 2001</LINK>); and USD 5 per biweekly treatment visit (<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcomes measured focused mainly on healthcare behaviours (various measures of adherence to treatment or clinic appointment keeping) and health status (various measures of TB treatment including smear conversion, treatment success, and death). In addition, Wohl 2006 assessed a number of serological measures of HIV suppression, including viral load and CD4 count.<BR/>

<P>Data from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>) were included in a meta-analysis. This showed moderate quality evidence that LHWs have a small impact on cure rates for smear positive TB patients (new and retreatment) (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31). The control group risk range was 41% to 75%.

Because Clarke 2005 and Mohan 2003 assessed interventions and comparisons that could be considered different to those of the other two studies (Clarke compared LHW supported DOT to self-supervision rather than to clinic-based DOT, while Mohan examined LHW visits to find treatment defaulters compared to no visits), we repeated the analysis after removing these studies. This showed inconclusive evidence of the effects of LHWs on cure rates for smear positive TB patients (new and retreatment) (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46), with little heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 22%, P = 0.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-17" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 17</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>) reported cure rates for new smear positive TB patients. Because the interventions and comparisons assessed by these studies differed, a meta-analysis was not conducted. Clarke 2005 compared LHW supported DOT in the community with self-supervision of treatment in the community and found that the effects of LHW support were inconclusive (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.53). Mohan 2003 compared LHW visits to locate TB treatment defaulters with no visits and found an effect on cure rates in favour of the LHW intervention (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.34) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>

Because the interventions and comparisons assessed by these studies differed, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The interventions and comparisons for Clarke 2005 and Mogan 2003 are described above. Clarke 2005 found that the effects of LHW support were inconclusive (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.27) while Mohan 2003 found an effect in favour of the LHW intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13, 1.34). The Zwarenstein 2000 trial compared LHW supervision of DOT in the community with clinic-based DOT and found inconclusive effects of LHW supervised DOT (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.71) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four studies examined the effects of LHW support for completing preventive therapy with isoniazid.

These studies assessed LHW supported self-supervision compared with self-supervision without LHW support. There was evidence, of moderate quality, that this support had little or no effect on the completion of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-15 18:15:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified 82 RCTs evaluating the effects of LHW interventions for maternal and child health and the management of infectious diseases in primary and community health care. The diversity of included studies limited meta-analysis to outcomes for four study groups. These analyses show evidence of moderate quality of the effectiveness of LHWs in promoting immunisation uptake in children; increasing breastfeeding; and improving TB cure rates, when compared to usual care. There was moderate quality evidence that LHW support had little or no effect on TB preventive treatment completion. There was also low quality evidence of the effectiveness of LHWs in reducing child morbidity; in reducing child and neonatal mortality; and in increasing the likelihood of seeking care for childhood illness. For other health issues, evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effects of LHWs. There is also insufficient evidence to determine which LHW training or intervention strategies are likely to be most effective.</P>
<P>The addition of new studies has led to differences in the results compared with those presented in the original review, as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Meta-analysis findings now suggest that people with smear positive TB receiving LHW support are more likely to be cured than those receiving other forms of treatment delivery or support. However, LHW supported self-supervision or DOT does not appear to be more effective than self-supervision for completion of TB preventive therapy. In the original review, there were insufficient studies to conduct meta-analyses for these outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Meta-analysis has now been conducted separately on studies on child and neonatal mortality. The findings suggest that LHW interventions may be effective in reducing both child and neonatal mortality, although the quality of evidence is low. The original analysis suggested that LHWs were effective in reducing child mortality as well as mortality and morbidity combined. This difference is a result of changes in the way in which the studies have been analysed.</LI>
<LI>Meta-analysis findings suggest that LHW interventions are effective in increasing the initiation of breastfeeding as well as any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding. For the last outcome, the effect size is large. The original review did not separately examine outcomes for the initiation of breastfeeding, any breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding. The new findings corroborate those of another Cochrane review focusing on the effectiveness of different forms of support for breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2007</LINK>).</LI>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-16 12:04:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When extrapolating the meta-analysis findings to large scale programmes, the following issues need to be considered. Firstly, LHWs in experimental studies may be more carefully selected; receive substantial training and support from highly motivated project leaders; and work with carefully selected recipient groups. Secondly, the review does not assess the sustainability of the effects of LHW interventions. Most trials have relatively short follow-up periods and may involve higher levels of support and supervision than may be available in non-experimental settings. These factors may be important to the long term success and sustainability of large routine LHW programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch_x002d_Capblanch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch-Capblanch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermann 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walt 1989</LINK>). Reviews including other study designs may be necessary to address the question of sustainability (for example <LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2007</LINK>). Thirdly, few studies described how LHW-provided services linked with other health system components, such as referral systems. This might create difficulties or at least uncertainties for scaling up. As others have noted, the success of task shifting to LHWs, or the extension of services using LHWs, depends in part on the embedding of such programmes within broader health system strengthening initiatives (<LINK REF="REF-Darmstadt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darmstadt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the text below, we outline a number of other considerations regarding the applicability of the evidence presented in this review.</P>
<P>Because the number of studies in each analysis subgroup was small, and the interventions were often poorly described, it was not possible to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>explore differential effects across different socioeconomic settings;</LI>
<LI>examine the impact of different forms of LHW training and support, and different intensities of intervention, on outcomes;</LI>
<LI>examine the impact of different forms of LHW incentives and payment on programme outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharyya-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharyya 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glenton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenton 2010</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>explore the inter-relationships between different elements of these complex interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2009</LINK>), which may include provision of information, support, and treatment by LHWs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Information on these relationships would help those designing LHW programmes. Inadequate intervention descriptions also make difficult the development of a typology of LHW training interventions, which could be useful for grouping studies for analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies included in this review did not always compare LHW interventions with similar services delivered by professionals (substitution). Instead, many interventions involved LHWs being used as an extension of usual care, which was often described poorly and in some cases appeared to be no care. The studies comparing LHW programmes with similar services delivered by professionals (for example <LINK REF="STD-Black-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olds-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pence 2005</LINK>) presented mixed findings, with different outcomes favouring either professional or LHW interventions. It is possible therefore that replacing professionals with LHWs may, in some circumstances, do harm rather than good, and this should be considered more carefully in future studies. We would suggest that the available data allow no overall conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of LHWs in substituting for professional providers. </P>
<P>Few studies reported cost data. Examples of such reported information include the marginal costs per additional person immunized (<LINK REF="STD-Krieger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 2000</LINK>); the cost effectiveness of community postnatal support workers (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>); and the costs of a programme to improve MCH (<LINK REF="STD-Olds-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 2002</LINK>). LHWs could potentially reduce the costs of health care if substituted for professionals, through lower costs of training and remuneration. LHWs may also reduce costs for health services users by providing care at a level closer to their home or workplace. However, as others have noted, there is a conspicuous lack of data on the cost effectiveness of such interventions across different settings (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2005</LINK>). For example, a recent systematic review of the cost effectiveness of LHW interventions for vaccination promotion and delivery identified few relevant studies (<LINK REF="REF-Corluka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corluka 2009</LINK>). In this review, we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the cost of LHW interventions compared to similar interventions delivered by health professionals.</P>
<P>Most of the studies included in this review did not report on the possible harms or adverse effects of these interventions, either to individual patients or the health system. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions regarding the trade-off between benefits and harms (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 2009</LINK>). The key determinants for harms are likely to be the extent to which LHWs provide inappropriate care (or do not provide care where needed), make inappropriate referrals or otherwise use resources inappropriately. The benefits are also likely to vary according to the focus of the intervention, the setting in which it is implemented, and other services provided within the health system.</P>
<P>Few studies reported involving local people in the development of the interventions, the selection of LHWs, or the support of the LHW programmes and we, therefore, could not assess the impacts of such involvement on intervention effectiveness. Other systematic reviews of the participation of citizens in decision making for healthcare delivery have shown some benefits, but include few studies from LMIC settings (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A substantial proportion of the included studies (33%, n = 27) were conducted in LMICs or were directed at low income groups in high income countries. Based on the premise that low income groups across different countries share similar constraints in accessing health care, it may be concluded that these interventions could potentially be extrapolated to other settings, be effective in reaching low income groups, and contribute to reducing health inequalities. However, the degree to which the findings from studies in high income settings can be generalised to low income settings remains unclear and requires further empirical research. This is a particularly important consideration in the context of the two subgroups (LHWs providing support to mothers of sick children; and LHWs to prevent child abuse), where all of the studies were conducted in the United States. Given the high socioeconomic diversity within the USA, generalisation may well be possible, but using such location-specific research findings as a basis for programmes in other settings should be undertaken with caution.</P>
<P>Factors that need to be considered in assessing whether the effects of LHW programmes, as outlined above, are likely to be transferable to other settings with different systems of health care delivery include (<LINK REF="REF-Lavis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavis 2009</LINK>) the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Whether the studies from which the evidence was drawn were conducted in similar settings to that in which the implementation decision is being taken.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Whether there are important differences in on-the-ground realities and constraints that might substantially alter the feasibility and acceptability of a LHW programme, compared to the sites in which the studies were done. For example, whether there is financial and political support for LHW programmes, including support (or resistance) from health professional organizations and service users. Also whether there are sufficient resources to provide ongoing clinical and managerial support for LHWs; to ensure the availability of supplies and equipment, such as drugs and vaccines; and to provide access to referral centres (for example for those at risk of child abuse, needing treatment for childhood illnesses, or requiring developmental assessment).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Whether there are important differences in health system arrangements that may mean that a LHW programme could not work in the same way as in the sites in which the studies were conducted. For example, if there are comparable mechanisms for employing and remunerating LHWs within the health system in the implementation setting.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Whether there are important differences in the baseline conditions between where the studies were done and the implementation setting. For example, if the incidence of TB is much lower than in the study settings, perhaps making it less cost effective to employ LHWs to support TB patients.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The availability of routine data on who might benefit from the intervention (for example children whose immunization is not up to date). These data are needed to target these programmes towards the areas of greatest need.</LI>
</UL>
<P>At present, detailed information on the trial settings and interventions is often not available in trial reports, making it difficult to assess the transferability of the results across different settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-07 02:44:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review includes 82 RCTs covering a wide range of interventions and settings. For studies included in the meta-analyses the evidence was of low to moderate quality as assessed using GRADE.</P>
<P>Assessment of risk of bias in the studies included in the review suggests concerns regarding insufficient information on sequence generation and allocation concealment and regarding the failure to address adequately incomplete outcome data. A number of the studies were small and were probably underpowered. Where meta-analysis was possible, the results were fairly consistent in showing improvements in favour of the LHW interventions, although for some interventions and outcomes there was important variation in the reported effects that could not be explained.</P>
<P>Some studies assessed large numbers of outcomes, increasing the probability of finding statistically significant differences for some outcomes by chance. Furthermore, the diversity of the psychometric and other outcome measures used made statistical pooling of outcome data difficult. An additional concern was the failure of a number of cluster randomised studies to adjust for clustering (resulting in misleadingly low P values and narrow CIs).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-06 06:11:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Firstly, LHW RCTs remain poorly indexed in electronic databases. For example, a very large number of terms are used in the literature to describe LHWs; we identified over 40 such terms in the course of this review. It is therefore possible that, despite the very extensive searches undertaken, some relevant RCTs were not identified. Most of the meta-analyses included too few studies to allow for a meaningful assessment of assymetry that might potentially suggest publication bias. However, many of the included trials reported results that were statistically non-significant and the studies were conducted by a wide range of investigators, so there are not specific reasons for suspecting a high risk of publication bias.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is no single widely accepted definition of this cadre of health workers (<LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Love-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Love 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witmer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witmer 1995</LINK>) and some readers may disagree with the inclusion decisions made. Furthermore, applying any definition to published studies is difficult as many studies do not describe adequately the training and background of the included health workers.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the meta-analysis findings need to be interpreted with caution. The results were heterogenous for several analyses and the explanations for this remain unclear. This is in part because the small number of studies in some analyses does not allow us to meaningfully explore the reasons for the heterogeneity, examine differential effects across different socioeconomic settings, or other factors.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-15 18:22:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-15 18:22:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence of the effectiveness of LHWs in promoting immunisation uptake in children; increasing breastfeeding; and improving TB cure rates, when compared to usual care. There is also low quality evidence of the effectiveness of LHWs in reducing child morbidity; in reducing child and neonatal mortality; and in increasing the likelihood of seeking care for childhood illness. Health planners could consider including LHW interventions as components of health service strategies in these areas.</P>
<P>For other health issues, evidence is insufficient so far to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of LHW interventions. There is also insufficient evidence to determine which LHW training or intervention strategies are likely to be most effective. However, LHWs are most likely to be useful as a cadre of healthcare providers when they have an effective healthcare intervention that they are able to deliver appropriately. LHWs could also potentially reduce the direct and indirect costs of health care if substituted for professionals, through reduced training and remuneration costs and by providing care at a level closer to people&#8217;s homes. However, evidence for this is currently weak.</P>
<P>When LHWs are used either to substitute for professionals (task shifting) or to extend services for a range of purposes, such as the delivery of treatment support for people with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermann 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loewenson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loewenson 2004</LINK>), policy makers, funders, and researchers should be aware of the need to rigorously evaluate these programmes given important uncertainties regarding their effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-07 02:46:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The large number of trials, from a wide range of settings, of LHW programmes in maternal and child health and infectious diseases indicates the feasibility and value of rigorous evaluations and the potential for LHWs to have important benefits for a range of health issues. The implications for research are organised into key messages for trialists, systematic review authors, and other researchers.</P>
<P>
<B>Trialists</B>
</P>
<P>For health issues where LHW interventions demonstrate benefits, such as the support of breastfeeding women, research needs to shift to understanding which components of these often multi-faceted interventions are most effective. Trials of head to head comparisons of LHW programmes may contribute to addressing this question.</P>
<P>Trials are also needed of the effectiveness of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>different approaches to the (initial and ongoing) training of LHWs and the delivery of services provided by LHWs, including mechanisms for supportive supervision;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>LHWs as compared to professional healthcare providers in delivering interventions in the fields of health education, promotion, and the management of disease.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Greater attention needs to be paid to the quality of study designs, particularly where cluster randomisation is used. Also, investigators should specify a primary outcome; consider whether the measurement of large number of related outcomes is useful; describe more thoroughly the training and support strategies used, any co-interventions and health care organisation and system issues; assess possible harms of the interventions; and report findings according to the relevant CONSORT guidelines.</P>
<P>Economic studies and process evaluations (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oakley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 2006</LINK>) should also accompany trials to establish the cost effectiveness of different LHW interventions and to better understand the factors affecting their successful implementation.</P>
<P>
<B>Systematic review authors</B>
</P>
<P>Further systematic reviews, including of studies of effects, process evaluations, and economic evaluations, are needed on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>factors affecting the sustainability of LHW interventions when scaled up;</LI>
<LI>the effectiveness of different approaches to ensure programme sustainability, including the use of different kinds of incentives and payment systems for LHWs;</LI>
<LI>the cost effectiveness of LHW interventions for different health issues;</LI>
<LI>mechanisms for integrating LHW programmes into the formal health system;</LI>
<LI>the equity impacts of these programmes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Other researchers</B>
</P>
<P>Given the wide range of health issues, recipients, settings, training strategies, and delivery mechanisms for LHW interventions, there is a need for the development of a coherent typology of LHW interventions that could help to guide research and practice in this field. Such a typology might allow LHW interventions to be conceptualised in terms of their lay component rather than in terms of the specific health issues on which they focus.</P>
<P>Further research is also needed on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the effects of involving local people in the planning and support of LHW programmes;</LI>
<LI>the impacts of new technologies, such as mobile phones and uniject devices (simple, non-reusable, prefilled injection devices) on the range of tasks that LHWs can undertake effectively.</LI>

<P>1) In the original review protocol, we aimed to address the following comparisons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>LHW interventions compared to no intervention;</LI>
<LI>LHW interventions involving activities not now undertaken by health professionals and delegated to LHWs compared to no intervention;</LI>
<LI>LHW interventions involving activities not now performed adequately by health professionals and delegated to LHWs compared to no intervention;</LI>
<LI>LHW interventions involving activities now performed by health professionals but delegated to LHWs to reduce resource consumption compared to the same activities performed by health professionals;</LI>
<LI>The effectiveness of the lay health worker intervention related to intensity of training.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As the data included in published studies did not allow these comparisons to be addressed meaningfully, we have not included them in this review update.</P>
<P>2) Exclusions: where necessary, we have tailored the exclusion criteria for the review based on new configurations of interventions identified during this update. In particular, we have now excluded interventions in which the LHW was a family member trained to deliver care and provide support only to members of his or her own family (that is in which LHWs did not provide some sort of care or service to others or were unavailable to other members of the community).

<P>LHW: Prior to the start of the study, 2 mothers from the greater Hartford area, who had successfully breastfed a child for no less than 6 months and who had the motivation to help other mothers breastfeed their infants, were hired.</P>
<P>TRAINING: An international board certified lactation consultant trained these women over 2 weeks using the 40-hour World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Breastfeeding Counseling Training Course (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 1993</LINK>) and the Hispanic Health Council Breastfeeding Training Manual (<LINK REF="REF-Damio-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damio 1995</LINK>), while the exclusive breastfeeding component was handled by the study field coordinator. The training included theory (anatomy and physiology of the breast and management of breastfeeding), roleplays, and hands-on practice with mother-infant dyads, and communication skills, as well as observing the lactation consultant during routine ward rounds and home visits. The peer counselors were observed for 2 months by the lactation consultant, who assisted women with breastfeeding problems.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS: Low income predominantly Latina community. 18 yrs or older, gestation age of 32 weeks or younger, healthy and abscence of any medical condition (diabetes, hypertension, HIV/AIDS or using illegal drugs) that were likely to impair breastfeeding. To qualify for participation, the woman should have been: (1) considering breastfeeding her newborn; (2) planning to deliver at Hartford Hospital; (3) willing to stay in the study area for at least 3 months after delivery; (4) living in a household earning 185% of the federal poverty level; (5) available to be contacted by telephone; and (6) willing to participate in the study.</P>

<P>OBJECTIVE: To provide community-based peer counselling to improve exclusive breastfeeding among low-income mothers.</P>
<P>INTERVENTION: Women assigned to the peer counseling group were offered 3 prenatal home visits, 9 postpartum home visits, and daily in-hospital visits during postpartum hospitalisation, from the assigned peer counselor (in addition to the routine breastfeeding support received by the control group). During the prenatal visits, the woman was provided with an opportunity to watch a breastfeeding video. The family was also encouraged to participate in the education, especially the person expected to support the woman after delivery. The mothers could contact the counsellors by phone if they had any urgent breastfeeding problems between visits. The assigned peer counselor also visited the mother-infant pair at least once a day starting within 24 hours after delivery and continued for as long as the dyad remained hospitalised.</P>
<P>CONTROL: Women assigned to the control group only received conventional breastfeeding education prenatally<BR/>from the Women&#8217;s Ambulatory Health Services clinic staff. On delivery, they received hands-on breastfeeding assistance and education from the maternity ward nursing staff. If any of these mothers experienced breastfeeding problems requiring assistance beyond that routinely provided by staff nurses, the hospital&#8217;s lactation consultant on duty was called to assist the patient.<BR/>MODE OF DELIVERY: Counsellors contacted mother within a week of assignment to make an appointment for the first pre-natal home visit. In addition to visits, telephone support was also available.<BR/>RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT IN SELECTION/TRAINING/MANAGEMENT: not described.<BR/>GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING: urban formal, USA<BR/>HEALTHCARE SETTING: home.</P>

<P>LHW: Peer counsellors in this programme were community women who have (1) completed high school, (2) breastfed a child for a minimum of 6 months, and (3) been trained in breastfeeding management. They were recruited through job postings at the participating hospital and the Hispanic Health Council, through contact with clients who have successfully breastfed, and by word of mouth. Preference was given to candidates who were bilingual, were enthusiastic about breastfeeding, were flexible regarding scheduling, and had a mature, positive demeanour. At least one of the peer counsellors was bilingual and of Puerto Rican background.</P>
<P>TRAINING: Peer counsellors receive 30 hours of classroom training from the program coordinator, using the combined curricula of the La Leche League International Peer Counseling Programme and the Hispanic Health Council's 'Breastfeeding: Heritage and Pride' peer counselling programme. They then spend 3 to 6 months working with experienced peer counselors, gradually progressing from observation to directly managing clients under supervision. Once competence is demonstrated, peer counsellors work independently with clients. Close contact with the program coordinator is maintained through biweekly case review meetings. Each month the staff members receive 1 hour of continuing education.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria specified that women must be (1) at least 18 years old, (2) considering breastfeeding their infant, (3) residents of the greater Hartford area, (4) available for telephone follow up, (5) low income (ie, WIC participant, food stamp recipient, or household income less than 180% of federal poverty level), 6) at no more than 26 weeks gestation, and 7) not yet enrolled in the peer counselling programme. Average age = 24.8 years; average education = 11.6 years; 12.8% had US residency; 23% were married; 15.9% and 22% were employed full time and part time respectively; 80% were Hispanic, 8.5% were African American, 3.6% were White and 7.9% were other; 26.5% spoke English at home.</P>

<P>LHW: 39 'veteran mothers' or 'experienced' mothers with young adult children affected by chronic disease (diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, moderate to severe asthma and cystic fibrosis). The Network Mothers (NM) were recruited by asking directors and staff of speciality clinics to nominate suitable mothers whose affected child was 18 years or older. <BR/>TRAINING: network mothers: 30 hour training program, focusing on enhancing skills in listening, reflecting and "story swapping". Role plays, videotaped interviews, and in-class practice interviews were used. Successful graduates of the training were invited to participate in the programme and then underwent an additional 20 hours of training along with the child life specialists to reinforce the team aspects of the program and to review operational procedures. The network mothers and child life specialists met together weekly with a paediatrician and a social worker to ensure that the intervention was being delivered as planned. These meetings served to co-ordinate efforts within and across teams, address ongoing problems, and review issues related to recent or upcoming contacts or special events.<BR/>PATIENTS: Women with children aged 7 to 11 years with one of the following chronic illnesses: diabetes (40%), sickle cell anaemia (19%), cystic fibrosis (9%), moderate to severe asthma (32%). 29% were single mothers of whom 35% only had high school education or less. 70% of mothers had some form of employment.<BR/>TOTAL=161; INTERVENTION=86; CONTROL=75.</P>

<P>OBJECTIVE: to provide social support for mothers of children suffering from chronic illness.<BR/>INTERVENTION: social support from 'network mothers'.<BR/>CONTROL: mothers were given a telephone number through which they could reach an experienced parent is they so wished. The experienced parent did not go through any training and did not initiate telephone calls.<BR/>MODE OF DELIVERY: volunteer mothers performed the following tasks. 7 visits of 60 to 90 minutes to each assigned family, either alone or with the child life specialist; biweekly telephone contacts of at least 5 minutes to build and maintain support, follow up on issues previously discussed or plan future meetings; participation in 3 special events, such as bowling parties or small-group lunches that would allow program parents to meet each other in a nonstressful venue. Through these interventions, the LHWs provided 3 types of support. 1) informational support, by linking families with existing health and community resources and by sharing information among mothers about child behaviour, parenting and coping. 2) affirmational support, by enhancing a mother's confidence in parenting and by reassuring her that her concerns and issues were appropriate. 3) emotional support, by being available to listen to a parent's concerns, demonstrating a continued interest in the mother's viewpoints and experiences, and effectively communicating an understanding of the mother's feelings and concerns.<BR/>Each network mother had 1 to 7 assigned families and was paid hourly for all program-related efforts.<BR/>RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT IN DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT/DELIVERY: social support provided by mothers with older children who had previously suffered from a chronic illness.<BR/>ORGANISATIONAL BASE OF THE INTERVENTION: not described.<BR/>GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING: urban U.S.A.<BR/>HEALTHCARE SETTING: home and community.</P>

Were compensated similar to community-based workers in India (USD35-40). Also used volunteers from within the community (Saksham Karta) who played a key part in program advocacy, trust-building and social legitimisation of changes in behaviour. Mothers that received the intervention and displayed exemplary practices were promoted as role models to inspire other pregnant women in the community.</P>
<P>TRAINING: Had a 7 day training, classroom and apprenticeship-based field training on essential newborn care within the community, behaviour change management and trust building.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women from 18,989 households that were visited. Mean number of residents per household was about 5 (SD 0.3), Most were Hindu (Mean about 93, sd5.9). Mean number of literate women in reproductive age group 15 - 49 years was about 38, sd 9.7, most were married (Mean 83, SD2.4). Routine antenatal seeking behaviour was low &lt;10%, more than 90% deliveries were at home, less than 15% attended by a skilled attendant . Most had medium standard of living index as calculated by the National family Health survey method (Mean 56, SD2), roughly one third had lowest standard of living.

<P>OBJECTIVE: To assess if community-based participatory intervention could significantly reduce neonatal mortality rates.</P>
<P>CONTROL: Standard of care, but for ethical reasons health services in both intervention and control areas were strengthened by equipping PHC centres with resuscitaires, phototherapy units, warm cots, neonatal resuscitation equipment. Shortfalls in essential neonatal drugs were remedied, discussed strategies for resupply with local health-service managers. Training in essential newborn care for all cadres of government health staff, female community health volunteers and traditional birth attendants was given.</P>
<P>MODE OF DELIVERY: Local facilitators helped convene, activate and strengthen women's group meetings. Provided support through an action research cycle. This involved: discussing issues about childbirth and care behaviour with the community that allowed facilitator develop participatory learning skills and generate information on pregnancy, childbirth, beliefs and practices. Together with the women they then identified the key problems, developed strategies to overcome them. The women groups then implemented and assessed their strategies.</P>

<P>OBJECTIVE: To provide support to improve adherence to TB prophylaxis.</P>
<P>INTERVENTION 1: Participants received isoniazid with DOT by a research assistant twice a week at a site near the TB clinic and received USD5 each time. Problems were referred to a physician or the TB clinic. If a dose was missed, attempts to contact the participant were made through letters or telephone calls. The research assistants were lay persons trained by the study physicians. They were encouraged to be friendly and respectful to the participants but were explicitly discouraged from giving special assistance or medical referrals.</P>
<P>INTERVENTION 2: Each participant was introduced to a peer health advisor who was responsible for directly observed therapy of 900 mg of Isoniazide twice weekly for 6 months. Where Isoniazid was not dispensed immediately, the advisor visited the participant twice a week for a review of TB symptoms. The advisor also checked for drug side effects before administering each dose and referred these on to the clinic. Also, the advisor accompanied participants to the clinic for monthly refill appointment and searched for the participants if they missed an appointment.</P>
<P>CONTROL: TB clinic staff instructed patients who were prescribed isoniazid in daily self-administered dosing. Participants were given 1 month's supply of pills and scheduled for monthly drop-in appointments at the clinic for symptom review and pill refills. Adherence to appointments was monitored by reviewing TB clinic charts. If participants failed to return, the clinic followed a standard protocol including 3 letters or 3 telephone calls before closing the chart to further treatment. Participants were assumed to be adherent if they collected their pills monthly.</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP> Median baseline control group risk among included studies.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> In Pence 2005, only 2 clusters were randomised for this comparison and there were significant baseline imbalances. The quality of evidence was therefore downgraded for limitations in design. None of the 3 trials in this analysis adjusted adequately for clustering in the original report. After the design effect was taken into account, the CIs for the effect estimates were wider than reported in the original papers. <BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> In Kidane 2000, cause of death from malaria was obtained from verbal autopsies during a period when measles and chronic wasting were also important health problems. Some of the deaths attributed to malaria may have been due to these other causes. In addition, authors verified only 1/3 of the deaths using a second assessor who was blinded. <BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> The quality of evidence was downgraded for imprecision as the pooled estimate of effect included both no effect and appreciable benefit. The imprecision is related to the small number of clusters in Pence 2005 (2 clusters) and Kidane 2000 (24 clusters), giving a design effect of 267,7 and 12.4 for these two studies respectively.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Mtango 1986, Kidane 2000, Pence 2005.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Selected the next to lowest and next to highest control group risk.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> For all studies it is not clear whether outcome assessors were blinded or not. The reliance on verbal reporting of outcomes may have introduced reporting bias.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> There are moderate levels of heterogeneity across these studies (I2=69%, p=0.003) and the confidence intervals do not overlap for all of the studies. The reasons for this heterogeneity are not clear.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> Chongsuvivatwong 1996, Sripaipan 2002, Manandhar 2004, Sloan 2008, Kumar 2008, Kouyate 2008, Bari 2006<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> There are high levels of heterogeneity across these studies (I2=78%, p=0.003) and the confidence intervals of the studies do not overlap. The effect sizes of the studies range from no effect to a 50% relative reduction. The reasons for this heterogeneity are not clear, but may relate to differences in the length of follow up across the studies (12-24 months). <BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> The quality of evidence was downgraded for imprecision as the pooled estimate of effect included both no effect and appreciable benefit. <BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP> Baqui 2008, Kumar 2008, Manandhar 2004, Sloan 2008.<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP> There are high levels of heterogeneity across these studies (I2=77%, p=0.01) and the confidence intervals have minimal overlap. The reasons for this heterogeneity are not clear, but may relate to differences in the length of follow up across the studies (12-33 months).<BR/>
