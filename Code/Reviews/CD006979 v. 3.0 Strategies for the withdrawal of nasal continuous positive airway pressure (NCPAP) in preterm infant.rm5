<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-01 12:14:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a form of respiratory support commonly used in the treatment of preterm infants. Potential risks of NCPAP include damage to the nose and leaking of air from the lungs. Infants on NCPAP require more nursing care and the use of extra equipment. However, potential complications of removing NCPAP from babies too early include increasing episodes of forgetting to breathe, increased oxygen needs, increased effort of breathing, the need to restart NCPAP and the need for a breathing tube with mechanical ventilation. Any of these complications can be seen as a "failure" and are potentially distressing to staff and family. The best way to withdraw NCPAP once it has been started is unknown. Options include simply stopping, weaning the pressure, increasing the time off NCPAP each day or combinations of both. A recent study has suggested that stopping the NCPAP all together once compared to having periods of time off NCPAP decreases the incidence of chronic neonatal lung disease and the length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>We aimed to determine the benefits and risks of different strategies used for the withdrawal of NCPAP in preterm infants who are stable and may be ready to have NCPAP withdrawn. This review identified three studies but, due to differences in the studies and the limited data available, the results could not be combined.</P>
<P>Infants who have their NCPAP pressure weaned to a predefined level and then stop NCPAP completely have less total time on NCPAP and shorter durations of oxygen therapy and hospital stay compared with those that have NCPAP removed for a predetermined number of hours each day. Clear criteria need to be established for the definition of stability prior to attempting to withdraw NCPAP and for the definition of failure to withdraw.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:51:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a widely accepted method of respiratory support used in the care of preterm infants with a number of established risks and benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002b</LINK>). While other investigators have attempted to determine the optimal technique of CPAP delivery (<LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2002</LINK>), the best strategy for the withdrawal of NCPAP remains unknown. At what point an infant is considered stable enough to attempt to start withdrawing their NCPAP is not clearly established. The criteria for a failed attempt at NCPAP withdrawal is also not clear. In a survey of Australian and New Zealand Neonatologists, 56% stated that CPAP weaning was "ad hoc" in their units (<LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2008</LINK>). Reported criteria used for assessing the failure of coming off CPAP include an increased oxygen requirement, increased work of breathing, tachypnoea, increasing frequency and severity of apnoea, a PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 60 mmHg, pH &lt; 7.2 and bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-01-01 12:14:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Possible strategies for withdrawal of NCPAP include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stopping NCPAP completely, independent of the level of airway pressure, and remaining off NCPAP unless certain criteria are met that require the infant to go back onto NCPAP;</LI>
<LI>Decreasing NCPAP to predefined level of airway pressure, then stopping NCPAP completely;</LI>
<LI>Removing NCPAP for a predetermined number of hours each day (this can be a single time period: e.g., 4 hours off, 20 on; or a number of smaller time periods e.g., 1 hour off, 5 on) gradually increasing the amount of time off NCPAP each day until NCPAP is able to be stopped completely (graded time off);</LI>
<LI>Stopping NCPAP and starting low flow oxygen or humidified high flow air (and oxygen if required) via nasal cannula;</LI>
<LI>Combinations of the above strategies (e.g. decrease NCPAP to a defined level and then discontinuing NCPAP for a number of hours each day);</LI>
<LI>Combinations of the above strategies in addition to co-interventions (e.g. methylxanthines).</LI>
</OL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-01 12:15:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The possible benefits of different methods of NCPAP withdrawal are mostly anecdotal. Weaning the distending pressure may gradually increase respiratory muscle strength without the associated risk of atelectasis. Having periods of time off may have a similar effect of respiratory muscle training but for shorter more intense periods. Time off NCPAP may be more likely to cause "atelectotrauma" (due to alveolar collapse when off NCPAP and re-recruitment once NCPAP recommences). Having periods of time off NCPAP may reduce the incidence of nasal trauma or possibly lead to increased nasal trauma secondary to the frequent re-application of the prongs.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-01 12:15:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While an infant is on NCPAP they have a risk of nasal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Caliumi_x002d_Pelleg.-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caliumi-Pelleg. 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 1973</LINK>) and pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2007</LINK>). Another reported risk of NCPAP may be an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Han-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 1987</LINK>). Infants on NCPAP may also require more intensive nursing care and the use of extra equipment compared to those not on NCPAP. Therefore, minimising the amount of time that a patient requires NCPAP may be beneficial. Possible disadvantages of removing NCPAP too early include: increasing apnoea, increased oxygen requirement, increased work of breathing, the need to re-start NCPAP, and intubation and mechanical ventilation. Any of these complications can be seen as a "failure" and are potentially distressing to baby, family and staff.</P>
<P>Despite the paucity of evidence, the practice of weaning NCPAP is widespread. In a survey of Australian Neonatologists, 70% of respondents reported using a graded time off NCPAP weaning strategy and 74% used a weaning strategy involving decreasing airway pressure prior to coming off NCPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2008</LINK>). The approach to withdrawing NCPAP may vary depending on the clinical situation. Different strategies may be used depending on birth weight, gestational age at birth, time already spent on respiratory support, presence of chronic lung disease and gestational age of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2008</LINK>). The incidence of failure to come off NCPAP is unknown.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Todd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2010</LINK> is an ongoing study of 154 infants and some outcome measures have been reported in abstract form only. Babies were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: less than 30 weeks gestation, requiring NCPAP for over 24 hours, no congenital abnormalities, no severe IVH (Grade IV) and being treated with primary NCPAP or secondary NCPAP following extubation. Once patients had reached stability criteria, they were randomised to one of three methods of NCPAP weaning. In method one, they were taken off NCPAP. In method two, they started having periods of time off NCPAP from a minimum of 30 minutes off at a time to complete withdrawal. When they were on NCPAP they were on for six hours before their next period of time off. The clinician gradually increased the duration of the periods off NCPAP until complete withdrawal. Method three also started having periods of time off NCPAP as in method two, but when the baby was having the time off they had supplemental air or oxygen via nasal cannula at 0.5 L/min. If certain failure criteria were met, the baby was recommenced on NCPAP for at least 48 hours, stability criteria had to be met before further attempts (in originally assigned method) were undertaken.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2006</LINK> was a study of 112 infants with birth weights less than 1500 grams who were requiring less than 0.3 FiO<SUB>2</SUB> and were stable on NCPAP. Patients were then randomised to a strategy of gradual reduction of NCPAP pressure (actual methods are not described) or increasing duration of time off (actual methods are not described) NCPAP with nasal cannula and low flow oxygen. Participants were considered successfully weaned if they were off NCPAP for seven days.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Soe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Soe 2008</LINK> studied 98 preterm infants (23 to 31 weeks) who had required respiratory support for surfactant deficiency or immature lung disease. Infants were stratified according to gestational age (23 to 27 weeks or 28 to 31 weeks). Patients were then randomised into two groups. The controlled time weaning group were treated with the <I>Infant Flow Driver</I> NCPAP at 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Each day was divided into three eight-hour time periods. On day one, each time period consisted of seven hours on NCPAP and one hour off. For the next five days, the time on NCPAP was decreased daily by one hour in each period and the time off NCPAP was correspondingly increased by one hour as long as stability criteria (satisfactory gases, incubator oxygen less than 0.3, no frequent bradycardia/apnoea) were met. The pressure weaning group were treated with <I>Infant Flow Driver</I> NCPAP at 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days, then 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days and 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days. In both groups the "Not to wean NCPAP criteria" were: pH less than 7.25, FiO<SUB>2</SUB> more than 0.4, apnoea requiring IPPV, more than 1 apnoea requiring stimulation per hour, more than 5 self limiting bradycardia/apnoea episodes per hour, or a decision by an on-call registrar/nurse. If any of these criteria were met the baby did not progress to the next stage or went back a step, whichever was deemed appropriate. Infants were considered successfully weaned if they were off NCPAP for six days.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-01 12:20:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review have provided limited data about the best method of weaning NCPAP in preterm infants who are stable and may be ready to have NCPAP withdrawn.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2006</LINK> is particularly limited as it has been published only as an abstract and therefore the exact methods are not known and the available results are extremely limited. We could not tell which pressure generation device was used in this study and exactly how the withdrawal and weaning of NCPAP was done.</P>
<P>The pressure source used for NCPAP generation is known for only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Soe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Soe 2008</LINK> used the <I>Infant Flow Driver)</I>. This may be an independent confounder. The results of this study may not be generalisable to infants who are being treated with other types of NCPAP.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Soe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Soe 2008</LINK> provided stability criteria and "not to wean criteria" both of which are important when considering applying the results in practice and for future meta-analysis; no such criteria were available for <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2006</LINK>. Stability criteria and failure criteria are clearly provided in the ongoing study as described by <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2010</LINK> and if adopted by future studies, would greatly help in any further meta-analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2010</LINK> all babies initially had their NCPAP pressure reduced before randomisation. Both <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Soe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Soe 2008</LINK> compared weaning the NCPAP pressure to increasing periods of time off NCPAPbefore any attempt was made to withdraw the NCPAP. It is not known if this approach is necessary or not and should be considered as part of the weaning strategy. Although both included studies seem to favour a "weaning pressure" approach, the description of trial methods and results makes it impossible to confirm the veracity of these findings.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:54:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-06 11:54:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The currently available evidence suggests that infants who have their NCPAP pressure weaned to a predefined level and then stop NCPAP completely have less total time on NCPAP and shorter durations of oxygen therapy and hospital stay compared with those that have NCPAP removed for a predetermined number of hours each day.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-03 23:59:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is required into the best methods for withdrawal on NCPAP and to which subgroups these apply. Any future trials of withdrawing NCPAP should compare proposed strategies with weaning NCPAP pressure to a predefined level and then stopping NCPAP completely. Clear criteria for the definition of stability prior to attempting to withdraw NCPAP have been defined by <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2010</LINK>, whether or not these or other criteria are best, needs to be established.</P>

<P>In the time weaning group, on day one, each time period consisted of seven hours on NCPAP and one hour off.

<P>The pressure weaning group were treated with <I>Infant Flow Driver</I> CPAP at 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days, then 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days and 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for two days.</P>
