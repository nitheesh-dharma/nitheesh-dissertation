With this new trial, there are now two trials on peri-cervical tourniquet included in this review. The inclusion of the new trial to this review has changed the conclusions; unlike the previous versions of the review where we concluded that there is limited evidence that peri-cervical tourniquet reduce blood loss during myomectomy, the conclusion in the current updated version is that there is no evidence that peri-cervical tourniquet has an effect on blood loss.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-29 15:32:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Some women have non-cancerous growths of the uterus, called fibroids. In a third of cases the fibroids produce symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, that warrant treatment. The surgical removal of the fibroids, called myomectomy, is one of the treatment options for fibroids. It can be accomplished by either laparotomy (through an incision into the abdomen) or laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). The procedure is associated with heavy bleeding. Many interventions have been used by doctors to reduce bleeding during an operation for removing fibroids but it is unclear whether or not the interventions are effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to June 2014. The review included 18 studies with a total of 1250 women who had myomectomy for uterine fibroids. All studies compared an intervention to reduce bleeding during myomectomy with either a placebo or no such treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The data available suggest that vaginal insertion of misoprostol and infiltration of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. Limited data available also suggest that chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during surgery, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, the use of fibrin sealant patch (a surgical patch that improves blood clotting) or a tourniquet around the cervix or around both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligamentmay be effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. We found limited information on the harms (adverse effects) of the different interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol reduces blood loss by between 70.24 ml and 125.52 ml; with a laparotomy vasopressin reduces blood loss by between 392.51 and 507.49 ml during myomectomy, and by between 121.73 ml and 172.17 ml during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is low-quality evidence for the rest of the interventions (chemical dissection, dinoprostone, gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine, a fibrin sealant patch and the two types of tourniquet).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-07 15:32:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benign smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, known as fibroids or myomas, are often symptomless. However, about one-third of women with fibroids will present with symptoms that are severe enough to warrant treatment. The standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is hysterectomy (that is surgical removal of the uterus) for women who have completed childbearing, and myomectomy for women who desire future childbearing or simply want to preserve their uterus. Myomectomy, the surgical removal of myomas, can be associated with life-threatening bleeding. Excessive bleeding can necessitate emergency blood transfusion. Knowledge of the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce bleeding during myomectomy is essential to enable evidence-based clinical decisions. This is an update of the review published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2011, Issue 11).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-13 15:34:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-07 19:04:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas) are benign, smooth muscle tumours of the human uterus. Most myomas are asymptomatic (symptomless) and are discovered incidentally during a routine pelvic examination or imaging studies (<LINK REF="REF-Vollenhoven-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollenhoven 1990</LINK>). However, about 20% to 50% of women with myomas will present with symptoms severe enough to warrant treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1993</LINK>). Myomas are three times more prevalent in black women, who tend to have larger, more numerous myomas, than their white counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-Jacoby-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacoby 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas is hysterectomy for women who have completed childbearing, and myomectomy for women who wish to preserve fertility. Hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, eliminates both the symptoms and the chance of recurrence. However, many women who suffer from myomas desire future childbearing or want to preserve their uterus. For these women myomectomy, the surgical removal of the myomas with reconstruction and preservation of the uterus, is an important option. Myomectomy can be accomplished by laparotomy, laparoscopy or hysteroscopy. Myomectomy by laparotomy involves the surgical removal of the fibroids through an incision in the abdominal wall. Where there are a small number of subserous or intramural myomas and the uterine size is less than that of 16 weeks gestation, laparoscopic myomectomy may be an option (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2005</LINK>). The laparoscopic approach is a minimal access technique (keyhole surgery) developed to minimize insult to the abdominal wall and to ensure quick recovery of the patient following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hasson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasson 1992</LINK>). For women with submucous myomas, transcervical hysteroscopic resection is a good option both for the gynaecologic surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Derman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derman 1991</LINK>) and their patients.</P>
<P>Myomectomy can lead to both short and long-term complications. Complications of hysteroscopic myomectomy include haemorrhage, uterine perforation, cervical damage and metabolic disturbances from excessive absorption of the distension medium, such as glycine (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2000</LINK>). Laparoscopic myomectomy is associated with the usual risks of laparoscopy, particularly accidents during trocar (a surgical instrument) placement; and, additionally, excessive uncontrolled haemorrhage with the need to convert to a laparotomy and the risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Dubuisson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubuisson 1997</LINK>). Short-term complications of abdominal myomectomy include bleeding, fever, infection, visceral damage and thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-LaMote-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaMote 1993</LINK>). A requirement for transfusion in up to 20% of cases following abdominal myomectomy has been reported in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-LaMote-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaMote 1993</LINK>). Patients undergoing myomectomy have an unusually high incidence of fever occurring in the first 48 hours following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Iverson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iverson 1999</LINK>). The incidence of postoperative fever following myomectomy has been reported to be as high as 36% (<LINK REF="STD-Celik-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2003</LINK>). The cause is unknown but it is believed that 'myomectomy fever' is due to the release of pyrogenic (fever-inducing) factors during myoma dissection or to haematomas (blood clots) forming in defects left by the removed myomas. In 2% of cases there is a need for conversion of myomectomy to hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Aubuchon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aubuchon 2002</LINK>). Long-term complications of abdominal myomectomy include pelvic adhesions in 59% of women after two years (<LINK REF="REF-Frederick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frederick 2002</LINK>) and recurrent fibroids in 46.0% of women after one year (<LINK REF="REF-Nishiyama-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishiyama 2006</LINK>). The risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies varies between 0% and 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Garnet-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnet 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tulandi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tulandi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedele-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedele 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Somigliana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somigliana 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood loss during myomectomy can be intraoperative or postoperative and with haematoma formation. Massive blood loss associated with the dissection of huge fibroids renders myomectomy a more technically challenging procedure than hysterectomy. Sometimes myomectomy is converted to hysterectomy intraoperatively when bleeding becomes heavy and uncontrollable or when it is impossible to reconstruct the uterus because of the many defects left by the removal of multiple myomas (<LINK REF="REF-Iverson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iverson 1996</LINK>). Excessive bleeding can necessitate emergency blood transfusion.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-13 15:34:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Many interventions have been performed to reduce bleeding during myomectomy. Four categories of interventions can be identified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>interventions on uterine arteries such as laparoscopic uterine artery dissection, uterine artery embolization, peri-cervical mechanical tourniquet, vasopressin (natural or synthetic), a vasoconstrictive solution of bupivacaine plus epinephrine, and temporary clipping of the uterine artery;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>utero-tonics such as ergometrine, oxytocin, misoprostol, and sulprostone;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>myoma dissection techniques which include myoma enucleation by morcellation and the use of laser and chemical dissectors such as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (mesna);</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade with antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid, aprotinin, aminocaproic acid, recombinant factor VIIa (<LINK REF="REF-Koh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 2003</LINK>), and gelatin-thrombin haemostatic sealant.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In developed countries, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (GnRHa) have been used prior to myomectomy. There is now clear evidence that the use of GnRH analogues reduces uterine volume and fibroid size and may reduce blood loss and operating time during myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2001</LINK>). Although the use of preoperative GnRHa leads to less frequent vertical incisions in the case of myomectomy, a review of the cost-effectiveness of GnRHa found that the costs outweigh its benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>). In addition, uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been used as an alternative to myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lumsden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumsden 2002</LINK>) and to prevent haemorrhage during myomectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Ngeh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ngeh 2004</LINK>). However, there are currently no randomised trials comparing UAE with a placebo or no treatment with regard to blood loss during myomectomy. In low and middle income countries, however, the cost of using GnRH analogues and UAE may be prohibitive (especially where there is an out-of-pocket payment) and the necessary technology may not be available.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-13 15:31:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The mechanical tourniquet has been used during myomectomy to reduce intraoperative blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchins 1996</LINK>). However, the pressure exerted by the tourniquet may cause damage to the uterine artery and its branches, and mask inadequate haemostasis (arrest of bleeding), which only becomes apparent once the tourniquet is removed. Uterine artery ligation can reduce both intraoperative and postoperative haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Sapmaz-2003B" TYPE="STUDY">Sapmaz 2003B</LINK>). Hormonal tourniquets such as natural or synthetic vasopressin act on vasopressin V1a receptors, ubiquitously expressed in the myometrium, to reduce blood loss (<LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dimitrov-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimitrov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimura-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kimura 2002</LINK>). Hormonal tourniquets act as peri-cervical tourniquets when administered in the cervix but act as utero-tonics when administered in the myometrium. Preoperative UEA is a technique for the treatment of myomas which reduces uterine size and controls symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ravina-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravina 1995</LINK>). It may also be a useful adjunct to surgery in women with massive fibroids (<LINK REF="STD-Ngeh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ngeh 2004</LINK>). Laparoscopic dissection of uterine vessels (LDUV) using ultrasonically activated shears for the treatment of fibroids has been reported to reduce uterine volume and symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Holub-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holub 2003</LINK>). Laparoscopic bipolar coagulation of the uterine blood vessels has recently been described as an alternative to UAE but a high degree of laparoscopic skill is required to isolate the uterine artery without causing damage to the ureters or blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Utero-tonics such as ergometrine, oxytocin, misoprostol and sulprostone cause myometrial contraction and, therefore, potentially reduce blood loss during myomectomy leading to better anatomical reconstruction of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Baldoni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldoni 1995</LINK>). Ergometrine may raise blood pressure while misoprostol may cause fever after its administration.</P>
<P>Myoma dissection techniques include the use of carbon dioxide laser and mesna for chemical dissection (<LINK REF="REF-McLaughin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughin 1985</LINK>). These procedures have the potential to minimize uterine defects from fibroid removal thereby facilitating uterine reconstruction, although they may be time consuming.</P>
<P>The coagulation cascade can be modified with the use of pharmacologic agents such as tranexamic acid, aprotinin, aminocaproic acid, recombinant factor VIIa and gelatin-thrombin haemostatic sealant. These agents interfere with one or more stages of the coagulation cascade, from activation of coagulation to stabilisation of the fibrin clot. The end result is the formation of a stable clot that stops or prevents bleeding.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-07 16:48:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Excessive haemorrhage during myomectomy remains a major challenge to gynaecologic surgeons despite the many procedures that have been described to reduce intraoperative blood loss. The effects of these procedures on blood loss during myomectomy, as reported by previous non-randomised studies, have been inconsistent. Moreover, the types of interventions are so varied that there is a need to identify the most effective procedures with minimal adverse effects to help the gynaecologic surgeon to make a correct choice.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to establish which are the most effective interventions with the fewest adverse effects. The use of preoperative GnRHa was not considered in this review because their effectiveness has been examined in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included trials by addressing the seven specific domains of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org): selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective outcome reporting); and other bias, as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For risk of bias assessment we were not blinded to the names of the trial investigators, their institutions, journals of publication, nor results of the study. For each included trial we described all judgments fully and presented the conclusions in the risk of bias tables. The risk of bias was incorporated into the interpretation of the review findings by means of a sensitivity analysis. We searched for within-trial selective reporting, such as trials failing to report obvious outcomes or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow for inclusion.</P>

<P>We performed statistical analysis using RevMan 5.2. For dichotomous data, we used numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel-Haenzel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) between the groups. If they reported similar outcomes, we recorded the means and their standard deviations for each arm of the trial and expressed study results as mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We would have used standardised mean difference (SMD) if similar outcomes were reported on different scales across studies. If data to calculate the ORs and MDs were not available, we would have used the most detailed numerical data available that might have facilitated similar analyses of included studies (for example P values). We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by the studies with how they were presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

Where similar trials were not available, we discussed the results of the study in a narrative format.

<P>If the studies were sufficiently similar, we carried out a meta-analysis of results from trials using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>We did not consider that blinding was likely to influence findings for the primary review outcome (blood loss and need for blood transfusion). However, for secondary outcomes such as operative difficulties, postoperative morbidity including subjective outcomes such as severe pain, as well as tolerability and safety, blinding status could potentially affect the findings. Twelve studies described the use of a double-dummy placebo that was identical to the intervention and were thus deemed to be at low risk of performance bias.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-29 15:32:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>This review has evaluated the effect of different interventions on blood loss during myomectomy for uterine fibroids. There are a few well designed randomised trials that have assessed the effect of each intervention on blood loss. Compared to placebo or no treatment, misoprostol, vasopressin, bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid, gelatin-thrombin matrix, peri-cervical tourniquet, tourniquet round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament, mesna, ascorbic acid, dinoprostone, loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule and a fibrin sealant patch (collagen sponge with thrombin and fibrinogen) were found to significantly reduce bleeding during myomectomy. In contrast, oxytocin, myoma morcellation and temporary clipping of the uterine artery did not significantly reduce blood loss when compared to placebo or no treatment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Utero-tonics</HEADING>
<P>Some interventions have shown promising effects on reducing blood loss during myomectomy. Both misoprostol (MD -97.88 ml, 95% CI -125.52 to -70.24) and dinoprostone (MD -131.60 ml, 95% CI -253.42 to -9.78), prostaglandin E2 analogues, were shown to significantly reduce blood loss, probably by causing uterine contraction and reducing uterine blood flow. The trials on oxytocin, a known utero-tonic agent, showed no statistically significant effect on blood loss during myomectomy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade</HEADING>
<P>Similarly to prostaglandin E2 analogues, tranexamic acid (MD -243 ml, 95% CI -460.02 to -25.98) was found to significantly reduce blood loss during myomectomy. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that acts by blocking the lysine-binding site on plasmin thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis, the process wherein a fibrin clot, the product of coagulation, is broken down. Tranexamic acid has been used in clinical settings since the 1960s and has been found to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in cardiac surgery, liver transplantation and orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The application of gelatin-thrombin haemostatic sealant (MD -545.00 ml, 95% CI -593.26 to -496.74), a matrix of cross-linked bovine-derived gelatin granules and a bovine-derived thrombin component, on the site of uterine incision significantly reduced blood loss during surgery and the need for blood transfusion. The gelatin matrix is hydrophilic and therefore adheres very well to wet tissue. The matrix activates the coagulation cascade and causes haemostasis.</P>
<P>The application of a fibrin sealant patch (MD -26.50 ml, 95% CI -44.47 to -8.53), which is a surgical patch coated with human coagulation factors fibrinogen and thrombin, significantly reduced blood loss during myomectomy.</P>
<P>Ascorbic acid (MD -411.46 ml, 95% CI -502.58 to -320.34) significantly reduced blood loss during myomectomy. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has important functions in platelets. During the first phase of haemostasis platelets are activated and aggregate to form a haemostasis plug. Ascorbic acid is water-soluble and is not stored in the body, and when depleted the bleeding tendency increases due to dysfunctional connective tissue production in the blood vessel wall.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions on the uterine artery</HEADING>
<P>We found a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss when vasopressin (MD -245.87 ml, 95% CI -434.58 to -57.16) is injected into the uterine muscles overlying the myoma during myomectomy. The injection of bupivacaine plus epinephrine into the myometrium overlying the myoma was evaluated in one study and the result showed evidence of a reduction in blood loss, although this might not be clinically significant (68.6 ml). Both vasopressin and bupivacaine plus epinephrine are known local vasoconstrictors and may reduce local blood flow when injected around the myoma.</P>
<P>A peri-cervical tourniquet and use of a tourniquet round both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligament also significantly reduced blood loss during myomectomy, as anticipated. The uterus receives its blood supply primarily from the uterine artery and the occlusion of the uterine artery is expected to reduce blood loss by reducing blood flow to the uterus.However, there is no evidence that temporary clipping of the uterine artery reduce blood loss.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chemical dissection of myoma</HEADING>
<P>The study on the effect of chemical dissection of the myoma with mesna did not directly evaluate blood loss but showed a significant gain in postoperative haemoglobin levels. Mesna is a lytic agent that can disrupt connections between tissue layers (<LINK REF="REF-Denaro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denaro 2001</LINK>) and may thus facilitate myoma enucleation. Similarly, we found that loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule during laparoscopic myomectomy significantly reduced blood loss.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>One way of evaluating the difficulties encountered during myomectomy was by measuring the operating time. Trials on vasopressin, bupivacaine plus epinephrine, mesna, tranexamic acid, ascorbic acid, myoma enucleation by morcellation, and loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule recorded a significant reduction in operating time. The use of misoprostol, oxytocin, peri-cervical tourniquet, dinoprostone and a fibrin sealant patch showed no evidence of effect on the duration of surgery. The use of a gelatin-thrombin matrix and the temporary clipping of the uterine artery increased the operating time.</P>
<P>Postoperative outcome was assessed by the duration of hospitalisation. A few trials included the duration of hospital stay in their evaluations. The trials on mesna, gelatin-thrombin matrix, ascorbic acid and loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule recorded a significant decrease in the duration of hospital stay. No other trials found a significant effect on the duration of hospitalisation.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-07 19:19:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most comparisons included few trials with small sample sizes and insufficient power to detect moderate differences in blood loss. This review assessed only the effects of interventions versus placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons were not assessed by the review.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data on the adverse effects and costs of the different interventions. The trials on the gelatin-thrombin matrix and ascorbic acid showed no significant difference in adverse effects between the intervention and the control groups. Most trials that commented on the adverse effects simply stated that there were no such effects recorded in the trial. Knowledge of these adverse events and the tolerability of the interventions is important because we have to make a trade off between the estimated benefits and the harms and costs before making any appropriate decisions about use or non-use of any intervention. Nevertheless, evidence from clinical practice has shown that mesna is well tolerated and can be taken orally (<LINK REF="REF-Burkert-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkert 1983</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-29 15:32:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was generally good. The trials had small sample sizes (and, therefore, the effect sizes had large confidence intervals) and there was heterogeneity of effect between the included trials with several of the interventions. Despite the small sample sizes and heterogeneity of effect, there was a significant reduction in blood loss during myomectomy with 10 interventions when compared to placebo or no treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-29 15:32:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Currently, there is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol (MD -97.88 ml, 95% CI -125.52 to -70.24) and vasopressin (MD -245.87 ml, 95% CI -434.58 to -57.16), and low-quality evidence that bupivacaine plus epinephrine (MD -68.60 ml, 95% CI -93.69 to -43.51), gelatin-thrombin matrix (MD -545.00 ml, 95% CI -593.26 to -496.74), tranexamic acid (MD -243 ml, 95% CI -460.02 to -25.98), peri-cervical tourniquet (MD -240.70 ml. 95% CI -359.61 to 121.7),tourniquet round both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligament (MD 1870.00 ml, 95% CI -2547.16, to -1192.84), ascorbic acid (MD -411.46 ml, 95% CI -502.58 to -320.34), dinoprostone (MD -131.60 ml, 95% CI -253.42 to -9.78), loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule (MD -305.01 ml, 95% CI -354.83 to -255) and a fibrin sealant patch (MD -26.50, 95%CI -44.47 to -8.53) may reduce blood loss during myomectomy. However, since we did not include trials with head-to-head comparisons, we cannot draw any conclusions about the superiority of one intervention over the other. Due to the small reduction in blood loss (&lt; 70 ml), the use of bupivacaine plus epinephrine and a fibrin sealant patch have limited clinical importance. At present there is no evidence that oxytocin, myoma enucleation by morcellation, and the temporary clipping of uterine arteries during myomectomy have an effect on intraoperative blood loss.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-07 19:29:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for well designed randomised controlled trials to shed more light on the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing blood loss during myomectomy. To date, a few randomised trials, often will small sample sizes, have addressed this issue and so there is a need to fill the current gap of knowledge which has very important practical implications. Apart from the effectiveness, data on the cost-effectiveness, future pregnancy (if desired), and adverse effects of different interventions are lacking. This is important for clinical decision making since such decisions are based on trade offs between benefits on the one hand and costs and adverse events on the other.</P>

<P>Feedback received from Adam Magos on 29th June 2015:</P>
<P>I believe that the analysis of data regarding the use of tourniquets included in this review is misleading. Two studies are included, of which I was a co-author of one (Taylor et al 2005):<BR/>1. The tourniquet in both studies was not placed only around the cervix as stated in the review. In our study, additional suture tourniquets were placed around the infundibulo-pelvic ligaments to occlude the ovarian arteries. In the study by Ikechebelu, a single Foley catheter was used around the cervix and infundiblo-pelvic ligaments, a technique which is very different and unlikely to achieve total occlusion of the uterine and ovarian vessels as does triple tourniquets (which is why we use sutures).<BR/>2. We did not release the tourniquets during the surgery, whereas Ikechebelu did so every 30 minutes. Of course, when a tourniquet is released, the patient bleeds.<BR/>These are two fundamental differences which I fear were not appreciated by the authors of this review. In my view, as the two techniques are so dissimilar, it is not valid to combine the data and then conclude that "there was no difference in blood loss between the peri-cervical tourniquet and no treatment". I hope you agree and I would be grateful if you would revisit this analysis!<BR/>PS The title of the paper by Ikechebelu was misquoted in the review - they used the word "torniquet" in the title, not "tourniquet".<BR/>

<P>The first author of the review comments as follows: <I>The author (Adam Magos) is right. We were aware of the differences (which we considered minor) between the two studies and that is included in the description of interventions. Given the email from the authors, I agree that we should not aggregate the data from the two studies. </I>
</P>
<P>The review authors have now unpooled these two studies and reported their findings separately throughout the review.</P>
