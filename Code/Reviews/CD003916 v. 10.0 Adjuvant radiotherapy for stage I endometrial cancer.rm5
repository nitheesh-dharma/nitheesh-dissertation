<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women with stage I (early) endometrial cancer have a low risk of recurrence of their disease. Less than 10% of women treated with surgery alone have a recurrence after surgery. This risk is significantly higher (and may be double) for some women with high risk factors including aggressive cell types (grade 3) and deep invasion of the muscle (stage IC). External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after surgery reduces the risk that the cancer will initially recur in the pelvis by around two-thirds compared to surgery alone, but does not reduce the risk of death.</P>
<P>EBRT carries an inherent risk of lasting treatment-related side-effects and routine use should be avoided in stage I endometrial cancer. However, from the available evidence, we cannot exclude the possibility of EBRT benefiting women with high-risk stage I disease. Vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) appears to be useful in reducing locoregional recurrence and may be associated with less side-effects than EBRT.</P>

<P>To assess the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery for stage I endometrial cancer.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-06 11:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Specialised Register to end-2005 for the original review, and extended the search to January 2012 for the update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy (either EBRTor VBT, or both) versus no radiotherapy or VBT in women with stage I endometrial cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-06 11:52:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials and extracted data to a specifically designed data collection form. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes were endometrial cancer-related deaths, locoregional recurrence and distant recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane Review Manager Software 5.1.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:39:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We included eight trials. Seven trials (3628 women) compared EBRT with no EBRT (or VBT), and one trial (645 women) compared VBTwith no additional treatment. We considered six of the eight trials to be of a high quality. Time-to-event data were not available for all trials and all outcomes.</P>
<P>EBRT (with or without VBT) compared with no EBRT (or VBT alone) for stage I endometrial carcinoma significantly reduced locoregional recurrence (time-to-event data: five trials, 2965 women; Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.36, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.52; and dichotomous data: seven trials, 3628 women; Risk Ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.47). This reduced risk of locoregional recurrence did not translate into improved overall survival (time-to-event data: five trials, 2,965 women; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to1.20; and dichotomous data: seven trials, 3628 women; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15) or improved endometrial cancer-related survival (time-to-event data: five trials, 2965 women; HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.28; and dichotomous data: seven trials, 3628 women; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.29) or improved distant recurrence rates (dichotomous data: seven trials, 3628 women; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80 to1.35).</P>
<P>EBRT did not improve survival outcomes in either the intermediate-risk or high-risk subgroups, although high-risk data were limited, and a benefit of EBRT for high-risk women could not be excluded. One trial (PORTEC-2) compared EBRT with VBT in the high-intermediate risk group and reported that VBT was effective in ensuring vaginal control with a non-significant difference in loco-regional relapse rate compared to EBRT (5.1% versus 2.1%; HR 2.08, 95% CI 0.71 to 6.09; P = 0·17). In the subgroup of low-risk patients (IA/B and grade 1/2), EBRT increased the risk of endometrial carcinoma-related deaths (including treatment-related deaths) (two trials, 517 women; RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.66) but there was a lack of data on overall survival. We considered the evidence for the low-risk subgroup to be of a low quality.</P>
<P>EBRT was associated with significantly increased severe acute toxicity (two trials, 1328 patients, RR 4.68, 95% CI 1.35 to 16.16), increased severe late toxicity (six trials, 3501 women; RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.11) and significant reductions in quality of life scores and rectal and bladder function more than 10 years after randomisation (one trial, 351 women) compared with no EBRT.</P>
<P>One trial of VBT versus no additional treatment in women with low-risk lesions reported a non-significant reduction in locoregional recurrence in the VBT group compared with the no additional treatment group (RR 0.39, (95% CI 0.14 to 1.09). There were no significant differences in survival outcomes in this trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:39:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>EBRT reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. It is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. There is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant EBRT for high-risk stage I endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. EBRT may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (IA/B grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. For the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, VBT alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to EBRT. Further research is needed to guide practice for lesions that are truly high risk. In addition, the definitions of risk should be standardised.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-26 09:22:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 2, 2007).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer of the endometrium is one of the commonest gynaecological cancers in the western world. Seventy-five per cent of women affected are postmenopausal. Ninety per cent of tumours are endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Other pathologies include adenosquamous, serous, clear cell carcinoma and mixed mesenchymal. Adenocarcinomas usually present early with postmenopausal bleeding. The commonest modes of spread are invasion of the myometrium and lymphatic spread to the external and common iliac lymph nodes and the para-aortic lymph nodes. Distant metastases generally occur late but occur more frequently with higher grade and more advanced disease (<LINK REF="STD-DiSaia-1985" TYPE="STUDY">DiSaia 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most endometrial cancers are diagnosed at stage I disease. Stage I endometrial cancer is confined to the body of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Creasman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasman 2001</LINK>). The staging system has undergone revision since these quoted studies have been reported. For the purposes of this review, we use the (pre-2010) FIGO staging which defines stage IA as cancer that does not invade the myometrium and is confined to the endometrium; stage IB as cancer that invades less than one half of the muscle wall of the uterus; stage IC is cancer that invades more than one half of the muscle wall of the uterus (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The initial treatment for stage I disease is usually surgery involving a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). The decision to give adjuvant radiotherapy depends on whether the women have high risk factors including the stage of disease, depth of myometrium invasion, grade of the tumour, lymphovascular invasion, the age of the woman and her co-morbidities. The site of first relapse is usually the upper vagina, or vaginal vault, and this can be reduced by adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy.</P>
<P>Adjuvant hormonal therapy was used to treat endometrial cancer in the past but the advantages were offset by disadvantages (Martin-Hirsch 2010). Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy improves survival for women with high-risk cancers and may have added value when used before or after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>). Adjuvant chemoradiation is currently under investigation (<LINK REF="REF-PORTEC_x002d_3" TYPE="REFERENCE">PORTEC-3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to stage the disease accurately, a pelvic and /or para-aortic lymphadenectomy is often performed to determine the need for adjuvant therapy. Two recent randomised trials of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy for stage I endometrial cancer showed no evidence of benefit in terms of overall or disease-free survival in the lymphadenectomy group (<LINK REF="REF-Kitchener-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchener 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panici-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panici 2008</LINK>). Lymphadenectomy is no longer recommended in women with stage I endometrial carcinoma outside of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kitchener-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchener 2009</LINK>), unless it will directly influence management.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both pelvic EBRT and vaginal intracavitary brachytherapy (VBT) carry the risks of acute toxicities and long-term complications (<LINK REF="REF-Creutzberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creutzberg 2001</LINK>). Although the acute side effects of pelvic radiotherapy - on the irradiated skin, gastro-intestinal tract and genitourinary tract - settle down in the majority of patients following treatment, over 20% of patients continue to have persistent mild (grade 1) complications including urgency, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, vaginal dryness and stenosis which may affect their quality of life. Around 3% of women develop severe long-term complications, mostly of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Creutzberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creutzberg 2001</LINK>). Radiotherapy may be associated with a slightly increased risk of second neoplasms (<LINK REF="REF-Berrington-de-Gonzalez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrington de Gonzalez 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our original review combined data from four randomised trials of EBRT (with or without VBT) versus no EBRT (<LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK>) and found no significant difference in overall or endometrial cancer-related survival, despite reduced locoregional recurrence in the EBRT group (<LINK REF="REF-Kong-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2007a</LINK>). Since then, the trend has moved away from EBRT towards the less toxic VBT for local control. The use of vaginal radiotherapy for early endometrial cancer is now more common than EBRT in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Naumann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naumann 2007</LINK>) and several clinicians advocate using VBT alone, even for high-risk endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Atahan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atahan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCloskey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCloskey 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several treatment options for stage I endometrial cancer are in practice, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adjuvant pelvic EBRT,</LI>
<LI>adjuvant VBT,</LI>
<LI>a surveillance policy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Adjuvant pelvic EBRT is designed to irradiate sites of potential micrometastatic cancer that remains in the region of the pelvis after surgery. This includes: the vaginal vault, parametrial ligaments and draining lymph nodes. Vaginal intracavity brachytherapy is designed to treat only the vagina and to decrease radiation effect on the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary tract. A surveillance policy is designed to spare the toxicity of adjuvant treatment, keeping radiotherapy in reserve to salvage any pelvic relapses of the cancer that may occur.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent review, with meta-analyses including new data, concluded that EBRT cannot be routinely recommended as routine treatment to improve survival in early endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>). However, new trials comparing EBRT and VBT and VBT to no additional treatment have since been reported. Hence there is a need for an updated review on the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy to guide the clinical management of stage I endometrial cancer. We considered meta-analyses of trials comparing adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy beyond the scope of this review.</P>

<P>We downloaded all titles and abstracts retrieved by the electronic searches to a database by IS and removed duplicate citations and obvious irrelevant materials. For the original review, three review authors selected studies independently (AK, Chris Williams and Mandy Collingwood, see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>) and then compared notes. For the updated review, AK, NJ and TL selected trials. Differences between authors were resolved by discussion.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review, three review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using pre-specified data collection forms; for the updated review, this was done by AK and TL. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by discussion. For all trials included in the analysis, we collected and analysed data relating to numbers of patients, characteristics of patients and their disease, including histology and grading. We recorded the extent of surgery and details of the dose, fractionation and mode of delivery of the EBRT and brachytherapy. We noted variations between radiation treatments within trials.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias in included studies by using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This included the following assessment.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias:  incomplete outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias: selective reporting of outcomes.</LI>

<P>For time-to-event data (e.g. overall survival, endometrial carcinoma-related death), we attempted to extract hazard ratios (HR) and their associated variances. Where this was not possible, we extracted individual (dichotomous) patient data. Dichotomous data (e.g. incidence of women with locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence or death related to endometrial carcinoma) are presented as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I² was greater than 30% and either T² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> to estimate HRs where possible from Kaplan Meier curves and used the generic inverse facility of <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK> to combine the data. We used the random-effects model with inverse variance weighting for all meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and is presented as the average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of T² and I².

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial protocol stated that we would carry out subgroup analysis by prognostic factors if possible. As the definitions and inclusion of patients with high risk factors varied between the studies, we grouped women according to the investigators' definitions of intermediate-risk and high-risk. Where this was not possible, we defined women as intermediate-risk if they had stage IC or grade 3, and high risk if they had stage IC and grade 3, since these two factors consistently correlate strongly with prognosis.</P>
<P>As standard radiotherapy protocols for stage I endometrial cancer may include VBT, we anticipated heterogeneity and grouped trials by control group for the purposes of investigation and clarification as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>EBRT versus no additional treatment;</LI>
<LI>EBRT versus no additional treatment (with women also receiving VBT balanced across groups); and</LI>

<P>We considered the following five trials to be of high quality and at a low risk of bias: <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2009</LINK>. In these studies, the methods of randomisation were clearly described, analyses were by intention-to-treat and there was minimal loss to follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK> did not describe allocation concealment and lost 24 women to follow-up at a median of 50 months (6%). <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK> lost one woman to follow-up. Due to the nature of the intervention, patients and treatment providers were not blind to group allocation in any of the trials, however, outcome assessor blinding was described in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The published report of <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK> lacked methodological details, specifically with regard to the method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding, however all expected outcomes and attrition were reported. We provisionally considered this trial to be at moderate to low risk of bias pending additional details from the authors.</P>
<P>We considered <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> to be at moderate and high risk of bias respectively. Trial methodology was not adequately described in either, however <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> reported loss to follow-up (none) and baseline characteristics were comparable.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> was only ever published as an abstract. We decided to include it following a personal communication with Dr Soderini confirming that a computer-generated table had been used to randomise patients and that there had been no loss to follow-up. In addition, Dr Soderini provided some additional data and a copy of the poster presentation from the 2003 ESGO conference where the data had originally been presented. According to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), the evidence for the presence of several types of reporting biases, such as publication bias, demonstrates the need to search comprehensively for studies that meet the eligibility criteria for a Cochrane review. Guidelines for including unpublished data such as these are contained in the handbook.</P>
<P>Since <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> did not report time-to-event data, they are not represented in any of the time-to-event meta-analyses in this review. However, where we included their data in our dichotomous meta-analyses, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess their impact. Where meta-analyses combined data from <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> with only one other trial, we presented the meta-analyses with subtotals only. On sensitivity analyses, <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> had little impact on any of the findings, with its weighting limited to 2.8% to 4.3% of all the analyses except for the lymphadenectomy subgroup analysis, where it contributed 21% of the data.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:40:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For our original review (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for original results) several major EBRT studies in endometrial carcinoma were ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK>). Now that these high quality trials have been published, we are able to give more definitive answers regarding adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I endometrial carcinoma.</P>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Eight trials contributed data to this review. Adjuvant EBRT significantly reduced the risk that the first recurrence would be in the field of radiation but had no significant effect on overall survival, endometrial cancer-related survival or distant metastases. There were no survival benefits from ERBT for any of the main subgroup populations, namely, low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk and women who underwent pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, although we downgraded the evidence for the low-risk and the high-risk subgroups to low and moderate quality respectively. The long-term follow-up data from <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK> suggest that these findings hold true over time (<LINK REF="REF-Creutzberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creutzberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nout-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nout 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial compared VBT to no additional treatment in women with low-risk disease (<LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2009</LINK>). This study found that both locoregional and distant recurrences are low in low-risk women and postoperative VBT did not improve survival. However, there was a non-significant reduction in locoregional recurrence in the VBT group. EBRT increased the risk of endometrial carcinoma-related death in the low-risk group, possibly due to the inclusion of data from treatment-related deaths, however, this could be due to chance. We have downgraded the quality of this evidence due to the limited data, inclusion in the meta-analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> (an older study with some methodological short-comings), and inclusion of low-intermediate risk data from <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK>. Since the loco-regional recurrence rate in this subgroup is low and not significantly improved by VBT, VBT is probably not required in these women. We do not believe that further EBRT research is warranted in this low-risk group.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about VBT in intermediate and high-risk women: One trial compared EBRT with VBT in intermediate-risk women (<LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK>) and VBT was given to all women (<LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK>) or some women (<LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>) in two trials, such that VBT was balanced between intervention and control groups. VBT was effective in ensuring vaginal control in <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK> although the locoregional relapse was slightly higher (statistically not significant) with VBT than with EBRT. <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK> reported a significant difference in locoregional relapse in favour of the EBRT plus VBT group; however, women in this group experienced significantly more severe late side-effects. <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK> recommend that VBT is used as the adjuvant treatment of choice for women with endometrial carcinoma of intermediate-risk (<LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK>) and high-intermediate risk (<LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK>), respectively. Due to a lack of data, it is not yet known whether the use of VBT will have a survival benefit over no treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk stage I women, although it is unlikely to yield a survival benefit since there is no survival benefit with EBRT. In addition, whilst VBT appears useful to reduce the risk of vaginal recurrence, it is not known whether it reduces pelvic side wall recurrence. Further evidence, comparing VBT with no additional treatment in intermediate-risk and high-risk women is desirable, however, since 5-year loco-regional recurrence rates were 14% in the "no treatment" group of <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK>, such trials may be unethical.</P>
<P>Regarding toxicity, EBRT was associated with significantly more severe acute toxicity and late toxicity (grade 3 and 4) that no ERBT. A few women were reported to have died from radiotherapy-related complications.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-01-26 09:32:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review confirms the main findings of the previous review as well as the conclusions from major randomised studies in women with stage I endometrial carcinoma, i.e. adjuvant EBRT reduces locoregional recurrence but does not improve overall survival or endometrial cancer-related deaths; however, we found insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the high-risk subgroup and cannot exclude a benefit for EBRT in this subgroup. In addition, based on low-quality evidence, our findings suggest that EBRT may have an adverse effect on cancer-specific survival in low-risk women. Therefore, whilst we agree with the current practice and recommendation from <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK> that routine EBRT should not be recommended in women with stage I endometrial carcinoma regardless of risk factors, further evidence is needed to guide practice for women who are truly high-risk. To our knowledge, no studies have assessed the benefits and risks of adjuvant VBT versus no additional treatment in women with intermediate-risk or high-risk stage I endometrial cancer. We are, therefore, unable to draw conclusions about whether VBT is necessary in these women.</P>

<P>This updated review has included several high-quality randomised studies, including <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2009</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 2011</LINK> lacked some methodological details but since all expected outcomes were reported and groups had similar baseline characteristics, we considered this trial at moderate to low risk of bias, pending more details. We acknowledged that <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> are of poorer quality and may have higher risk of bias but we have carried out sensitivity analysis by excluding these trials to assess their impact. We downgraded the evidence relating to the high-risk group of women as these meta-analyses consisted of data from two or three trials, one of which was <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK>. Furthermore, we included high-intermediate data from <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK> and not true high-risk data (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).This means that, for high-risk women, further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:49:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although our initial protocol stated that we would carry out subgroup analysis by prognostic factors if possible, we did not predefine these subgroups. The prognostic factors considered differed between included trials as did the definitions, and inclusion of women, for the various risk subgroups. We grouped women according to investigators definitions or, if this was not possible, we defined women as intermediate-risk if they had stage IC or grade 3, and high-risk if they had stage IC and grade 3. In <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK> we could not separate the low-intermediate risk from low-risk and thus this group was included in both groups; their high-intermediate risk data were included in our high-risk subgroup. This may be considered inappropriate and we therefore, presented results with and without these data. However, the difference in definitions and lack of individual patient data to separate women into the different risk-defined subgroups may have introduced bias. In the next update, we plan to analyse data from women in the <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK> trials who satisfy the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK> criteria for high-risk data, pending the availability of these data from the investigators. This may reduce the potential for bias in this subgroup. We urge investigators planning and conducting trials in early endometrial cancer to standardise the definitions of risk.</P>
<P>Since writing the protocol for this review, VBT has become the standard adjuvant intervention for early endometrial cancer at many centres; therefore, for the updated review we decided to group trials according to control group (e.g. no additional treatment or VBT), for the purposes of clarity, and to investigate potential heterogeneity between trial interventions. There was no significant heterogeneity between these subgroups, however, they consisted of one to three trials only and any differences or similarities between them might have resulted from bias.</P>
<P>It may be argued that <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK> should not be included in meta-analyses of EBRT versus no EBRT as this trial directly compares EBRT with VBT, therefore VBT is not balanced between groups. We considered VBT to be equivalent to the 'no treatment' or 'control' group and, for the purposes of clarity, we distinguished this trial in a separate subgroup. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses showed that the results were statistically similar when <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-2</LINK> data were excluded, even for loco-regional recurrence; furthermore, we detected no statistical heterogeneity when these data were included.</P>
<P>For the risk subgroups, <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> reported endometrial cancer-related deaths only and not overall survival. However, since the overall data for the two survival outcomes were similar in this trial, we included these cancer-specific data in the overall survival subgroup meta-analyses. Whilst this may not be entirely appropriate, sensitivity analyses revealed that it had little impact on the dichotomous findings. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> did not report time-to-event data and therefore was not included in the main (time-to-event) survival meta-analyses.</P>

<P>The results of this review agree with the <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK> review, although <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK> excluded <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK>, on the basis that it was undertaken before the introduction of FIGO staging, and <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK>, on the basis that it was only published as an abstract. Neither <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK> presented time-to-event data. However, we included these lower quality trials and performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of including their data on the review findings. With regard to the outcome 'endometrial carcinoma-related deaths' (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), their combined weight accounted for 21.7% and their inclusion had little impact on the overall risk ratio (seven trials, 3628 women; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.29; versus five trials, 2965 women; RR 0.97, 95%CI 0.71 to 1.33). <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK> contributed a 2.8% weighting to the 'death from all causes' outcome and, similarly, had a negligible impact on the results (RR 0.98 versus RR 1.00).</P>
<P>The original Cochrane review found a trend towards a survival benefit in high-risk women (1C G3), however, the ASTEC/EN5 data now dominate these meta-analyses of the high-risk subgroup (weighting of 45% to 65%). These new data have shifted the survival HRs in the direction of no difference.</P>
<P>Since adjuvant EBRT does not improve survival from stage I endometrial cancer, even, it appears, in the high-risk group, it raises questions as to whether other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy (CT) and targeted therapies may be more effective than radiotherapy in improving survival. Our review was not predefined to answer the question of adjuvant chemotherapy in endometrial carcinoma; this intervention has been reviewed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK> review, data from four trials comparing conventional adjuvant platinum based combination chemotherapy to radiotherapy were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maggi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Susumu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Susumu 2008</LINK>); meta-analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in survival rates (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92) and progression-free survival (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97) in favour of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-PORTEC_x002d_3" TYPE="REFERENCE">PORTEC-3</LINK>, a randomised phase III trial comparing concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant CT with pelvic radiation alone in high-risk and advanced stage endometrial carcinoma, is currently ongoing.</P>
<P>Several targeted therapies are now emerging for endometrial cancer, including mTOR inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor, which are beyond the scope of this review.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated systematic review confirms that although EBRT decreases locoregional recurrence, it does not decrease overall deaths or deaths related to endometrial cancer in stage I endometrial cancer, regardless of their risk factors. Although a benefit for high-risk stage I disease cannot be excluded, we agree with the recommendations of <LINK REF="STD-ASTEC_x002f_EN.5" TYPE="STUDY">ASTEC/EN.5</LINK> investigators, namely that routine EBRT cannot be recommended to improve survival in women with stage I endometrial carcinoma, and that VBT may be preferable for local control in intermediate and high-intermediate risk women. In women with low-risk disease, adjuvant radiotherapy may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer-related survival compared to no additional treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-01 09:40:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the relatively good prognosis of women with stage 1 endometrial cancer, large numbers of participants are needed to conduct sufficiently powered RCTs to detect any differences in survival that may be present. The number of women with high-risk stage I endometrial cancer who have participated in trials of adjuvant EBRT is relatively small. The apparent lack of any survival advantage in this group does not exclude the possibility of a small advantage. Our sample size means that our analyses lack power and there may be a place for more trials of EBRT in this selected group. In addition, since adjuvant radiotherapy may not be shown to increase survival in women with stage I endometrial cancer including the high-risk group, there is a need to investigate other treatment modalities which may improve outcome for the high-risk women. This includes chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The role of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is currently being investigated in endometrial cancer patients with high risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-PORTEC_x002d_3" TYPE="REFERENCE">PORTEC-3</LINK>). </P>

<P>Central pathology review of 367 (86%) women had been completed at the time of analysis (183 [86%] women in EBRT group and 184 [86%] in VBT group).  After review, 34 (8%) women had features of high-risk disease (19 [9%] in EBRT group versus 15 [7%] in VBT group); 27 (6%) were low risk, and therefore in retrospect ineligible (12 [6%] versus 15 [7%]). Analysis of outcomes of the 366 women (86%) who remained high-intermediate risk (true high-intermediate risk) at review confirmed the findings of the ITT analysis.</P>

However, Dr Soderini confirmed via personal communication that analysis was by ITT, there was no loss to follow-up and that women were randomised via a computer-generated table after complete surgical staging. Median follow-up was 48 months (range 12-84 months). EC-related deaths were 4/63 (RT) versus 5/60 (no RT). Attempts to publish the data apparently halted when Dr Soderini changed jobs in 2005. In addition to providing us with limited unpublished data, he sent us a copy of the original poster presentation (ESGO meeting in Brussels, 2003).

<P>For the updated review, two reviewe authors (AK and TL) independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator),</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or,</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.<BR/>We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by 1 to 5 above)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias and assessed each study as at:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see '<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Results</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of four trials included 1770 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-99" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 99</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PORTEC_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PORTEC-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soderini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soderini 2003</LINK>). The addition of pelvic external beam radiotherapy to surgery reduced locoregional recurrence, a relative risk (RR) of 0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.44, P &lt; 0.00001), which is a 72% reduction in the risk of pelvic relapse (95% CI 56% to 83%) and an absolute risk reduction of 6% (95% CI of 4% to 8%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one locoregional recurrence is 16.7 patients (95% CI 12.5 to 25). The reduction in the risk of locoregional recurrence did not translate into either a reduction in the risk of distant recurrence or death from all causes or endometrial cancer death. A subgroup analysis of women with multiple high risk factors (including stage 1c and grade 3) showed a trend toward the reduction in the risk of death from all causes and endometrial cancer death in patients who underwent adjuvant external beam radiotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Authors' conclusions  </HEADING>
<P>Patients with stage I endometrial carcinoma have different risks of local and distant recurrence depending on the presence of risk factors including stage 1c, grade 3, lymphovascular space invasion and age. Though external beam pelvic radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence by 72%, there is no evidence to suggest that it reduced the risk of death. In patients with multiple high risk factors, including stage 1c and grade 3, there was a trend towards a survival benefit and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy may be justified. For patients with only one risk factor, grade 3 or stage 1c, no definite conclusion can be made and data from ongoing studies (ASTEC; Lukka) are awaited. External beam radiotherapy carries a risk of toxicity and should be avoided in stage 1 endometrial cancer patients with no high risk factors.</P>
