<P>
<B>Significance of the review</B>
</P>
<P>Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are quite common and can cause severe neck pain, impairment and decreased quality of life. Degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine can result in severe pain, instability and radiculopathy (pain spreading down the arms and into the head), myelopathy (spasticity and weakness of arms or hands, which may include "numb and clumsy" hands) or both. Chinese oral and topical herbal medicines are being used to treat many neck disorders. Some have been tested in clinical trials. </P>
<P>
<B>Description of the trials</B>
</P>
<P>Two Chinese oral herbal medications were tested in three randomized controlled trials that included 701 adults with chronic neck pain with radicular signs or symptoms or myelopathy. One oral herbal medication was compared with Mobicox (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication) and Methycobal (drug to reduce numbness, tingling in the arms), and the other (Compound Qishe Tablet) with placebo and Jingfukang. A topical herbal medicine (Compound Extractum Nucis Vomicae) was compared with Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication).</P>
<P>
<B>Findings</B>
</P>
<P>Oral herbal medications may reduce neck pain more than placebo and Jingfukang. A topical herbal medicine (Compound Extractum Nucis Vomicae) also relieved neck pain in the short term (four weeks), but the trail had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations</B>
</P>
<P>All four included studies were in Chinese and two of these studies were unpublished. Half of the trials had a low risk of bias, but they only tested the effects of short term use (up to eight weeks). The size of the studies was small. There is a need for trials with adequate numbers of participants that address the long-term efficacy or effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine compared to placebo. </P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>For chronic neck pain with or without radicular symptoms, there is low quality evidence that Compound Qishe Tablet is more effective than placebo for pain relief, measured at the end of the treatment. However, the size of the studies was small and the effect was measured in the short-term. Further research is very likely to change both the effect size and our confidence in the results. There is a need for trials with adequate numbers of participants that address long-term efficacy or effectiveness of herbal medicine compared to placebo.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 16:35:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>We electronically searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED (beginning to October 1, 2009), the Chinese Biomedical Database and related herbal medicine databases in Japan and South Korea (1979 to 2007). We also contacted content experts and handsearched a number of journals published in China. 
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:20:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials with adults with a clinical diagnosis of cervical degenerative disc disease, cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy supported by appropriate radiological findings. The interventions were Chinese herbal medicines, defined as products derived from raw or refined plants or parts of plants, minerals and animals that are used for medicinal purposes in any form. The primary outcome was pain relief, measured with a visual analogue scale, numeric scale or other validated tool.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-09-16 15:07:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>The data were independently extracted and recorded by two review authors on a pre-developed form. Risk of bias and clinical relevance were assessed separately by two review authors using the twelve criteria and the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:21:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>All four included studies were in Chinese; two of which were unpublished. Effect sizes were not clinically relevant and there was low quality evidence for all outcomes due to study limitations and sparse data (single studies). Two trials (680 participants) found that Compound Qishe Tablets relieved pain better in the short-term than either placebo or Jingfukang; one trial (60 participants) found than an oral herbal formula of Huangqi ((<I>Radix Astragali</I>)18 g, Dangshen (<I>Radix Codonopsi</I>s) 9 g, Sanqi (<I>Radix Notoginseng</I>) 9 g, Chuanxiong (<I>Rhizoma Chuanxiong</I>)12 g, Lujiao (<I>Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum</I>) 12 g, and Zhimu (<I>Rhizoma Anemarrhenae</I>)12 g) relieved pain better than Mobicox or Methycobal and one trial (360 participants) showed that a topical herbal medicine, Compound Extractum Nucis Vomicae, relieved pain better than Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-03 18:15:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine can result in severe pain, instability, radiculopathy or myelopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1998</LINK>), impairment and decreased quality of life. Cervical degenerative disc disease includes spondyloarthrosis, apophyseal joint osteoarthritis and disc degeneration. Degenerative changes increase from 5% to 10% in people between the ages of 20 and 30 years, to more than 50% by 45 years of age. Approximately 90% of men over the age of 50 and 90% of women over the age of 60 have radiographic evidence of cervical spondylosis (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>). Population-based data from Rochester, Minnesota, USA, indicate that cervical radiculopathy has an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, with a peak at 50 to 54 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Radhakrisnan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrisnan 1994</LINK>). Data on the natural history of cervical radiculopathy are limited. In the same study from Rochester, USA, 26% of 561 patients with cervical radiculopathy underwent surgery within three months of the diagnosis (typically for the combination of radicular pain, sensory loss and muscle weakness), while the remainder were treated conservatively. Recurrence, defined as the re-appearance of symptoms of radiculopathy after a symptom-free interval of at least six months, was common and occurred in 32% of patients during a median follow-up of 4.9 years (<LINK REF="REF-Heckmann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckmann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrisnan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrisnan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saal-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saal 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sampath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampath 1999</LINK>). There are many conditions that can cause chronic neck pain. Degeneration of the cervical spine is the most common one. So, this review focuses on the chronic neck pain due to degenerative disc disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-03 18:18:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Conventional medical treatments for cervical degenerative disc disease are limited by their modest effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2002</LINK>). Conservative treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs), narcotics, muscle relaxants, physical therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). The main objectives of conservative treatments are to relieve pain, improve function and improve health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2002</LINK>). Surgical treatment for cervical disc disease is indicated when symptoms are refractory to conservative treatments and neurological symptoms are progressive (<LINK REF="REF-Agrillo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agrillo 1999</LINK>). The goals of surgical treatment should be decompression, restoration of alignment and stability. However, many patients who undergo surgical treatment for cervical disc disease may continue to suffer from neck pain. In addition, many patients may not be good candidates for surgery because of their co-morbidities, advancing age or preference for conservative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Carette-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carette 2005</LINK>). As a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), herbal medicines have the potential to avoid the adverse effects of medications and surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Bensoussan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensoussan 1996</LINK>). Natural substances, including herbal medicines, have being used to promote healing and alleviate neck pain in western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Audette-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audette 2008</LINK>). In China, many patients with cervical disc disease are increasingly turning to CAM, including herbal medicines, to alleviate their symptoms and reduce the side effects of medications. However, Chinese herbal medicines are not totally without side effects and some patients who take them might experience nausea, vomiting or dizziness. </P>
<P>Herbal medicines have been used for centuries in China. While in the strictest sense of the term, herbal medicine only includes plant materials (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2006</LINK>), the study of herbal medicine under a Chinese Herbal Medicine framework always includes the study of herbs, animal or insect products or minerals, since they are often combined in one formula. Herbal medicines are defined in this review as products derived from raw or refined plants or parts of plants (e.g. leaves, stems, buds, flowers, roots or tubers), minerals (e.g. borneol) and animals (e.g. prepared centipede or earthworm) and used for the treatment of disease. Synonyms for herbal medicines include: herbal remedies, herbal medications, herbal products, herbal preparations, herbal formulas, medicinal herbs and phytopharmaceuticals. There are four kinds of herbal therapies: i) single herb, ii) Chinese proprietary medicines, iii) mixtures of different herbs and iv) any one of the aforementioned three therapies plus Western pharmaceuticals, also known as <I>integrative medicinal treatment </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1999</LINK>). Chinese proprietary medicines are usually based on well-established and long-standing recipes and formulated as tablets or capsules for commerce, convenience or palatability. The mixture of herbs prescribed by Chinese herbalists depends on the differentiation of symptoms according to the signs and symptoms and other disease information derived from the four examinations (observation, listening and smelling, inquiring, feeling the pulse and palpation) and analysed to detect the cause and location of the disease and the relationship between pathogenic factors and the vital energy. The disease is then diagnosed as a syndrome using an approach that is different from conventional Western medicine. Chinese herbal medicine is often combined with Western pharmaceuticals to produce an <I>integrative medicinal treatment </I>that may be more effective than either treatment alone (e.g. an injection of Chuanxiong (<I>Rhizoma Chuanxiong</I>), or rhubarb (<I>Radix et Rhizoma Rhei</I>), an injection of a mixture of Chuanxiong and Danshen (<I>Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae</I>) or other herbal preparations plus Western medicine).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-03 18:22:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>In the basic theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), chronic neck pain with radicular signs or symptoms or myelopathy in cervical degenerative disc diseases is believed to be caused by the obstruction of Qi flowing and blood circulating in the neck area due to pathogenic wind, cold, and dampness invading the neck, inducing various symptoms of the neck, such as pain, numbness, cold feeling, etc. TCM doctors prescribe herbal formulae based on findings from the four examinations to deal with the pathogenic factors. Some active substances in herbal medicine can promote Qi flowing and blood circulating to relieve pain.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-03 17:47:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Given the heavy public health and economic burden that neck pain due to cervical degenerative disc disease causes and the fact that many sufferers consult CAM practitioners for their symptoms, a systematic review of these practices was justified.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the English databases; one author (XC) conducted the literature searches in the Chinese databases and stored the search results (duplicates removed) in a reference bibliographic management system. Two review authors (XC, KT) independently screened the titles and abstracts to select potential references. Those that appeared to be relevant, or whose relevance could not be determined from the information available, were retrieved for further screening. The two review authors then independently read the selected papers and made a final selection decision. They made independent decisions at each step and discussed their decisions to reach consensus.They would have consulted a third author (YW) if disagreements persisted. However, there were no disagreements. The names of journals and authors were not masked in the identification phase as XC and KT were not familiar with articles in this area. The names of journals and authors were not masked in the data extraction phase, as the review authors were already familiar with these articles from the identification phase.</P>
<P>Colleagues agreed to search the Japanese database (OH) and the South Korean database (KDY).

This form was translated to Chinese and the information initially recorded in Chinese. After the data extraction process was completed, the extracted information was translated to English. We used consensus to make decisions. We would have consulted a third author (YW) if disagreements persisted. However, there were no disagreements. If the number randomized and the number analysed were inconsistent, we calculated and recorded the percentage lost-to-follow-up. We planned to extract data to allow an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (the analysis should include all the participants in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned). However, ITT analyses were not performed in any of the studies we found. For binary outcomes, we planned to record the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, we planned to extract the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each group. If the data were reported using geometric means, we planned to extract the standard deviations on the log scale. Medians and ranges were extracted and reported if available. If necessary, we contacted the authors for additional information.</P>
<P>We collected these data:</P>
<P>(1) <I>
<B>Characteristics of trials: </B>
</I>date, location, period of data collection, year of publication, publication status, case definitions, sponsor of trial (commercial, academic, pharmaceutical, or unknown), definitions of cure and efficacy if available.</P>
<P>(2) <I>
<B>Characteristics of participants</B>
</I>: number of participants in each group, age (as described in the article: mean, median or range), numbers of participants with the main symptom if available. </P>
<P>(3) <I>
<B>Characteristics of interventions: </B>
</I>type, dose and duration of therapy. </P>
<P>(4) <I>
<B>Characteristics of outcome measures</B>
</I>: overall symptoms, adverse events resulting from the treatment (e.g. mortality, life threatening, toxic response, or anaphylaxis). </P>
<P>Two review authors (XC, KT) independently assessed the risk of bias of each relevant article, using the twelve criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). See <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> for the definitions of the criteria. Criteria were scored yes (criteria met), no (criteria not met), or unsure (not enough information to make the decision). Articles that met six of the twelve criteria were considered to have a low risk of bias. We used consensus to make decisions and consulted a third author (YW) if disagreements persisted.</P>
<P>Clinical relevance was assessed using the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>) and are outlined in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>As with other decisions, the clinical relevance of the studies was independently assessed by two review authors who used consensus to make final decisions and consulted with a third author if disagreements persisted.</P>

<P>Descriptive statistics were used to provide a summary description of the groups, interventions, outcomes, adverse effect of treatments and cost of care if available. All results reported were based on a small sample size. </P>
<P>As the number of clinical trials included in the review is small, we did not test for potential publication bias with a funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were insufficient data available to use quantitative analyses to summarize the data. However, we assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using an adapted GRADE approach, as recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). The quality of the evidence for a specific outcome was based on the study design, risk of bias, consistency of results, directness (generalizability), precision (sufficient data) and potential bias for the reporting of results across all studies that measured that particular outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Qualitative Analysis of Trial Results</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>High quality:</I> Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, based upon consistent findings from at least two RCTs with low risk of bias and generalizable to the population in question. There are sufficient data with narrow confidence intervals. There are no known or suspected reporting biases.</P>
<P>
<I>Moderate quality:</I> Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; one of the domains is not met.</P>
<P>
<I>Low quality:</I> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; two of the domains are not met</P>
<P>
<I>Very low quality:</I> Great uncertainty about the estimate; three of the domains are not met.</P>
<P>
<I>No evidence: </I>No evidence from RCTs.</P>

<P>The twelve criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK> were used to assess the risk of bias. The number of criteria met varied from 3/12 to 6/12 with a mean score of 4.5/12.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 18:58:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>This review was only able to report on short-term effects of Chinese herbal formulae since pain relief was measured either immediately after the end of the treatment or four to eight weeks later. However, all the studies reported that the herbal medicine tested were better than the comparison treatment. There was only one study comparing herbal medicine to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>); the others compared it to other medications or combinations of other medications. We planned to assess the evidence of Chinese Herbal formulae on function, patient satisfaction or neurological outcomes but this information was not available from the four studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:02:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>All four included studies were in Chinese and two of these studies were unpublished. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to western countries. One of the challenges faced in the review was searching for articles. Our first round of searching the electronic databases did not identify any studies. A subsequent update yielded only one study through the conventional database after reviewing the titles and abstracts of over 900 articles. Only one study was found through the Chinese Biomedical database after spending a considerable amount of effort. After consulting with many experts who conducted clinical trials in this area (by YW), only two further papers were obtained. Our experience in this review indicates that better organization of published articles (such as including Chinese journals in electronic format, using Roman characters for Chinese words) is required for the field of complementary medicine in non-English databases. Many hours were spent searching by hand with no yield. It also indicated to us that this is a wide open area of potential research as many articles were found, but only a few RCTs. We complimented our search in the Chinese databases as many journals were not in electronic format. Items for clinical relevance were poorly reported by these studies, which raises serious doubts about the applicability of their results to clinical practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:03:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>On reviewing the four articles, we found that in general, the write-up was poor. The authors did not follow the CONSORT statement in reporting the results of their clinical trials. Although the CONSORT statement has been translated, it is not well known in the Chinese research community and better promotion is required to enhance the quality and the write-up of the research.</P>
<P>The most difficult challenge faced in this review was clinical heterogeneity. The heterogeneity appeared at many levels, such as in the sample group, the type of herbal medicine used and the outcomes measured. It was not possible to pool the results of these studies. Another challenge was the lack of data for calculating an effect size for even a single study.</P>
<P>Weaknesses of this review rest with limitations in the primary studies. We were unable to make any firm statements about the quality of the evidence, since the therapies were only reported in a single trial. We were not able to identify in any of the two studies in which there were drop-outs reported whether intention-to-treat analysis was used. In reviewing many of the articles in this field in Chinese, this concept does not appear to be familiar to the researchers in this area. Furthermore, details of drop-outs were not reported in any of the studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-09-16 14:36:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Our approach to summarizing the literature has several strengths. We used a comprehensive, librarian-assisted search of multiple databases. We used a team of international healthcare professionals to decide on article relevance and assess risk of bias. We avoided any professional bias inherent in having a single profession evaluate its literature.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-01 17:48:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:04:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>For chronic neck pain, with or without radicular symptoms, there is low quality evidence that Chinese herbal medicine is more effective than placebo for pain relief, measured at the end of the treatment. However, there was only one study (240 participants) and the effect was only measured in the short term. The effect size was small and it was not clinically relevant. Therefore, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change it.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:04:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>There is a need for trials with adequate sample size that address the long-term efficacy or effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine compared to placebo.</P>

<OL>
<LI>
<I>Was the method of randomisation adequate? </I>A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer-generated random numbers table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the treatment allocation concealed?</I> Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the patient blinded to the intervention? </I>The review author determines if the treatments were considered equally credible and acceptable to patients in order to score a "yes."</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the care provider blinded to the intervention?</I> The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention?</I> The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable?</I> The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis?</I> All randomized patients are reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomisation for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</I>
<B> </B>This item was scored "yes" if all the results from all pre-specified outcomes were adequately reported. </LI>
<LI>
<I>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? </I>In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).</LI>
<LI>
<I>Were co-interventions avoided or similar?</I> Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or be similar between the index and control groups.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the compliance acceptable in all groups?</I> The review author determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).</LI>
<LI>
<I>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar?</I> Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</LI>
