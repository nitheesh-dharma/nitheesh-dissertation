<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-07-26 14:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of evidence-based psychological interventions designed to prevent the onset of a depressive disorder and to reduce any existing symptoms of depression.</P>
<P>
<B>Who may be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>People involved in public health initiatives, school personnel and mental health clinicians.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Depressive disorder is common. It is associated with a negative impact on the functioning of young people and is expensive to society at large. Finding a way to prevent the onset of depressive disorder has the potential to make an important impact on the burden of depression in young people.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>Whether psychological depression prevention programmes designed to prevent the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents are effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Which trials were included in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We included 83 studies (in particular randomised controlled trials) of evidence-based psychotherapy interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third wave CBT, interpersonal therapy) that had the specific aim of preventing the onset of depressive disorder. For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium-term follow-up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self-rated) there were 73 trials with 13,829 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>We found that, compared with any comparison group, psychological depression prevention programmes have small positive benefits on depression prevention. There were some problems with the way the trials were done and in particular the results showed that compared to an attention placebo comparison group (a control intervention that controls for non-specific factors like involvement in a trial and attention from researchers), these programmes had no effect. There is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. However, based on the effects seen for targeted depression prevention programmes (albeit with inadequate control groups), we recommend that further research be undertaken to test the effectiveness of depression prevention programmes in populations of young people who already have some symptoms of depression. Such trials should compare the intervention to an attention placebo comparison group and measure whether depressive diagnosis is prevented in the long term. They also need to consider whether the approach is something that can be implemented in the real world. In addition, they should consider and measure whether the intervention produces harmful outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-19 10:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Depression is common in young people. It has a marked negative impact and is associated with self-harm and suicide. Preventing its onset would be an important advance in public health. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was last updated in 2011.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-07-19 10:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To determine whether evidence-based psychological interventions (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and third wave CBT)) are effective in preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-01 13:22:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR to 11 September 2015), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We searched conference abstracts and reference lists of included trials and reviews, and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-07-19 10:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of an evidence-based psychological prevention programme compared with any comparison control for young people aged 5 to 19 years, who did not currently meet diagnostic criteria for depression.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-19 10:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and rated their risk of bias. We adjusted sample sizes to take account of cluster designs and multiple comparisons. We contacted trial authors for additional information where needed. We assessed the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-26 14:20:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 83 trials in this review. The majority of trials (67) were carried out in school settings with eight in colleges or universities, four in clinical settings, three in the community and four in mixed settings. Twenty-nine trials were carried out in unselected populations and 53 in targeted populations.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium-term follow-up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and the risk of having a diagnosis of depression was reduced for participants receiving an intervention compared to those receiving no intervention (risk difference (RD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.05 to -0.01; P value = 0.01). We rated this evidence as moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria. There were 70 trials (73 trial arms) with 13,829 participants that contributed to the analysis for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self-rated) at the post-intervention time point, with results showing a small but statistically significant effect (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.15; P value &lt; 0.0001). This effect persisted to the short-term assessment point (up to three months) (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.17; P value &lt; 0.0001; 16 studies; 1558 participants) and medium-term (4 to 12 months) assessment point (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.05; P value = 0.0002; 53 studies; 11,913 participants); however, the effect was no longer evident at the long-term follow-up<I>.</I> We rated this evidence as low to moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria.</P>
<P>The evidence from this review is unclear with regard to whether the type of population modified the overall effects; there was statistically significant moderation of the overall effect for depression symptoms (P value = 0.0002), but not for depressive disorder (P value = 0.08). For trials implemented in universal populations there was no effect for depression diagnosis (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01) and a small effect for depression symptoms (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.05). For trials implemented in targeted populations there was a statistically significantly beneficial effect of intervention (depression diagnosis RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; depression symptoms SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.23). Of note were the lack of attention placebo-controlled trials in targeted populations (none for depression diagnosis and four for depression symptoms). Among trials implemented in universal populations a number used an attention placebo comparison in which the intervention consistently showed no effect.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-26 14:21:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the results show small positive benefits of depression prevention, for both the primary outcomes of self-rated depressive symptoms post-intervention and depression diagnosis up to 12 months (but not beyond). Estimates of numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB = 11) compare well with other public health interventions. However, the evidence was of moderate to low quality using the GRADE framework and the results were heterogeneous. Prevention programmes delivered to universal populations showed a sobering lack of effect when compared with an attention placebo control. Interventions delivered to targeted populations, particularly those selected on the basis of depression symptoms, had larger effect sizes, but these seldom used an attention placebo comparison and there are practical difficulties inherent in the implementation of targeted programmes. We conclude that there is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes.</P>
<P>Future research should focus on current gaps in our knowledge. Given the relative lack of evidence for universal interventions compared with attention placebo controls and the poor results from well-conducted effectiveness trials of universal interventions, in our opinion any future such trials should test a depression prevention programme in an indicated targeted population using a credible attention placebo comparison group. Depressive disorder as the primary outcome should be measured over the longer term, as well as clinician-rated depression. Such a trial should consider scalability as well as the potential for the intervention to do harm.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:01:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Depression is a common problem in young people. Overall prevalence rates from a large meta-analysis, measured from point prevalence up to 12-month period prevalence, were estimated at 2.8% for children under the age of 13 and 5.6% for young people aged 13 to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Costello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2006</LINK>). Rates rise steeply in adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2001</LINK>), with the peak period for the emergence of new cases of depression being during adolescence and young adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK>). By the age of 19, between a fifth and a quarter of young people have suffered from a depressive disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1998</LINK>). Depression in young people is associated with poor academic performance and vocational attainment and achievement, difficulties with interpersonal relationships, substance abuse, and attempted and completed suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brent-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brent-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rhode-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhode 1994</LINK>). The Global Burden of Disease study, first published in 1997, ranked depressive disorder fourth in its estimate of disease burden, ahead of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). By 2002, depressive disorders ranked second in developed countries and first in developing countries with low mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2004</LINK>). Young people account for the greatest global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2011</LINK>). This means that reducing the incidence of depression has become a major focus, with a large number of trials of preventative interventions being published in the last three decades.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Prevention can be universal, where the intervention is implemented for a designated population regardless of risk, or targeted to a population at high risk for the disorder. Targeted interventions can be further classified into selective interventions that focus on populations with a risk factor for the disorder (e.g. family history) and indicated interventions that focus on populations with symptoms or signs suggestive of incipient disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Mrazek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mrazek 1994</LINK>). Early intervention may be considered prevention or treatment. The Institute of Medicine Report (<LINK REF="REF-Mrazek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mrazek 1994</LINK>), and the updated report (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2009</LINK>), recommend that prevention is defined as those interventions that occur prior to the onset of a clinically diagnosed disorder.</P>
<P>There are many psychological treatments for depression, which include psychodynamic, humanistic, integrative, systemic, behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) (including 'third wave' cognitive behavioural therapies). In a previous version of this review we had included both psychological interventions (broadly) and psychoeducational interventions; however, this review highlighted the fact that the vast majority of depression interventions developed thus far have been based on CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) (<LINK REF="REF-Callahan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>). The most robust evidence for the treatment of depression is for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) (which is an integrative therapy) (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2011</LINK>). They therefore represent a 'good best bet' in terms of depression prevention.</P>
<P>Depression prevention interventions are often delivered to a group within a school setting. This is because young people spend a significant amount of time at school so disseminating a programme within a school or classroom, and to groups of young people is likely to be cost-effective. Delivery to a group may also reinforce efficacy by providing positive peer experiences. Both group and individual interventions usually take place on a weekly basis with 8 to 12 sessions delivered (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The aetiology of depressive disorder is complex and includes biological, psychological and social factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cicchetti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicchetti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCauley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCauley 2001</LINK>). There are clear theories regarding the individual factors that create a predisposition to developing depression, which may alternatively provide a model for promoting resilience in the face of stress. These underlie the currently available evidence-based interventions for depression. These theories provide a basis for the development of prevention programmes and an understanding of the mechanisms by which they achieve a reduction in the rates of the onset of depression.</P>
<P>Beck developed cognitive behavioural therapy based on his cognitive model of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1976</LINK>). He proposed that individuals prone to depression have cognitive distortions that result in a negative view of themselves, the world and the future. In CBT, people learn to identify, explore and modify relationships between negative thinking, behaviour and depressed mood. This is achieved by learning to identify and monitor the intensity of different moods in themselves, recognising thoughts and behaviours that have contributed to this mood, and learning how to address these by evaluating and challenging unhelpful thoughts and engaging in behaviour that contributes to improved mood. The associated concepts of 'attributional style' (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 1978</LINK>) and 'learned helplessness' (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seligman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seligman 1979</LINK>) have also contributed to components of CBT. Those with a pessimistic attributional style see negative events as a stable and enduring part of themselves, while positive events are seen as transient occurrences in which they have played no part. Learned helplessness is a phenomenon of withdrawal with depression the result of a perceived failure or inability to control aversive events. Both are associated with a sense of helplessness and hopelessness, which leads to passivity in the face of challenges and contributes to low mood (<LINK REF="REF-McCauley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCauley 2001</LINK>). People who are prone to depression are then less likely to take an active approach to dealing with difficulties. CBT also tends to include a component of effective problem-solving.</P>
<P>Interpersonal conflict, difficulty with role transitions and experiences of loss are all well known as risk factors in the development of depressive disorder in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCauley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCauley 2001</LINK>). IPT helps a person resolve interpersonal problems through a range of techniques and thereby increases a person's access to social support and decreases interpersonal stress, which improves emotional processing and interpersonal skills and ultimately improves symptoms via a range of mechanisms. There are a number of specific techniques that can be used, such as helping the client to express and explore different emotions within social situations, encouraging them to develop supportive relationships with others outside of the therapeutic context, and using role play to allow the client to 'test out' and improve on their communication style (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>While evidence is yet to be clearly established in young people, 'third wave CBT' approaches are becoming popular. These approaches are characterised (in comparison with CBT) by techniques that target the process, rather than content of thoughts, helping people to become aware of and accept their thoughts in a non-judgemental way (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann 2010</LINK>). They include such interventions as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2003</LINK>), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) (<LINK REF="REF-Teasdale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasdale 1995</LINK>), dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) (<LINK REF="REF-Linehan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linehan 1993</LINK>), and the expanded model of behavioural activation (BA) (<LINK REF="REF-Martell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martell 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Since the previous update of the review was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>), there have been a large number of trials of preventive interventions for depression in children and adolescents. Between publication of the original review in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2004b</LINK>) and the publication of the update in 2011, the findings changed slightly from showing that targeted programmes were potentially effective in preventing depression for young people, with more mixed results from universal programmes, to supporting both targeted and universal depression prevention programmes as having the potential to prevent depression. With so many new trials published, it is possible that the results could change. It is also the case that many of the most promising approaches to depression prevention have been difficult to replicate in large-scale pragmatic efficacy trials (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Araya-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araya 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stallard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallard 2012</LINK>). Governments are keen to take action to address the burden of depression on society, and its relationship to suicide attempts and completed suicide. It is critical that depression prevention programmes that are implemented are based on the evidence and represent the best possible approach of all those that have been tested to data for maximum benefit. It is timely to re-evaluate the evidence currently available for the efficacy of depression prevention programmes as well as to explore how different therapeutic approaches may modify overall prevention effects. This version of the review therefore includes a more homogeneous group of trials by excluding trials of psychoeducational interventions, interventions delivered to those who have suffered trauma and interventions that are primarily aimed at preventing anxiety. It is important that this review, with more limited inclusion criteria, is undertaken in order to help direct governments to the most promising approach to depression prevention.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:08:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To determine whether evidence-based psychological interventions (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and third wave CBT)) are effective in preventing the onset of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.</P>
<P>We included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>universal interventions; and</LI>
<LI>targeted interventions aimed at young people at risk of developing a depressive disorder. Within these targeted intervention trials we investigated the impact of the type of targeted approach (indicated versus selected) on the overall treatment effect of targeted interventions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We also separately investigated the impact of the type of control group on the overall treatment effect within the targeted and universal trials.</P>
<P>Finally, we undertook exploratory analyses, using meta-regression, to further investigate whether the type and intensity or other components of the intervention or baseline severity of depression impacted on the overall treatment effect.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>We included trials if participants were children and adolescents whose mean aged fell within the range of 5.0 to 19.9 years There were no restrictions on gender or ethnicity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>We included studies if participants did not currently meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder.</P>
<P>There were three ways of selecting participants for trial inclusion that were eligible for this review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>trials that recruited an unselected population of participants regardless of their level of depressive symptoms (i.e. 'universal' programmes);</LI>
<LI>trials that recruited participants on the basis of a specific risk factor for depression, such as the death of a parent, parental conflict or a family history of depression (i.e. 'selected' programmes);</LI>
<LI>trials in which participants had elevated levels of depressive symptoms according to scores on standardised, validated scales of depression (i.e. 'indicated' programmes).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We included studies that included participants with a history of a depression if the intervention was aimed at the prevention of depression in a non-clinical setting, and where the participants were not being currently treated for depression. Although this is not a purist definition of prevention, in fact the majority of included trials did not rigorously assess whether or not participants had a history of depressive disorder while some of the best designed included trials that we identified did do this. It was illogical to exclude those trials that did assess whether or not participants had a history of depressive disorder, given that the participants in the other trials were likely to have also included young people with past episodes of depressive disorder that had been unrecognised and untreated.</P>
<P>We excluded studies if they lacked a clear definition of participants, included children and adolescents who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV (DSM-IV-TR) (<LINK REF="REF-American-Psychiatric-Association-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Psychiatric Association 2000</LINK>) or International Classification of Diseases<B> (</B>ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2007</LINK>) criteria for depressive disorder, were clearly designed to be treatment trials or where there was no adequate assessment of participants.</P>

<P>We excluded trials in which participants were recruited primarily with respect to other psychological problems (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, substance use, insomnia) or physical illnesses (e.g. diabetes or HIV) but where depression was a potential comorbid issue and was therefore measured as a secondary outcome measure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Experimental intervention</HEADING>
<P>As recommended in the Institute of Medicine Report (<LINK REF="REF-Mrazek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mrazek 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2009</LINK>), we classified prevention as those interventions that occurred prior to the onset of a clinically diagnosable disorder and this could include interventions for individuals with elevated symptoms of disorder but who did not currently meet the criteria for a clinical disorder.</P>
<P>In a previous version of this review, we included both psychological and educational interventions. However, in this version of the review we have only included evidence-based psychological interventions. CBT and IPT have been established as efficacious in treatment and most prevention researchers have built on this in prevention. Indeed, the majority of trials included in the previous version were CBT-based and restricting inclusion as we have done in this version ensures greater homogeneity, therefore enabling us to explore the impact of different approaches within these broad categories on the overall treatment effect. Therefore, we only included trials investigating the efficacy of CBT-oriented (including problem-solving interventions (PST) and third wave CBT) or IPT-oriented (or combination) or other similar approaches in the review.</P>
<P>We had an inclusive approach to these included therapies so that, for example, an intervention might only include one of a range of the CBT techniques in isolation (e.g. only cognitive restructuring, or only monitoring mood in relation to activities), but was still included as being CBT-based. Problem-solving techniques are often included in CBT interventions, but can also be delivered in isolation, for example problem-solving therapy (PST). Third wave therapies included mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT), positive psychology and any purely behavioural approaches.</P>
<P>The number of sessions delivered and the way interventions were delivered could vary. In most cases, interventions were delivered in groups, but given the increasing use of new media to deliver interventions these modes of delivery as well as traditional face-to-face individual and group-based interventions are included. Trials had to implement the majority of an intervention primarily to the child/adolescent themselves, either in individual or group-based sessions. We therefore excluded trials that delivered an intervention for parents with the aim of impacting on parenting practices and, subsequently, depressive symptoms in their child, without any sessions delivered to the child themselves.</P>
<P>We excluded interventions targeted at helping children to manage the consequences of a specific event or situation (e.g. divorce). However, we included trials in cases where the intervention was sufficiently broad and participants were taught skills that could be applied to a wide variety of problematic situations.</P>
<P>We excluded secondary and tertiary interventions, including relapse prevention and pharmacological interventions for depression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparator intervention</HEADING>
<P>The comparison groups that were eligible for inclusion in this review, in order of increasing rigorousness, were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>treatment as usual (TAU), defined as the normal healthcare curriculum, physical education classes or the ability to access any school-based and/or external mental health care as required;</LI>
<LI>no treatment (NT);</LI>
<LI>wait-list (WL);</LI>
<LI>attention placebo (AP), defined by <LINK REF="REF-Merry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2006</LINK> (p.178) as &#8220;controlling for non-specific factors&#8230;.which we would not expect to affect factors specifically implicated in the aetiology of depression.&#8221; These non-specific factors could include participating in a trial with a prescribed curriculum and materials and having time off regular classes. Attention placebo may include psychoeducation about general mental and/or physical health, however, the programmes would not target mood specifically. We rated the &#8216;credibility&#8217; of the AP (i.e. how well-matched it is to the intervention and how well it would control for likely non-specific factors of the intervention); and</LI>
<LI>other, which may include brief psychoeducation and/or information and support but does not include another psychological intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We excluded head-to-head trials where CBT, IPT or third wave CBT was only compared to another type of psychological intervention as our primary aim was to examine the efficacy of these interventions in preventing depression.</P>

<P>In the first update of the review, <LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>, we excluded general adjustment, academic/work function, social adjustment, cognitive style and suicidal ideation/attempts outcomes given the paucity of data that existed for these outcomes in the first version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2004b</LINK>). In this version of the review we have included clinician-rated depression symptoms because, while the majority of trials use self-rated measures, a good minority of trials also use a clinician-rated measure and it is important to assess the impact on depression according to different raters. We have been able to reinstate an outcome related to our early functioning outcomes, but have only included general functioning, again due to the paucity of outcomes for more specific categories of functioning. We have also now included anxiety because of the high co-morbidity between depression and anxiety.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:21:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>For the original version of this review, two independent authors assessed methodological quality using the quality rating scale devised by Moncrieff and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2006</LINK>); those trials scoring 30 or more were deemed 'high' quality, those scoring 23 or more were deemed 'adequate' with sensitivity analysis undertaken on this basis.</P>
<P>For the current version of the review, we updated our methods to conform to the current version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Specifically, we examined each trial for random sequence generation method, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors, the methods of addressing incomplete outcome data and potential selective reporting. For the domain of 'other potential sources of bias' we assessed the independence of the investigators (were the investigators independent of those who developed the intervention) and implementation integrity (were sessions taped and rated, was the integrity reported and was it adequate).</P>
<P>Two review authors (two of either SH, JB or KW) independently performed all assessments of the risk of bias. A third author (GC) resolved any discrepancies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>We pooled dichotomous data using the risk difference (RD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We have used the risk difference as we consider that this is the most relevant measure for this analysis. Our primary question is whether the onset of an episode of a depressive disorder is lower following an intervention. If an intervention is successful, the absolute number of participants with a diagnosis of depressive disorder following the intervention will be lower than those with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder in the control group. The risk difference is easy to interpret and can be converted to number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB), which is meaningful when considering whether or not depression prevention is likely to be an effective public health intervention. We made an a priori decision to include the NNTB for the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium-term follow-up as a way of interpreting the results for the reader.</P>

<P>For all cluster-randomised trials we adjusted for the effects of clustering following the procedure outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>, section 16.3.4. Where information on the interclass correlation (ICC) was not reported within the text of a trial, we contacted trial authors to request this information. Where we were unable to obtain this information from the trial authors, we used an ICC estimate of 0.0282, as this represents the average of the ICCs obtained from the other trials included in the analysis. Where a trial/s presented a range of ICC or design effect values, and where it was unclear which value applied to a given outcome or time point, we used the higher value in order to calculate the most conservative sample size.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multi-arm trials</HEADING>
<P>Where a trial/s had more than one evidence-based intervention arm compared with a single control group, we chose the intervention arm that was the most active. Where there was more than one eligible intervention within a class (i.e. CBT, IPT), we chose the most intense in terms of the intervention that had the most intervention components or was longer, or both.</P>
<P>Where a trial/s included multiple comparator arms, we extracted data from the most rigorous control group to ensure the estimated treatment effect was not inflated, following the hierarchy of comparator rigorousness outlined in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> section.</P>
<P>As the previous version of this review found that the magnitude of effect for depression prevention programmes is similar between boys and girls, we have combined data by gender where a trial/s presented data separately for boys and girls. Additionally, as other work has found no evidence of moderation by ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Marchand-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchand 2010</LINK>), we have also combined data where a trial/s presented data separately for members of different ethnicity. Further, our interest was in examining factors related to the type of intervention and methods that might impact on the overall treatment effects (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK> section).</P>

<P>It is common for authors to report using intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses to account for missing data, although it is generally the case that the data presented and extracted for the meta-analysis were raw data. Where it is not clear whether an ITT analysis was undertaken, or where data were reported based on adjusted means (or it was unclear), we contacted trial authors to obtain the raw mean and standard deviations (SDs) based on available information. In most cases, therefore, data extracted and used within meta-analyses are based on observed case data.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2011 version of this review</HEADING>
<P>Sixty-eight trials (from 66 publications) were included in the 2011 version of this review. For the 2015 update, we combined the data referenced in the 2011 update as <LINK REF="STD-Cardemil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cardemil 2002</LINK>a and <LINK REF="STD-Cardemil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cardemil 2002</LINK>b (now <LINK REF="STD-Cardemil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cardemil 2002</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 1993</LINK>a and 1993 (now <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 1993</LINK>). We received further information with regards to the randomisation procedure used in two previously excluded trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jaycox-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jaycox 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowalenko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kowalenko 2005</LINK>), and one trial previously classified as awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Gallegos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gallegos 2008</LINK>). In all cases the authors confirmed that they did randomise schools or individuals (or both) to intervention and control group. As a result, these three trials have now been included in the current review.</P>
<P>As the inclusion criteria for this update were changed to ensure a more homogeneous group of trials specifically targeting the prevention of depression, we have now excluded 26 previously included trials.

<P>Eighty-three trials were eligible for inclusion. We obtained data suitable for pooling for meta-analysis from 76 trials for at least one of the included primary or secondary outcomes either from the published paper or via correspondence with trial authors. For the primary outcomes, we obtained data suitable for pooling for self-reported depression scores at the post-intervention assessment from 70 independent trials (73 independent trial arms) and, for diagnosis of depressive disorder at the medium-term assessment, we obtained data suitable for pooling from 32 trials.</P>
<P>Seven trials did not provide data suitable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Karami-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karami 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khalsa-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khalsa 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lillevoll-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lillevoll 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-No_x00eb_l-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Noël 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoppelbein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stoppelbein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2014</LINK>).

For <LINK REF="STD-Khalsa-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khalsa 2012</LINK>, change scores were reported with no information on baseline scores for the depression measure provided. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-No_x00eb_l-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Noël 2013</LINK>, although the authors provided information on the number of treatment dropouts for the overall sample, the number of participants remaining in the intervention and control groups at the post-intervention assessment was unclear. For <LINK REF="STD-Stoppelbein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stoppelbein 2003</LINK>, data were only reported for the total sample and subsamples, rather than for the intervention and control groups specifically. For <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2014</LINK>, 72.8% of data were missing at post-intervention, due to either attrition or data corruption. Given this, we decided not to include data from the trial in any analysis. The implications for this decision are that there are missing data and it is unclear what the impact on the results of the review would be if we had these data and could include them in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The inclusion of two trials from the original review, <LINK REF="STD-Hyun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hyun 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmiege-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmiege 2006</LINK>, involved substantial discussion between the two authors that screened the trials (GC and SH) and a third co-author (SM). While the aim of these trials was not depression prevention per se, they were clearly targeting factors closely associated with onset of depression in groups who are at high risk of depression (in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Schmiege-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmiege 2006</LINK> this was preventing grief with the aim of preventing depression, and in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Hyun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hyun 2005</LINK>, participants were youths residing in a shelter), and depression was one of the key outcomes in each of these trials. Significant discussion also occurred with regards to the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Kauer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kauer 2012</LINK>. This intervention involved daily monitoring of activity and mood, however it was unclear whether this information was fed back to young people themselves, in addition to GPs, and therefore whether it constituted a behavioural intervention. We felt that the act of monitoring one's actions in and of itself was sufficient to be classed as a behavioural intervention, particularly given evidence of the efficacy of this self-management behaviour for preventing relapse of depression in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ekers-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekers 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were a number of trials with multiple eligible intervention arms. For

For a further three (<LINK REF="STD-Gilham-1994_x002d_Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Gilham 1994-Study 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lillevoll-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lillevoll 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2001</LINK>), although trial authors tested different components or approaches to the same intervention, we also combined data across these arms as the evaluation of the efficacy of treatment components is beyond the scope of this review.</P>
<P>Four trials reported data for more than one eligible arm within an intervention class (i.e. CBT, IPT) (<LINK REF="STD-Rohde-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Rohde 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohde-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Rohde 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2010</LINK>).

For the first trial, we calculated the sample size on the basis of the percentage of families retained by the post-intervention assessment. For the 12-month (medium-term) assessment, we have used the same sample size as reported for the depression diagnosis outcome. For the second trial, as the number of participants with information on all post-intervention outcomes was presented as a range of values (i.e. 42 to 47 in the intervention group and 40 to 43 in the control group), we have used the middle value (i.e. 45 and 42) as the sample size.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a description of what intervention components were included in each intervention tested in the trials included in this review. For one trial, due to time and resource limitations, we were unable to arrange for the treatment manual to be translated. We have therefore not categorised the components of this treatment in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Mirzamani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mirzamani 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of prevention programmes were CBT-based (k = 65). However, within this broad class of intervention there was significant variation in terms of the emphasis of the components delivered.

<P>The majority of these interventions were delivered face-to-face (only 10 trials used a purely individual approach and the remainder were group approaches); only eight were delivered in an online format (<LINK REF="STD-Calear-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calear 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lillevoll-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lillevoll 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makarushka-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Makarushka 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manicavasagar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Manicavasagar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2014</LINK>).

<P>For one further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cowell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cowell 2009</LINK>), the duration of the treatment period was unclear. We as review authors were therefore unable to determine which time point/s indicated the post-intervention and/or follow-up assessments. Finally, in <LINK REF="STD-Lillevoll-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lillevoll 2014</LINK> the intervention consisted of delivery of the five modules of MoodGYM. However, only 8.54% of those allocated to MoodGym actually logged in.</P>
<P>The intervention called the beyondblue Secondary Schools Research Initiative is notable because it was delivered during a single school term over a three-year period in conjunction with school-wide intervention components including, for example, interventions to improve the quality of social interactions among all members of the school community, interventions to facilitate adolescents&#8217; access to support and professional services at school and in the wider community and community forums to provide information about how to identify potential problems and seek help for these (<LINK REF="STD-Sawyer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawyer 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trials excluded from the updated search</HEADING>
<P>Of the 175 full-text articles retrieved, we consolidated references into respective studies for which there were multiple references (<LINK REF="REF-Buhler-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhler 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishikawa-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ishikawa 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Voorhees-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Voorhees 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasserman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasserman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williford 2012</LINK>), after which we excluded 206 studies from the review. We excluded 31 studies as the mean age of participants was not within our specified age bracket, 35 contained an intervention that focused on trauma or PTSD, 19 contained an intervention that focused on broad mental health and/or wellbeing, 15 were not RCTs, 17 did not employ a suitable psychological intervention (e.g. equine therapy), 16 were targeted to the treatment, rather than prevention of depression, 11 did not deliver the intervention primarily to the individual child/adolescent (e.g. employed family therapy or focused on parenting skills), nine did not contain a suitable comparison condition, 10 did not contain a specific depression outcome measure, seven employed interventions targeted at postpartum depression or dysfunctional attachment styles, eight employed interventions focused on anxiety, six employed interventions focused on either chronic pain, or a physical health issue, four recruited participants on the basis of depressive or anxious symptoms, three studies focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle, three employed interventions primarily targeting disruptive behaviours, two focused on dealing with the effects of divorce, one described the development of an intervention, one was targeted to prevent bipolar disorder, one was a treatment for insomnia, one intervention focused on early childhood abuse, one focused on bullying and one was a review for which there were no data.</P>
<P>Some trials received significant discussion between the authors as to whether they should be included in the review. The study by <LINK REF="STD-McBride-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2012</LINK> used &#8220;cognitively based psychoeducation&#8221; in which participants were taught about cognitive distortions (as well as depression symptoms) and asked to identify these distortions in vignettes. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Marcotte-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marcotte 1993</LINK> was also similar in that children listened to a scenario, and then discussed the irrational beliefs contained within it. We excluded these two studies on the basis that within the traditional CBT approach, individuals are required to work with their own thoughts and to engage in cognitive restructuring or some technique that will result in changing their own behaviours and/or cognitions.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2012</LINK> was primarily a family intervention, and many of the components focused on families identifying and managing depression and co-occurring substance use. As the intervention contained just one session (out of 10) that was delivered to the adolescent (the remaining nine were either delivered to the entire family or to the parent alone), we excluded it on the basis of that it did not focus sufficiently on the adolescent themselves.</P>
<P>The FRIENDS programme was originally designed to prevent childhood anxiety. Although the previous version of this review included trials of the FRIENDS programme as the programme's effects on depression symptoms is also typically assessed, in this update of the review we sought to include only those interventions in which the primary focus was to prevent depression. Therefore we also excluded several previously included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Balle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowry_x002d_Webster-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry-Webster 2003</LINK>), and subsequent studies identified in the updated search.</P>

We also included an additional 40 trials from the updated search.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>For 19 trials, we rated this item as low risk of bias as appropriate methods to conceal allocation were used. A variety of methods of concealment were used, including: using a independent researcher/statistician to generate the randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Calear-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calear 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kindt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kindt 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manicavasagar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Manicavasagar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCarty-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCarty 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Merry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-No_x00eb_l-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Noël 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawyer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawyer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stallard-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stallard 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijnhoven-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wijnhoven 2014</LINK>), sealed, opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Compas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Compas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaycox-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jaycox 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCarty-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCarty 2011</LINK>), unique ID numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>), sequentially numbered mobile phones (<LINK REF="STD-Kauer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kauer 2012</LINK>), or a computerised randomisation procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2012</LINK>).

We rated one further trial as unclear risk of bias as it could not be determined if allocation was adequately concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Araya-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Araya 2013</LINK>). For a second, it was unclear if the project co-ordinators were independent of the research team and, by extension, whether allocation could have been adequately concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Rohde-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Rohde 2014b</LINK>). We rated five as at high risk of bias for this item, as authors, clinicians, project co-ordinators or teachers involved in the research project undertook allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Lillevoll-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lillevoll 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLaughlin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McLaughlin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivet_x002d_Duval-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rivet-Duval 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohde-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Rohde 2014a</LINK>), or because correspondence with trial authors revealed that although students' names were concealed, the allocation sequence itself was not (<LINK REF="STD-Livheim-2014_x002d_study-1_x0028_girls_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Livheim 2014-study 1(girls)</LINK>).</P>

<P>The effect size for reduction of depression diagnosis overall at medium-term follow-up (primary outcome), translates to a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 33 (22 to 148).</P>
<P>For the medium-term follow-up assessment (the primary outcome) the quality of the evidence, as assessed using the GRADE criteria, was moderate (see 
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence that the way in which populations were selected for intervention (i.e. universal versus targeted) modified the efficacy of these prevention programmes at either post-intervention (Chi² = 0.68; df = 1; P value = 0.41; I² = 0%), medium-term (Chi² = 3.00; df = 1; P value = 0.08; I² = 66.6%) or long-term follow-up (Chi² = 0.63; df = 1; P value = 0.43; I² = 0%) assessments.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-19 12:38:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>In this more specific review we attempted to focus on studies likely to be more homogeneous in their approach and findings, and to identify some of the factors that might inform attempts at implementation. The studies were all of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) or third wave CBT approaches, and the majority were conducted in schools and delivered to groups.</P>
<P>The overall results again showed small positive benefits in terms of depression prevention, for both the primary outcomes of self-rated depressive symptoms post-intervention and depression diagnosis up to 12 months (but not beyond). The results for the secondary outcomes, including anxiety and general functioning, were broadly consistent with these findings, again with little effect seen beyond 12 months; however it should be noted that for anxiety and functioning there were limited data. Estimates of numbers needed to treat to benefit compare well with other public health interventions. However, which programmes should be implemented, and how, is not clear. In addition, the evidence was of moderate to low quality using the GRADE framework and the results were heterogeneous.</P>
<P>A key consideration in the field is whether to provide interventions to universal or targeted populations. There were significantly larger effects for targeted programmes in terms of reduced depression symptom severity but not for reduction in depressive disorder. A larger effect for indicated targeted interventions is, of course, to be expected because of the higher levels of depression at the start of the intervention. However, the evidence from this review is unclear with regard to whether the type of population modified the overall effects, with significant differences when comparing targeted and universal interventions for depression symptoms but not for depressive disorder. In terms of the practical implementation of programmes, we therefore summarise the results separately for universal and targeted interventions:</P>
<P>For <B>universal</B> interventions there was no evidence of an effect:</P>
<UL>
<LI>in reduction of depressive disorder at medium-term follow-up (primary outcome) or at other time points (post-intervention assessment, or at short- medium- or long-term follow-up);</LI>
<LI>in reduction of depression symptoms beyond post-intervention assessment (primary outcome) (i.e. at short-, medium- or long-term follow-up).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For <B>targeted</B> approaches there is evidence of an effect:</P>
<UL>
<LI>in reduction of depressive disorder at medium-term follow-up (primary outcome), post-intervention assessment and short-term follow-up, but not at long-term follow-up;</LI>
<LI>in reduction of depression symptoms at post-intervention assessment (primary outcome) and at short- and medium-term but not long-term follow-up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, when clinicians rated the effect on depression symptoms for targeted interventions (data were available at post-intervention assessment, and medium- and long-term follow-up), rather than participants themselves, there was little evidence of an effect beyond post-intervention assessment.</P>
<P>The issue of the lack of attention placebo comparisons is important. Although statistical analyses did not show a moderation effect by comparison group for either of our primary outcomes, this may reflect differences in comparison groups. There were a number of studies of universal interventions with an attention placebo control group and the analyses showed a lack of heterogeneity and a complete lack of effect. There were far fewer trials of targeted interventions using an attention placebo condition and none for our primary outcome of depressive disorder. There were trials using an attention placebo control for our other primary outcome, depression symptoms, and again this individual subgroup showed no effect.</P>
<P>Within the targeted studies our analysis generates an interesting hypothesis that interventions targeted to those with elevated symptoms, rather than risk alone, will result in larger effects but, again, the lack of attention placebo control comparisons for these studies should be noted.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect size in comparison with the previous version of this review</HEADING>
<P>Overall the risk of a diagnosis of depression was reduced from 19.3% to 16.2%. The effect size for reduction in a diagnosis of depression overall at medium-term follow-up translates to a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 33 (22 to 148). These results are different from the NNTB of 11 shown in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>). However, a recent review of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events reported that the NNTB to prevent one major cardiovascular event over a mean follow-up of 6.8 years was 284 and the NNTB to prevent one stroke over 6.8 years was 614 (<LINK REF="REF-Xie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xie 2014</LINK>). For antihypertensives for those with hyper- or pre-hypertensive blood pressure the NNTB to prevent one stroke over a median of 4.3 years was 169<B> (</B>
<LINK REF="REF-Sipahi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sipahi 2012</LINK>). In both cases, the conclusions of the respective studies were that aspirin and antihypertensives were of benefit. Given the burden of depression, prevention programmes could still be a worthwhile investment in public health terms, particularly those aimed at targeted populations. The skills taught in these programmes are also useful life skills and have applicability throughout the life course for a range of psychological problems. However, of the trials that measured depression diagnosis, only two used an attention placebo comparison and, consistent with the findings for depressive symptoms, there was no effect of the intervention in these trials.</P>
<P>Following the large trial conducted by Stallard&#8217;s team (<LINK REF="STD-Stallard-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stallard 2012a</LINK>), there has been concern that these interventions may do harm because the group that received the classroom-based CBT had more negative thinking at 12 months follow-up than those in the usual school provision arm. As is often the case with trials of psychotherapy, little attention has been paid to this possibility (<LINK REF="REF-Berk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berk 2009</LINK>). There is no evidence from the studies to date that these interventions cause worsening symptoms.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Issue of attention placebo comparisons</HEADING>
<P>As we have noted in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>), few trials have compared the intervention with an attention placebo. The placebo effect is high in studies of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Howick-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howick 2013</LINK>). The placebo-controlled trials in this review showed no evidence of effect. The significant effects were in those studies that compared intervention to treatment as usual, wait-list and 'other' comparison groups. There is also significant heterogeneity, except in the attention placebo subgroup analyses where heterogeneity is low. This all points to the worrying concern that the apparent effects of prevention may be placebo. Addressing this possibility is a priority for future studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presence of previous depression</HEADING>
<P>It is also important to consider whether the presence of previous episodes of depression modifies the treatment effect. Most trials do not consider whether participants have already had an episode of depressive disorder. From our previous work, the most effective trial reported was the targeted programme by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2001</LINK>, where the initial effect size equalled -0.46, resulting in a risk difference of -0.22 and a NNTB of five (<LINK REF="REF-Merry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2011</LINK>). Effects in this trial persisted to 12 months with an effect size of -0.53, a risk difference of -0.17 and a NNTB of six. This finding was replicated by <LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK>, with a NNTB of nine. The design of the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK> included populations selected on the basis of elevated symptoms <I>and</I> risk. <LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK> found that around 55% of participants had a lifetime episode of depressive episode prior to the intervention meaning that prevention had effectively been combined with relapse prevention in this trial. We therefore conducted sensitivity analyses and found that the small effects on depression diagnosis were reduced to non-significance following the omission of those trials in which participants had had a previous episode of depressive disorder. The effects that we are seeing may therefore represent early intervention or even relapse prevention effects, a possibility supported by the fact that participants' baseline severity of depression in many of the included trials indicated at least mild symptoms of depression. This may not matter in practice. The majority of young people with a depressive disorder do not receive professional help from clinical services (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merikangas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merikangas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2007</LINK>). Interventions rolled out in settings such as school may therefore help to address this unmet need.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What to implement?</HEADING>
<P>Scalability of these interventions is an important consideration. Many programmes designed for scalability have failed to show an effect (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Araya-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Araya 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stallard-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stallard 2012a</LINK>), while, for example, the two-stage screening used by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK> would be difficult to implement in a community-based setting.</P>
<P>Various technology advances offer promise with regard to rolling out efficacious interventions with fidelity. Already there are a number of preventive interventions that have been delivered via the internet. However, the potential for poor adherence with interventions delivered online and the challenges of delivering software over multiple devices and platforms must also be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2009</LINK>). In this review, one of the included trials of an online programme (MoodGYM) found that only 8.54% of those allocated to the intervention actually logged into the service. Innovative approaches such as the incorporation of gaming elements (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2014</LINK>) and social networking (<LINK REF="REF-Rice-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 2014</LINK>) may increase engagement and adherence. However, even with adequate adherence to either face-to-face or online interventions, attending/completing sessions does not necessarily mean that a young person is acquiring or mastering the skills taught. Few trials of psychological treatments or interventions have thus far examined the potential mediators of benefit on depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Weersing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weersing 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of interest to us was a novel intervention approach tested in two of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Castellanos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Castellanos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Leary_x002d_Barrett-2013" TYPE="STUDY">O'Leary-Barrett 2013</LINK>). In these trials a CBT-based intervention was used but was adapted to particular personality factors that defined four high-risk groups (hopelessness, impulsive, sensation seeking and anxiety sensitive). Due to the strict inclusion criteria for this review we could only include data for the participants considered at risk of depression. However, the intervention reduced depression scores in all four high-risk groups, suggesting that effects were not specific. This suggests that there is room for innovation in terms of targeting prevention programmes in this way to prevent depression. Depressed populations are heterogeneous for risk factors and precipitating events that may have increased the risk of developing depression, suggesting that it may be unrealistic to expect that a single intervention approach would be beneficial for everyone.</P>
<P>In this update of the review we have taken a more targeted approach to try to identify the most efficacious approaches to depression prevention. We showed that neither the mode of delivery (i.e. face-to-face including group or individual combined versus online/telephone) nor the type of facilitator who delivered the intervention had any material impact on the magnitude of the overall treatment effect. In future updates it may be important to consider the impact of group compared with individually delivered interventions, bearing in mind the implications in terms of scalability. IPT interventions had the largest effect sizes but there were very few trials of IPT, and the trial by <LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 2007</LINK> showed no difference between CBT and IPT (<LINK REF="STD-Horowitz-a2007" TYPE="STUDY">Horowitz a2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horowitz-b2007" TYPE="STUDY">Horowitz b2007</LINK>). The vast majority of included trials employ a CBT-based intervention, with few trials of IPT or third wave CBT. This is also true of the treatment trials for depression in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Callahan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 2012</LINK>), and is surprising given that IPT is recommended in guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). Overall, given the paucity of trials of different approaches, it is challenging to conclude which is the most promising approach to roll out in a public health intervention. Our findings suggest that further studies of IPT-based preventive interventions would be worthwhile.</P>
<P>Meta-regression analyses showed little reduction in the risk of a diagnosis of depression for those with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline. The magnitude of intervention effects for depression symptoms in universal trials was modified by the intensity of intervention (hours) with longer interventions associated with smaller effect sizes. We also visually inspected the effect sizes of self-rated and clinician-rated depression in those trials that reported both and at each time point the effect sizes for self-rated depression were larger. Such factors should be tested in further trials.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-19 12:40:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Generally the data in the trials were clearly reported or authors were happy to provide us with extra data, or both.</P>
<P>Of the 83 trials included in this review, only 36 had data for the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium-term follow-up assessment, and there were even fewer trials that provided data for the long-term follow-up assessment (&gt; 12 months). Given that the presence of a depressive disorder has been most robustly linked to disability and cost (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>), it is the prevention of depressive disorder, with its resulting morbidity and mortality, that is critical. Two trials did measure very long-term outcomes at six and four years respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spence 2003</LINK>). Although these results were not included in this review, it is promising to note that in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Garber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garber 2009</LINK> (as referred to in Brent 2015) the positive impact of the depression prevention programme on incidents of depressive disorder was maintained at the six-year follow-up. This is in contrast to <LINK REF="STD-Spence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spence 2003</LINK>, who did not find an effect. Measuring depressive disorder over longer periods of follow-up is important given that the incident rate climbs during adolescence and into young adulthood <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK> and many of the interventions in this review are initially delivered in children or younger adolescents.</P>
<P>As discussed above, there are a much larger number of trials that use a credible attention placebo and little difference is shown between intervention and placebo. However, the majority of these were trials in universal populations and so it is harder to ensure that the findings from trials in targeted populations are not the result of the attention itself. The changes post-intervention could clearly represent a placebo effect. As the effects persist for up to 12 months, a placebo effect may be less likely, especially as nearly all the interventions are completed in 12 weeks or less. Well-designed, large trials of targeted interventions with an attention control group, particularly those that measure depression diagnosis at longer-term follow-up, are needed before we can settle this question.</P>
<P>It was pleasing to be able to include one trial undertaken in a low- to middle-income country (Nigeria; <LINK REF="STD-Bella_x002d_Awusah-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bella-Awusah 2015</LINK>). In screening the results of our search, we noticed a number of trials undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, most of which we had to exclude; for example, a trial of a life-skills programme for those at risk of suicide undertaken in Cambodia (<LINK REF="REF-Jegannathan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jegannathan 2014</LINK>). Interventions tested in high-income and Western countries may not be suitable or relevant for low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Carnevale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carnevale 2012</LINK>), but it is also the case that cost-effective school and community-based interventions are likely to be more relevant in these countries that have large services gaps for mental health provision (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2007b</LINK>). A recent systematic review examined the degree to which the small but positive effects of trials in universal depression interventions could be implemented in real world practice and highlighted a lack of generalisability given that all trials were conducted in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Carnevale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carnevale 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were unable to examine the efficacy of trials that incorporated cultural adaptations, but this would be critical in determining the nature of public health interventions that should be implemented.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-19 12:42:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There are some fundamental issues that limit our confidence in the findings from these trials.</P>
<P>We rated less than half of the trials included in this review as low risk of bias for random sequence generation or allocation concealment, suggesting that selection bias may be high. Sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of allocation concealment bias resulted in no material change to outcomes, except that the effect for universal programmes on self-rated depression scores was reduced to non-significance at the post-intervention assessment.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention and comparison conditions, performance and detection bias (for self-reported depression symptoms) is likely to be high in the majority of trials given that blinding of participants in most trials was not possible and that most trials relied on participant self-report depression symptoms as the outcome. For the primary outcome of depressive disorder at the medium-term follow-up assessment, data were determined by diagnostic assessment in around two-thirds of the included trials, of which we considered only a quarter as low risk of bias for this item. A diagnosis of depressive disorder was estimated by a cut-point on a self-rated depression symptom rating scale in the remaining trials and, given the range of tools and cut-points measured, with little clear literature to guide comparisons across tools and measures, there is some concern about how meaningful a cut-point on a self-rated scale is as a proxy measure for depression diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Stockings-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockings 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>We rated over half of the trials included in this review as high or unclear risk of bias for the domain of incomplete outcome data and we rated very few trials as low risk of bias for the domain of selective reporting. We were also only able to obtain trial protocols for 25.3% of trials and only eight trials had low risk of selective reporting.</P>
<P>In terms of other risks of bias, most trials were conducted by those that developed the intervention and therefore we rated these trials as high risk of bias for this item. Very few trials assessed intervention integrity adequately and few trials systematically reported on participant adherence to the planned intervention.</P>
<P>In summary, there are a number of serious short-comings in the studies.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-19 12:45:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This review used an extensive search strategy resulting in more studies than those uncovered by other recent reviews and it includes only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that use evidence-based psychological treatments for depression with a primary focus on preventing depression. Our analyses have taken into account the cluster-randomised design employed in many of the trials and ours is the largest review to date that has formally explored whether various factors such as how the population was selected for intervention (targeted versus universal), the comparison group (no treatment (NT), wait-list (WL), treatment as usual (TAU), attention placebo (AP)), baseline severity of depression, and the intervention approach and techniques modify the magnitude of the overall intervention effects.</P>
<P>Findings with regard to depression symptoms are consistent with a number of previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merry-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merry 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spence-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 2007</LINK>), including a recently published review (<LINK REF="REF-Corrieri-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrieri 2014</LINK>). While reviews have consistently shown evidence that depression prevention interventions lead to reduction in symptoms, earlier reviews were cautious in their conclusions because few trials measured the impact on depression diagnosis. Our previous update highlighted a continuing paucity of studies that measured depression diagnosis. We now have 36 trials that measured diagnosis of a depressive disorder, or a proxy based on cut-off scores at medium-term follow-up showing significant effects, consistent with two meta-analyses of trials in participants older than in our review, which also showed a reduction in depression diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cuijpers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuijpers 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stice-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stice 2009</LINK>). However, in this review we have carefully considered the issue of the type of comparison group and note that there is no effect in trials in universal populations compared with attention placebo comparisons and there are no trials of interventions delivered to targeted populations that have used an attention placebo comparison.</P>
<P>A number of reviews employing a variety of methods (meta-analyses, narrative reviews) have shown that interventions delivered to targeted populations have a greater effect than those delivered to universal populations (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stice-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stice 2009</LINK>), although statistical testing of the modification of results by the type of population (targeted versus universal) has mostly not been done. We found evidence that the type of population modified the results for depression symptoms but not for depressive disorder. Two previous reviews have shown that while the effect sizes for targeted interventions were generally larger, the type of population did not significantly impact on the overall results (<LINK REF="REF-Cuijpers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuijpers 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jane_x002d_Llopis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jane-Llopis 2003</LINK>). In these studies little consideration was given to the type of control group. There have been few investigations of the impact of indicated targeted approaches compared to selective targeted approaches. Our findings that selective approaches are less effective than indicated approaches are in contrast to those of <LINK REF="REF-Cuijpers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuijpers 2008</LINK>, who found no differences and <LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 2006</LINK>, who found that selected, but not indicated, trials were significantly different from universal trials.</P>
<P>We included additional analyses of potential modifiers of treatment effect. We have shown that the length of intervention significantly modifies the magnitude of treatment effect in some analyses, with longer interventions less effective in reducing symptoms in universal interventions. Findings from other analyses are contradictory with longer interventions associated with larger effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Jane_x002d_Llopis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jane-Llopis 2003</LINK>), and shorter interventions associated with larger effects (<LINK REF="REF-Stice-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stice 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our findings, which show that who delivered the intervention did not moderate outcome, are consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Stice-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stice 2009</LINK> but different from those of <LINK REF="REF-Jane_x002d_Llopis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jane-Llopis 2003</LINK>, who showed that delivery by healthcare professionals produced larger effects.</P>
<P>Our finding that IPT approaches have the largest effect (albeit only tested in two trials) was also found by <LINK REF="REF-Cuijpers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuijpers 2008</LINK>, albeit that IPT was only tested in two trials.</P>
<P>Finally, we investigated whether the mode of delivery modified the overall treatment effects, given the increasing popularity of internet and other new media means to deliver interventions. A recent narrative review that included eight RCTs and non-randomised trials of four internet-based treatment programmes for anxiety or depression highlighted that these interventions showed promise (<LINK REF="REF-Calear-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calear 2010</LINK>). Our analysis shows that the mode of delivery does not modify the overall intervention effects, although there were a small number of trials classified as online or phone-based, and there are potentially issues with adherence and engagement (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-19 10:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. While depression prevention programmes overall are associated with a reduction in depression diagnosis and depressive symptoms at up to 12 months follow-up, with promising numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTBs), prevention programmes delivered to universal populations have a sobering lack of effect when compared with an attention placebo control. Interventions delivered to targeted populations, particularly those selected on the basis of depression symptoms, have larger effect sizes, but these studies have seldom used an attention placebo comparison. Further, there are practical difficulties inherent in the implementation of a targeted programme.</P>
<P>Where this has been investigated, trials in this review include participants with a past history of depressive episodes, so the effects being seen may be more properly considered to include treatment or relapse prevention rather than primary prevention. This is probably not of practical importance, given that the majority of young people with depressive disorder do not receive any intervention and are likely to benefit from the interventions. A real world reduction in diagnosis of a depressive disorder, be it primary prevention, treatment or relapse prevention, would be a worthwhile achievement given the burden of depression.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-24 11:08:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Are we there yet? Disappointingly no, despite the number of studies. The results from this review show that for approaches based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), there is a relative lack of evidence for universal interventions compared with attention placebo controls and well-conducted effectiveness trials of universal interventions have shown no evidence of effect (<LINK REF="STD-Araya-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Araya 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stallard-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stallard 2012a</LINK>). Targeted approaches appear the most likely to succeed, notwithstanding Rose's maxim that this approach is likely to miss a larger proportion of those at risk of depression than a targeted approach is likely to find (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1992</LINK>). However, this review has revealed a gap in the knowledge base in that depression prevention programmes have not been tested in targeted populations in trials with an appropriate attention placebo comparison group. We believe that depression prevention programmes should be tested in an indicated targeted population using an attention placebo group. CBT, and particularly IPT, approaches are worth pursuing; however, it may be worth thinking more widely about different approaches to tackling this important problem, such as approaches targeting personality risk factors, for example. We did not investigate age as a modifier, but it is likely that consideration of the age of onset is important in designing trials; it is possible that preventive interventions earlier in life may be efficacious in preventing depression during adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Rapee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapee 2013</LINK>), and it is important to measure the long-term outcomes of any prevention programme that is studied, preferably into early adulthood. Intensity of intervention was not found to be a significant modifier of intervention effect for targeted approaches and this requires further investigation.</P>
<P>Further, methodological weaknesses identified in this review should be addressed in future research including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>measurement of depressive disorder as a primary outcome and over the long term (at least 12 months or more);</LI>
<LI>use of a clinician-rated measure, as well as self-rated measures;</LI>
<LI>consideration of scalability; and</LI>
<LI>consideration of the potential to do harm, such as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>increasing depressive symptoms;</LI>
<LI>increasing negative cognitions; and</LI>
<LI>the potential for increasing self-harm and or suicidal thoughts/behaviours.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>The estimates of numbers needed to treat to benefit and the cost of depression to society mean that this is worth further study.</P>

<P>In the first version of the review, the protocol indicated that uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials, open trials, case-controlled trials and cohort trials (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2000</LINK>) would be included if there were no, very few, or only poor quality RCTs.

<P>In the first update of the review, we excluded general adjustment, academic/work function, social adjustment, cognitive style and suicidal ideation/attempts outcomes given the paucity of data that existed for these outcomes.

We added the clinician-rated depression symptom outcome because while the majority of trials use self-rated measures, a good minority of trials now included also used a clinician-rated measure and it is important to assess the impact on depression according to different raters. We have been able to reinstate our early outcomes related to functioning but have only included general functioning, again due to paucity of outcomes for more specific categories of functioning. We have also now included anxiety because of the high co-morbidity between depression and anxiety.</P>
<P>Assessment of the risk of bias was first updated in the previous update of the review and has been updated again in line with new guidance.</P>
<P>We made the decision prior to this version of the review to consider effect sizes of 0.20 or less as small, effect sizes that approached 0.30 as medium and effect sizes that approached 0.50 as large.</P>
<P>In this update of the review, we have aimed to have a more homogeneous group of included studies and thus have altered the inclusion criteria in the following ways:</P>
<P>We have only included psychological interventions (rather than educational).</P>
<P>We have only included evidence-based psychological interventions; the vast majority of studies in the previous versions of this review were CBT-based and continue to be so. Evidence-based interventions also include IPT interventions and we have included third wave CBT interventions.</P>
<P>Given the lack of significant findings with regard to gender and risk group, we have not undertaken subgroup analysis for these variables. We sought in this review to further the field of depression prevention by seeking to explore which of the many depression prevention programmes might be the most useful and this concentrated our subgroup analysis on how the populations for these trials were selected (universal, targeted: indicated and selected). Our meta-regression complemented this by looking at other salient features of the interventions that might impact on efficacy. Our other main concern was with regard to the important issue of comparison group, which time and time again has been shown to have an impact on effect sizes (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Weisz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisz 2006</LINK>). Thus we introduced a new subgroup analysis to investigate this.</P>

<P>During the course of this review update the authors have recognised that the review topic might now be better addressed in a series of separate intervention-specific reviews, including, but not limited to, a review of psychoeducation and education programmes for preventing depression in children and adolescents, a review of prevention trials undertaken in the aftermath of trauma and a review of trials where the primary aim is the prevention of anxiety.</P>

<P>Most studies used several depression rating scales or diagnostic interviews as outcome measures. For the purposes of pooling results to obtain an aggregate outcome, a single 'best available' outcome measure was chosen for each study. The order of selection was determined by the rating of each instrument over the following five criteria: appropriateness to children and adolescents; reliability; construct validity; agreement with clinical interview; track record in psychopharmacological research. Most of the data for this rating were obtained from a review by Petti (<LINK REF="REF-Petti-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petti 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The hierarchy of selection for analysis, and the number of criteria met by each rating scale (in parentheses), were as follows:</P>

<LI>Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (Kiddie-SADS), combined child and parent report;</LI>
