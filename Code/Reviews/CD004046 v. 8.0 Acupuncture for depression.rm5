Participants included adult men and women with depression diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), or Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (CCMD-3-R).

The effect of acupuncture compared with psychological therapy is unclear. The risk of adverse events with acupuncture is also unclear, as most trials did not report adverse events adequately. Few studies included follow-up periods or assessed important outcomes such as quality of life. High-quality randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to examine the clinical efficacy and acceptability of acupuncture, as well as its effectiveness, compared with acupuncture controls, medication, or psychological therapies.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-01 10:50:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-28 11:55:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P><BR/></P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-26 08:15:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Clinical depression is characterised by behavioural, cognitive, and emotional features. Depressed patients often exhibit signs of dysphoric mood, loss of interest in normally enjoyable pursuits, self-neglect and social withdrawal, poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue or loss of energy, low self-esteem, poor concentration or difficulty making decisions, and feelings of hopelessness.</P><P>Depression is recognised as a major public health problem that has a substantial impact on individuals and on society. Depressive disorders are common in the general population. In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of a major depressive disorder (MDD) has been reported at 16.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2007</LINK>). The World Health Organization has described depression as an "unseen burden" (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). MDD is associated with a significant loss of workdays (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2007</LINK>), as well as substantial role impairment in relation to household responsibilities, social life, and personal relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2003</LINK>). It has been demonstrated that those in the community who have depressive disorders experience reduced physical and mental functioning - similar to those seen with chronic diseases such as diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Hays-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hays 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>). In addition, mood disorders have been shown to have a greater impact on quality of life when compared with conditions such as hypertension and cardiac disease (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>). Depression is associated with considerable financial costs for health services and for society. The economic burden in England is estimated to exceed £9 billion per annum, with approximately £370 million accounting for direct costs of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-28 11:55:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>Major depression is a discrete episode of severe depression; when it is gone, the person is described as being in remission and feeling completely normal. Dysthymia is a pervasive 'low-level' depression that lasts a long time - frequently for a few years. Treatment approaches are the same for both conditions. Most depressed patients are treated in primary care and do not require hospitalisation. In primary care, depression is most often managed with antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1999</LINK>). A range of psychological interventions, including cognitive-behavioural therapies, interpersonal therapy, psychotherapy, and counselling, are also available. Surveys have shown that Australians report a preference for self-help and complementary therapies for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Jorm-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Jorm-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 2000</LINK>), and depressed persons in the United States report greater use of complementary therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2000</LINK>).</P><P>Acupuncture has a long history of use in China, Japan, and Korea. Contemporary acupuncture practice is commonly undertaken as part of the medical hospital system in modern China (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2012</LINK>), as part of traditional Korean medicine in South Korea (<LINK REF="REF-Woo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 2014</LINK>), and as a mix of hospital and private practice in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Hopton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopton 2012</LINK>). Traditional Chinese Medicine theory describes a state of health maintained by a balance of energy within the body. Acupuncture involves insertion of fine needles into different parts of the body to correct the imbalance of energy within the body. Styles of acupuncture range from traditional/classical acupuncture to auricular acupuncture, to trigger point acupuncture, to single-point acupuncture. Acupuncture is practised under several theoretical frameworks. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Classical Acupuncture are based on theoretical concepts of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements and explain disease and physiological function. A westernised medical application of acupuncture involves use of trigger points, segmental points, and commonly used formula points. Medical acupuncture may involve application of acupuncture based on the principles of neurophysiology and anatomy, rather than on TCM principles and philosophy. Auricular therapy involves using the ear to make a diagnosis and subsequent needling to points on the ear. Electro-acupuncture is defined as application of a small current through acupuncture needles. Laser acupuncture is a non-penetrative form of acupuncture that uses low-power laser light to stimulate acupuncture points. The rationale for treatment will determine the needling details (e.g. selection of points, number of needles used) and the method of stimulation (e.g. manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, laser acupuncture). Different styles of acupuncture may differ in their effectiveness, but little research has been conducted to directly examine effects on clinical outcomes when these parameters are changed (<LINK REF="REF-Armour-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armour 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Acupuncture is not entirely free of adverse events. Two large prospective surveys have been undertaken in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK> reported an incidence of 684 adverse events per 10,000 consultations. Most were minor events such as bleeding, needling pain, or aggravation of symptoms, and investigators have reported a low rate of significant adverse events (14 per 10,000). <LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2004</LINK> reported a rate of 107 adverse events per 1000 participants (95% confidence interval (CI) 100 to 115). Three participants reported a serious adverse event. Events most commonly reported were severe tiredness and exhaustion, pain at the site of needling, and headache. <LINK REF="REF-White-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2004</LINK> summarised the range and incidence of adverse events associated with acupuncture. Twelve prospective studies undertaken in the UK, Germany, Singapore, Japan, and Sweden surveyed more than a million treatments and found that risk of a serious adverse event with acupuncture was estimated to be 0.05 per 10,000 treatments, and 0.55 per 10,000 individual patients. Data from these studies suggest that the risks associated with acupuncture are few - a point reinforced by <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2001</LINK>, which concluded that acupuncture is safe in competent hands.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-26 08:23:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The cause of depression appears to be multi-factorial, and biological and psychosocial factors are involved (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2002</LINK>). Various interdependent biological components have been implicated in the onset and maintenance of MDD. Current models suggest that changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, dysfunction among stress hormones, and disequilibrium in neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine may be key factors (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Several mechanisms may explain the therapeutic effects of acupuncture within the current model of depression. Strong evidence obtained over the past three decades indicates that effects of acupuncture are mediated by various neurotransmitters, predominantly the endogenous opioid mechanism (EOM), catecholamines, and serotonin, and that an estimated 20 to 30 other neuropeptides are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2014</LINK>). Results from animal experiments suggest that, similar to antidepressant medications, acupuncture is capable of affecting neurotransmitter levels of serotonin and noradrenaline, along with the adenylate cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (AC-cAMP-PKA) cascade within the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2014</LINK>). In addition, acupuncture has produced structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) changes (as described by <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2012</LINK>) in the default mode network, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala-hippocampal formation (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009</LINK>). Dysfunction in these areas of the brain has been previously implicated in depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2015</LINK>). Manual acupuncture causes a broad range of central nervous system responses involving the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and other limbic structures as seen on fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) (<LINK REF="REF-Napadow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napadow 2005</LINK>). Electro-acupuncture is thought to deliver a greater 'dose' of acupuncture compared with manual acupuncture, as a result of the duration and intensity of stimulation, and to cause greater activation of endogenous opoid mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Mayor-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayor 2013</LINK>). This may or may not lead to greater clinical effects in non-pain-related conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Langevin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langevin 2015;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Mayor-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayor 2013</LINK>).

Thirteen trials used the DSM (II, III, IV, or V), 33 used the CCMD (2 or 3), and eight used ICD Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria. Ten trials recruited participants on the basis of a clinical presentation of depression. Two trials recruited participants only on the basis of BDI scores &#8805; 12, and four used HAMD scores alone.

Fourteen trials used a semi-standardised treatment protocol consisting of a predefined set of acupuncture points used in combination with acupuncture points selected on the basis of diagnosis and identification of symptomatic patterns. Four trials administered individualised treatment for study participants on the basis of their diagnosis.</P><P>A total of 42 trials reported needling duration between 20 and 30 minutes.

Electro-acupuncture treatment duration ranged from three to six weeks, and treatment was administered two days per week to daily in treatment sessions lasting from 30 to 60 minutes, with a total course of treatment ranging from nine to 42 sessions. Ten trials used a standard point prescription, and four were semistandardised, allowing some variation based on diagnosis. Manual acupuncture trials were equally diverse, treatment duration ranged from two to 12 weeks, and acupuncture was administered from once a week to twice daily in treatment sessions lasting from 20 to 60 minutes, with a total course of treatment lasting 12 to 60 sessions. Twenty-six trials used a standardised point prescription and eight used a semistandardised prescription; only three trials provided individualised treatment. Control acupuncture was also highly heterogeneous, with controls ranging from non-channel points, to points unrelated to depression, minimal insertion, placebo needles, mock electro-acupuncture, and mock laser acupuncture. Medication comparisons were less heterogeneous, with most trials describing administration of fluoxetine as the SSRI medication; however, investigators occasionally used other SSRIs such as paroxetine.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING><P>We proposed to undertake a sensitivity analysis of results to look at possible contributions of differences in risk of bias to robustness of the results, for example, by excluding trials with unclear concealment of random allocation; or excluding trials with greater than 20% dropout. Overall, we could not perform a sensitivity analysis for most comparisons because of lack of studies (fewer than five) in each group. When acupuncture was compared with medication, data show no significant change in the severity of depression when we removed studies unclearly describing randomisation (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.03, 21 trials, 1853 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%). Only two trials reported dropout greater than 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiting-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whiting 2008</LINK>), and we could not perform a sensitivity analysis. We planned an a posteriori sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of studies undertaken in China; however, removal of these studies left one or two trials remaining in each comparison and therefore would not provide any additional useful information.

We found evidence of greater side effects from medication alone than were reported with a combination of acupuncture plus medication. However, this outcome was not widely reported. Data provide evidence of reduced use of medication and improved aspects of quality of life in the acupuncture plus medication groups, although only a small number of studies reported on these outcomes.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Acupuncture compared with psychological therapy</HEADING><P>Researchers have provided no evidence of a difference in the severity of depression between acupuncture and a counselling intervention (low-quality evidence). Psychological treatment was followed by a greater dropout rate than was reported with acupuncture, but data show no evidence of an effect on other outcomes. The effect of acupuncture on secondary outcomes, which included remission of symptoms, dropout, reduced use of medication, and quality of life, is limited in that fewer studies reported on these outcomes.</P><P>For both primary and secondary outcomes, evidence was of moderate to very low quality as assessed by the GRADE approach, and trial results were heterogeneous. Many comparisons are characterised as having significant clinical and substantial or considerable statistical heterogeneity. This relates to dosing characteristics of the intervention and the heterogeneity of controls, including dosages of medication and degree of physiological activity of acupuncture controls. Within comparisons, we presented data by mode of acupuncture stimulation (manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and laser acupuncture). The direction of effects within comparisons was similar, possibly suggesting that specific treatment effects may be similar. Although comparisons between acupuncture and different controls are not consistent in their findings, most comparisons suggest a beneficial effect from acupuncture, although the potential for bias exists. Owing to small numbers of identified studies, we have been unable to identify treatment dose parameters that may moderate and influence treatment outcomes.</P><P>We have highlighted additional sources of bias throughout the review, but participants' expectations and their often unblinded status may play a role. For trials that reported no blinding, the expectation of effects may be greater and the placebo effect larger. For trials of depression with a known placebo effect in mild to moderate depression, the larger placebo effects that might be expected from acupuncture may lead to methodological challenges and increased awareness of the need to design studies that may detect a beneficial treatment effect of true acupuncture. Overall we found no evidence of differences in depression severity when clinicians rather than participants rated depression, except in a comparison for which participants were unblinded to treatment between acupuncture and no treatment/wait list/usual care. The influence of lack of blinding and expectations may contribute to these findings. Fewer studies examined the role of acupuncture compared with a control such as a sham procedure or device. Placebo-controlled trials included in this review show an overall small benefit derived from acupuncture compared with this control; however, heterogeneity is high and different controls may differ in terms of how inert or credible they are, or whether they produce a placebo effect. Addressing these differences is a priority suggested for future studies.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-02-28 12:26:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>Many styles of acupuncture may be provided, including individualised Traditional Chinese Medicine and approaches using standardised or semistandardised acupuncture points, as were used in most of the trials included in this review. This systematic review has documented wide variation in modes of stimulation, duration of needling, numbers of points used, depth of needling, and trial duration. Many studies administered suboptimal treatment doses of acupuncture. We also noted diversity in the clinical settings from which participants were recruited, and in trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most included trials were reported from China, and others were reported from Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States. Trials from China recruited participants largely from an inpatient or mixed inpatient-outpatient setting, and most of the studies conducted outside of China recruited participants from primary healthcare and community settings. It is unclear how treatment protocols used in this research may be generalisable to acupuncture as it is usually practised. We found insufficient reporting of the rationale for acupuncture used in the research setting. Variation may reflect the context in which acupuncture is practised. However, one pragmatic trial delivered a treatment intervention with high external validity and evidence of generalisability (<LINK REF="STD-MacPherson--2013" TYPE="STUDY">MacPherson 2013</LINK>).</P><P>Meta-analyses of clinical trials of antidepressant medication, in particular the new-generation antidepressants, show that treatment effects were clinically significant only with extremely depressed patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK>), and suggest that the pattern of treatment response may be attributed to a decrease in response to placebo rather than to an increase in response to medication. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that the placebo response in major depressive disorder is large, regardless of the intervention provided (<LINK REF="REF-Brunoni-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunoni 2009</LINK>). Acupuncture has been described as a complex intervention, and some of the incidental components of the effects of treatment may contribute to the placebo effect. We discuss this further in the section describing <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>.</P><P>It should also be noted that none of the primary studies of comparisons between acupuncture and medication have reported that the purpose of the research was to examine equivalence or non-inferiority, nor superiority. Many trials did not report on outcomes other than depression and did not consistently report adverse events; among these studies, we found that long-term follow up was scarce.</P><P>Many Chinese studies were poorly reported, and despite many attempts, we were unable to obtain complete details of study design features relevant to risk of bias assessment. Reporting on the primary outcome of severity of depression was high, although inclusion and reporting of other outcome measures was low. Follow-up data after trial completion were rarely provided. It is important that future trials include medium- and long-term follow-up, given the burden of disease and costs to the individual and society arising from depression. Given the placebo effect associated with depression and its treatment arising from attention, it is important that future trials include follow-up and provide data from follow-up periods.<BR/></P><P>Trials involving comparisons with medication have provided no data on compliance; therefore it is unclear whether outcomes of these study groups could have been affected by suboptimal doses of medication. In some cases, trials used medications currently removed from the market in some countries owing to safety issues and queries about lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Lv-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lv 2015;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>).</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 10:34:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall the quality of evidence for most comparisons was very low to moderate, limiting our confidence in trial findings. We rated few trials as having low risk of bias, and for most trials, we assigned a rating of high risk of bias in at least one domain.</P><P>We rated 75% of trials as having low risk of bias related to sequence generation, although we assessed most trials as having unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment.</P><P>High risk of bias was most frequently related to the domains of blinding. However for many comparisons, performance and detection bias is likely to be high because blinding of participants to the interventions provided was not feasible. This caused review authors to downgrade evidence by at least one level for most comparisons, and by two levels when both blinding domains were rated as high risk in at least a third of included studies. For several comparisons, we included only one clinical trial, causing a downgrade for lack of precision.</P><P>We rated more than half of trials as having low risk of bias for the domain of attrition bias. We assessed less than half of trials as having low risk of selective bias, and we were able to access published protocols for only a few trials.

Although some of the heterogeneity can be explained by heterogeneity among the interventions themselves, as well as among controls, this finding was often significant enough to result in downgrading of the level of evidence. We were unable to examine the effect of study quality through a sensitivity analysis because we found too few studies that were at low risk of bias.

Our updated findings differ significantly from those of <LINK REF="REF-Mukaino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukaino 2005</LINK>, which included seven trials and found no differences between acupuncture and a wait-list comparison, between acupuncture and sham acupuncture, or between electro-acupuncture and antidepressant medication. This difference is likely explained by the larger body of randomised controlled trials reported over time and by differences among trials meeting the inclusion criteria for our review.</P><P>One systematic review - <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK> - found that acupuncture was superior to antidepressant medication for patients who had experienced post-stroke depression. We did not examine this specific comparison in our review. However, when review authors in <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK> compared acupuncture plus medication versus medication alone or acupuncture monotherapy versus medication alone, they found no benefit for individuals with major depressive disorder in comparisons with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. Our review includes 11 studies that became available after publication of <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK> and provides updated evidence.</P><P>Our findings are very similar to those of the most recent review - <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2015</LINK> - which included a meta-analysis of trials comparing acupuncture plus medication versus medication alone. This meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture combined with SSRI medication was superior to SSRI medication alone.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-26 10:39:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 10:38:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The 64 trials included in this review compared acupuncture alone or in combination with pharmaceutical therapy versus a range of comparator interventions. The reduction in severity of depression at the end of treatment was smaller when acupuncture was compared with control acupuncture than when acupuncture was compared with no treatment control, although we rated both sets of results as providing low-quality evidence. The possible benefit of acupuncture provided alone or in conjunction with pharmaceutical medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) compared with pharmaceutical monotherapy is uncertain owing to the very low quality of available evidence. The effect of acupuncture compared with psychological therapy is unclear. The risk of adverse events with acupuncture is also unclear, as most trials did not report these adequately. However, in general, the risk of adverse events associated with acupuncture is low (<LINK REF="REF-Melchart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Witt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2009</LINK>). Few trials reported on dropout, reduced use of medication, and quality of life. Evidence is insufficient to show the optimal type of acupuncture or characteristics of acupuncture dosage. Lack of medium-term and long-term follow-up in clinical trials represents a significant limitation of the evidence base.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-26 10:39:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Further randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of individuals with depression. All future randomised trials should consider other outcome measures such as adverse event reporting and changes in quality of life, in addition to clinical outcomes. Greater attention should be given to methodological design, including randomisation and blinding of practitioners (when appropriate), outcome assessors, and analysts. Using a combination of patient-reported scales and blinded clinician-reported scales may help to ameliorate some of the issues associated with lack of participant blinding. Future trials must be adequately powered and conducted in an appropriate setting, and must provide comprehensive adverse event reporting and medium- and long-term follow-up (for at least a year) if they are to provide outcome data that will increase the level of quality of the evidence base. Researchers must examine the effects of acupuncture treatment dosage on clinical outcomes as well as the efficacy and effectiveness of other modes of stimulation, including laser acupuncture.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-01 10:08:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>The review authors would like to acknowledge the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders team for assistance with preparation of the original review and its update, including the Trials Search Co-ordinator for assistance in developing the search strategy; as well as editors, co-editors, and other staff within the team.

This decision reflects a change from the original protocol. The statement that data on at least one primary outcome must be reported for inclusion has been removed because outcome measures do not serve as the basis for inclusion.</P><P>In updating this review, we made the following changes to the protocol: (1) excluded quasi-randomised controlled trials owing to the large number of randomised trials now published; (2) performed an a posteriori subgroup analysis to examine the effect of the number of treatment sessions undertaken (&lt; 20 sessions vs &#8805; 20 sessions); (3) added a new comparison of acupuncture plus medication versus medication alone to bring this update in line with others from the CCMD Group; (4) reported individual quality of life domains in the absence of an overall score; (5) if data were not reported in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis, provided a narrative report of the findings; (6) performed an a posteriori sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of overall risk of bias; and (7) planned to perform an a posteriori subgroup analysis to examine effects of using self-reported versus clinician-rated scales. We could not undertake this analysis owing to the small number of included studies. We instead explored the impact of this factor on each outcome when we encountered a mixture of self-reported and clinician-rated depression outcomes.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES/></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-03-02 13:10:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon">

For DCEAS, the following 6 matches of forehead acupoints innervated by the trigeminal nerve via inserted or non-inserted needles were used: Baihui (Du-20) and Yintang (EXHN3), left Sishencong (EX-HN1) and Toulinqi (GB15), right Sishencong (EX-HN1) and Toulinqi (GB15), bilateral Shuaigu (GB8), bilateralTaiyang (EX-HN5), and bilateral Touwei (ST8). Electrical stimulation was delivered to the 6 points. Electrical stimulation with continuous waves at 2 Hz and constant current and voltage (9 V) was delivered via an acupuncture stimulation instrument (Hwarto, SDZ-II) for 30 minutes (pulse width could not be determined by this model instrument). Selection of this stimulation mode was based on the fact that low frequency could exert broader effects on central neurochemical systems compared with high frequency; this mode has been widely introduced into treatment for those with neuropsychiatric disorders. The intensity of stimulation was adjusted to a level at which participants felt most comfortable.</P><P><B>(2)</B></P><P><B>Duration: </B>3 weeks (9 sessions)</P><P><B>Frequency of treatment: </B>3/week</P><P><B>Treatment protocol: </B></P><P>Non-invasive electro-acupuncture (n-EA) control procedure with Streitberger&#8217;s non-invasive needle was used.

Electrical stimulation was delivered based on the same parameters as were used in DCEAS.

However, we were unable to confirm through correspondence with the trial author whether this was a randomised controlled trial.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Wang-2006"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Participants were quasi-randomised via case number.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Wu-2010"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Clinical diagnosis of depression not made</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Xie-2009"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Inability to establish method of randomisation despite efforts to contact trial author</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Xie-2012"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:07:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The intervention did not meet inclusion criteria because acupuncture and blood letting were combined.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Yeung-2011"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This was a non-randomised observational study.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Zhang-2004"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The intervention did not meet inclusion criteria because acupuncture and control acupuncture were combined.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Zhang-2004b"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This was a non-randomised study.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Zhao-2014"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:08:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Participants were quasi-randomised - allocated by case number.</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:10:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Zhou-2007"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2018-02-25 19:10:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Participants had depression associated with menopause.

Other non-random approaches happen much less frequently than the systematic approaches mentioned above and tend to be obvious. They usually involve judgement or some method of non-random categorisation of participants, for example:</P><UL><LI>allocation by judgement of the clinician;</LI><LI>allocation by preference of the participant;</LI><LI>allocation based on the results of a laboratory or a series of tests; and</LI><LI>allocation by availability of the intervention.</LI></UL><P><I>Criteria for a judgement of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)</I></P><P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit a judgement of 'Yes' or 'No'</P><P><B>ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT</B></P><P><B>Was allocation adequately concealed?
