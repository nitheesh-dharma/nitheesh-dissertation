<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease occurring frequently in young women. It is caused by bacteria multiplying in urine, and the patient usually complains of urgency and burning pain while urinating. The present practice is to treat the patient with antibiotics for three days. In this review we included all studies that compared three-day therapy with longer treatment (five days or more). Three days of treatment were adequate to achieve symptomatic relief for most patients, but it appears that longer therapy is better in terms of bacteria elimination from the urine, no matter what antibiotic is used. Longer therapy for UTI is related to higher rate of adverse reactions to the antibiotics used. Pending further research, it could be considered for women in whom eradication of bacteria in the urine is important.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:08:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5-10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5-10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5-10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5-10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5-10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-29 14:16:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In one cohort study the incidence of the disease was estimated to be 0.5-0.7/person-year (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1996</LINK>). All over the world the most common pathogens of uncomplicated UTI are similar: 80-90% <I>Escherichia coli</I>, 5-10% <I>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</I>, the remaining infections being caused by <I>Proteus</I> spp., and other Gram-negative rods. Most are bacteria from the gut that colonize the perineum and then ascend through the urethra to infect the bladder mucosa. The infection causes specific symptoms, mainly the triad of dysuria (painful urination), urgency (the urgent need to void) and frequency (very frequent urination). In randomised controlled trials (RCTs) the diagnosis is based on positive urine cultures in symptomatic subjects. In the past, the threshold for diagnosis of UTI was &gt;10<SUP>5</SUP> colony forming units (CFU)/mL of voided midstream urine (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1982</LINK>). However two decades ago studies have shown that in young symptomatic women with leucocyturia even 100 CFU/mL voided midstream urine can establish the diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunin 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large range of antimicrobials with different rates of cure and side effects are used in the treatment of UTI. It is thought that a short-course therapy consisting of a three-day antibacterial regimen is sufficient for uncomplicated urinary tract infection, as it is probably as effective as 7-10 days therapy, and may be associated with less side effects and lower costs (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1997</LINK>). Single dose therapy has been advocated for years but about a decade ago reviews have raised doubts as to its use because of a higher frequency of bacteriological recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Leibovici-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovici 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norrby-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norrby 1990</LINK>), and it is no longer common clinical practice. On the other hand, single-dose treatment probably achieves symptomatic relief more rapidly than seven days of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Arav_x002d_Boger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arav-Boger 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most clinical trials assessing effectiveness of therapy, cure was defined as bacteriological cure, rather than symptomatic relief. Uncomplicated UTI is not considered a serious disease. It is not clear whether untreated UTI can progress to pyelonephritis, and if so how often. Progression to pyelonephritis probably occurs at a very low rate, while asymptomatic bacteriuria in young, healthy and non-pregnant women is not associated with renal damage (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus since our last systematic review on the length of treatment of uncomplicated UTI in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Leibovici-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovici 1991</LINK>), the following questions arose:</P>
<OL>
<LI>What is the relative effectiveness of three days treatment compared with multi-day treatment?</LI>
<LI>Is any difference modified by the antibiotic used (old versus new) or CFU/mL count?</LI>
<LI>Do persistent positive cultures lead to persistent symptoms?</LI>
<LI>What is the relative effectiveness of single dose and three-day treatment, compared with seven days treatment, when the outcome of interest is symptomatic cure rather than bacteriological one?</LI>
<LI>Does the duration of treatment influence the development of resistant strains during treatment?</LI>
</OL>

<P>Dichotomous data was analysed by calculating the risk ratio (RR) for each trial with the uncertainty in each result being expressed using 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity and publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was initially assessed by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi and I - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We anticipated between-trial variation in estimation of morbidity for those patients who were treated with different antibiotics. Subgroup analyses were performed in order to assess the impact of this possible source of heterogeneity in the main results. The following factors were checked: allocation generation and concealment methods, different antibiotics groups (quinolones, beta-lactams etc), per cent of dropouts in the studies.</P>
<P>A funnel plot estimating the precision of trials (plots of RR for efficacy against the sample size) was examined in order to estimate potential asymmetry. A fixed effect model was used throughout the review, except in the event of significant heterogeneity between the trials (P &lt; 0.10), when the random effect model was chosen.</P>

<P>The included studies were performed between the years 1980-2002 and included 9605 randomised patients. The median number of patients/trial was 300.</P>
<P>In six trials (1356 patients) men were included (<LINK REF="STD-Basista-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Basista 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menday-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Menday 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rapoport-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rapoport 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1987</LINK>). Their number was less than 10% in each study group and it was impossible to separate the results for men and women for any of these trials. One additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bitsch-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bitsch 1985</LINK>) included men, but analysis of men and women was separated and only data regarding women was used for this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Resistant organisms</HEADING>
<P>Only a minority of the included trials described the antibiotic resistance profile of the bacteria cultured from patients urine before and after treatment. In two studies using quinolones in both treatment arms, no persistent or recurrent pathogen developed resistance to the study drugs during treatment or during the follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Internordic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Internordic 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neringer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Neringer 1992</LINK>). In one trial studying thee-day versus seven-day pivmecillinam regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1984</LINK>) the number of resistant bacteria isolates after therapy did not change, and an additional trial using the same drug (<LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1981</LINK>) showed only total rate of resistance development after therapy without specification to different study groups. Two studies using sulfonamide (<LINK REF="STD-Iravani-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Iravani 1983</LINK>) and co-trimoxazole (<LINK REF="STD-Trienekens-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Trienekens 1989</LINK>) mentioned the prevalence of the drug-resistant <I>E. coli</I> in the failure cases, but it was unclear whether these were primary resistant strains or the resistance developed during the treatment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Basista-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Basista 1991</LINK>) showed significant difference in the development of urine bacteria resistance between the three-day (no cases) and the seven-day (three cases) protocols but the drugs used in the two treatment arms were different (quinolone versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), so this data is of only limited value.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 14:33:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-two RCTs, including 9605 patients, comparing three-day antibiotic treatment to 5-10 day treatment for the empirical therapy of uncomplicated UTIs in the young and middle-aged women were analysed. Two outcomes were chosen for comparison: symptomatic failure and bacteriological failure as defined by positive post-treatment urine cultures. Primary treatment failures and recurrences or re-infections were considered together as therapy failures, for in the majority of the studies no distinction could be made between them.</P>
<P>Symptomatic failure rates did not differ significantly both in the short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) or long-term (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.16) after treatment with three-day or 5-10 day regimens. No information about the timing of the symptomatic cure could be found in the included studies.</P>
<P>Five to 10 day antibiotic regimen was more effective than three day therapy, keeping the patients' urine sterile two to 15 days after the end of treatment (same drug therapy RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This means that 41 women would have to be treated for seven days to prevent one case of recurrence or persistence of bacteriuria for a short period. The ITT analysis showed no difference between short and long treatment regimens. Data considering the numbers of randomised patients with positive urine cultures were unattainable from the published articles or any additional source in six major studies in this subgroup (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossius-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gossius 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gossius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trienekens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trienekens 1993</LINK>), so it was impossible to include these trials into the ITT analysis. This fact, together with the high rate of dropouts, could explain why we failed to show a significant effect of therapy duration on the short-term bacteriologic failure rates in the ITT analysis.</P>
<P>A larger advantage of 5-10 day over three-day antibiotic therapy in preventing bacteriological failure was observed after 4 to 10 weeks (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002) when treatment with the same drug was compared (number needed to treat (NNT) = 4). This difference remained significant also with an ITT analysis (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.47, P = 0.003). It is important to mention that the advantage of the longer therapy in terms of bacteriological success appeared to be independent of the antibiotic class chosen for UTI treatment including quinolones.</P>
<P>One reason for the advantage of longer therapy might be the survival of bacteria in subepithelial loci of the lower urinary tract after a shorter course of antibiotic treatment. Recently the ability of <I>E. coli</I> to invade epithelial cells and create biofilms with pod-like bulges on the bladder surface was discovered (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>). These pods contain bacteria encased in a polysaccharide-rich matrix surrounded by a protective shell of uroplakin, and allow bladder infections to persist in the face of robust host defences and short-term antibiotic treatment. Another recently published study showed that asymptomatic bacteriuria is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2000</LINK>). Thus, bacteriological failure might also carry a clinical significance for the patients.</P>
<P>The probable cause for the absence of such difference in the trials comparing different drugs in the two study groups was the fact that all but three of these trials compared three-day quinolone therapy with 5 to 10 day regimen of beta-lactams or sulfonylamides/trimethoprim. Both the higher urine concentration and the lower rate of bacteria drug resistance favoured the newer quinolones. When trying to answer the question concerning the optimal treatment duration for UTI one should probably consider trials comparing the same drug in the two therapy groups.</P>
<P>We found a discrepancy between symptomatic cure, which was not influenced by treatment duration, and bacteriological cure. Fewer included trials showed results of symptomatic cure as compared to bacteriologic results (21 versus 31 studies at the first follow-up and 10 versus 18 at the second follow-up, respectively). This could be one of the reasons explaining the discrepancy between the efficacy results for these two outcomes.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the cost of the higher bacteriological cure rates after longer antibiotic therapy is a significantly higher rate of adverse events, including those leading to treatment discontinuation. Again, the difference was observed in the trials dealing with two regimens of the same drug. The per cent of patients who stopped the treatment because of adverse effects in the three-day group was 1.5% compared to 3.2% in the 5-10 day group (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.98, P = 0.04), number needed to harm = 79. However all adverse effects were minor.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses that did not detect sources of bias originating in studies`design, methodology or class of antibiotic drug used. However, allocation concealment was known to be adequate in only 12 of included 31 trials, and only 11 were blinded. All but two of the included studies did not adhere to the principle of ITT analysis. Larger numbers of patients excluded from the efficacy analysis was due to negative urine cultures after admission, which should be considered as exclusions rather than dropouts, but the high rate of dropouts during the follow-up was a major problem in many included studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The present practice of treating uncomplicated UTIs in young women for only three days to achieve symptomatic relief is probably sufficient for the majority of patients. However it leaves a significant risk of recurrent or persistent bacteriuria independent of the class of the drug.</P>
<P>Pending further research, antibiotic treatment for 5-10 days could be considered for women in whom bacteriological eradication might be of importance: e.g. women suffering from recurrent and painful lower UTIs, planning pregnancy or with underlying disorders. Ultimately the decision regarding therapy duration should be taken with the patient, balancing the higher bacteriological cure rate versus the similar symptomatic outcome and increased risk for adverse events.</P>
<P>The risk of pyelonephritis development as a function of therapy duration is probably irrelevant as it is an extremely rare event in patients with lower UTI.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We propose that future research in this area should address the question of the link between the bacteriuria and symptomatic UTIs. Future trials should use the same antibiotic drug in the different treatment duration groups to exclude the effect of antibiotic efficacy. It is important to perform antibiotic susceptibility tests during the follow-up to assess whether duration of the antibiotic therapy influences the rate of resistance development.<BR/> <BR/>The duration of treatment in special groups of women (i.e. those suffering from recurrent and painful lower UTIs, planning pregnancy, or with underlying disorders) should be addressed in further studies.</P>
