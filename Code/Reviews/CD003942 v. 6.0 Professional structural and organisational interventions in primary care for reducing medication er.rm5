<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out the best way to reduce medication errors by primary healthcare professionals in adult patients that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and death. We wanted to know whether targeting individual health professionals (e.g. with educational materials and reminders about drug dosage etc.), changing the organisation of primary care (e.g. revising professional roles, such as nurse- or pharmacist-led prescribing etc.), or structural actions, such as organising quality monitoring services can reduce medication errors by primary healthcare professionals. We collected and analysed relevant studies to answer this question and found 30 studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
</P>
<P>The 30 studies (169,969 participants) in this Cochrane Review showed that actions aimed at reducing medication errors, such as medication reviews by pharmacists or physicians probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital, number of hospital admissions, number of emergency department visits, or death. In general, all the actions described in the review were found to have unclear benefits. We did not find any studies that fitted the criteria of structural actions. The main limitation of this review is the small number of studies addressing each method and the low-certainty of the evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review? </B>
</P>
<P>Prescribing medications is one of the most powerful tools available to general practitioners (GPs) in the prevention and treatment of disease. Medication-related adverse events could be the result of people either experiencing adverse drug reactions (not usually preventable) or as a result of medication errors (usually preventable). We studied the effectiveness of professional and organisational methods compared to standard care in primary care settings (examples of primary care settings include general practices, community pharmacies, patient homes, community settings, outpatient clinics, and aged-care facilities) to reduce preventable medication errors that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and death in adults who are prescribed medication in primary care.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We included 30 studies in our analysis. We classified 26 studies as organisational and the remaining four as professional actions. We found no structural actions in our search. The studies included in this Cochrane Review showed that based on moderate- and low-certainty evidence, actions in primary care for reducing preventable medication errors probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital or the number of hospitalisations, emergency department visits, or death. Most of the studies took place in the UK and the USA; studies undertaken in high-income countries with disadvantaged populations, and in low- and middle-income countries, were underrepresented. This might affect the generalisation of the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Certainty of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found the overall certainty of evidence for the professional actions to vary considerably across the reported outcomes: moderate-certainty for number of hospital admissions, high-certainty for number of people admitted to hospital, low-certainty for number of emergency department visits, and moderate-certainty for deaths. The certainty of evidence for organisational actions was less varied: very low-certainty for number of hospital admissions, low-certainty for number of people admitted to hospital, and very low-certainty for number of emergency department visits and deaths.</P>
<P>More work needs to be done in improving the quality of the studies regarding selection of participants and adequate blinding of participants and study assessors. Participants dropping out of the studies was another concern in the certainty of evidence. Funding of the included studies came from various sources and it is difficult to decide whether the funding affected the results of the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review? </B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies that had been published up to 4 October 2016.</P>

<P>To determine the effectiveness of professional, organisational and structural interventions compared to standard care to reduce preventable medication errors by primary healthcare professionals that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-02 11:38:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registries on 4 October 2016, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also searched several sources of grey literature.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-09-26 00:01:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised trials in which healthcare professionals provided community-based medical services. We also included interventions in outpatient clinics attached to a hospital where people are seen by healthcare professionals but are not admitted to hospital. We only included interventions that aimed to reduce medication errors leading to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, or mortality. We included all participants, irrespective of age, who were prescribed medication by a primary healthcare professional.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-29 17:57:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="hanan khalil">
<P>Three review authors independently extracted data. Each of the outcomes (hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality), are reported in natural units (i.e. number of participants with an event per total number of participants at follow-up). We presented all outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE tool to assess the certainty of evidence.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-27 09:59:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="hanan khalil">
<P>We included 30 studies (169,969 participants) in the review addressing various interventions to prevent medication errors; four studies addressed professional interventions (8266 participants) and 26 studies described organisational interventions (161,703 participants). We did not find any studies addressing structural interventions. Professional interventions included the use of health information technology to identify people at risk of medication problems, computer-generated care suggested and actioned by a physician, electronic notification systems about dose changes, drug interventions and follow-up, and educational interventions on drug use aimed at physicians to improve drug prescriptions. Organisational interventions included medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician-led clinics, and home visits by clinicians.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of diversity in types of professionals involved and where the studies occurred. However, most (61%) of the interventions were conducted by pharmacists or a combination of pharmacists and medical doctors. The studies took place in many different countries; 65% took place in either the USA or the UK. They all ranged from three months to 4.7 years of follow-up, they all took place in primary care settings such as general practice, outpatients' clinics, patients' homes and aged-care facilities. The participants in the studies were adults taking medications and the interventions were undertaken by healthcare professionals including pharmacists, nurses or physicians. There was also evidence of potential bias in some studies, with only 18 studies reporting adequate concealment of allocation and only 12 studies reporting appropriate protection from contamination, both of which may have influenced the overall effect estimate and the overall pooled estimate.</P>
<P>
<B>Professional interventions</B>
</P>
<P>Professional interventions probably make little or no difference to the number of hospital admissions (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.96; 2 studies, 3889 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Professional interventions make little or no difference to the number of participants admitted to hospital (adjusted RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 1 study, 3661 participants; high-certainty evidence). Professional interventions may make little or no difference to the number of emergency department visits (adjusted RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1067 participants; low-certainty evidence). Professional interventions probably make little or no difference to mortality in the study population (adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17; 1 study, 3538 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Organisational interventions</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce the number of hospital admissions (adjusted RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.03; 11 studies, 6203 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Overall, organisational interventions may make little difference to the total number of people admitted to hospital in favour of the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 13 studies, 152,237 participants; low-certainty evidence. Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce the number of emergency department visits in favour of the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15; 5 studies, 1819 participants; very low-certainty evidence. Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce mortality in favour of the intervention group (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.03; 12 studies, 154,962 participants; very low-certainty evidence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-22 01:23:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on moderate- and low-certainty evidence, interventions in primary care for reducing preventable medication errors probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital or the number of hospitalisations, emergency department visits, or mortality. The variation in heterogeneity in the pooled estimates means that our results should be treated cautiously as the interventions may not have worked consistently across all studies due to differences in how the interventions were provided, background practice, and culture or delivery of the interventions. Larger studies addressing both professional and organisational interventions are needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made. We did not identify any structural interventions and only four studies used professional interventions, and so more work needs to be done with these types of interventions. There is a need for high-quality studies describing the interventions in more detail and testing patient-related outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-26 11:10:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Medication-related (drug-related) adverse events in primary care represent an important cause of hospital admissions and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2003</LINK>). Medication-related adverse events could be the result of people either experiencing adverse drug reactions (not usually preventable) or as a result of medication errors (usually preventable) (<LINK REF="REF-Bates-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2000</LINK>, adverse drug reactions can be defined as "an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product." Medication errors on the other hand, are mostly preventable. A medication error is defined by <LINK REF="REF-Ferner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferner 2006</LINK> as "a failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient." They are mainly due to prescribing or medication management errors. A reduction of these types of prescribing/medication errors has been a high priority for healthcare policy in order to improve the safety profile of the healthcare delivery system (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soe-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soe 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>A prospective cohort study has shown that within four weeks of receiving a primary care prescription, 25% of participants experienced an adverse drug event, 11% of which were judged preventable (<LINK REF="REF-Gandhi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandhi 2003</LINK>). A systematic review and meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Winterstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winterstein 2002</LINK> reported that a median 7.1% (inter-quartile range 5.7% to 16.2%) of hospital admissions resulted from drug-related problems, of which 59% were considered preventable (i.e. attributable to error), while <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2007</LINK> reported that a median of 3.7% of hospital admissions were preventable and drug-related. Improving patient safety is, as a consequence, now a government priority in many high-income and middle- and low-income countries, including the UK, USA and five African countries; Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, Tanzania and Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-22 01:34:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we examined interventions in primary care to reduce preventable medication errors that resulted in hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality. The three main types of interventions that we examined included professional, organisational, and structural interventions as described by Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). Professional interventions included quality assurance tools that provided educational interventions for practitioners or participants, such as teaching the use of structured assessments with general practitioners (GPs). Organisational interventions included revision of professional roles (e.g. nurse- or pharmacist-led chronic disease clinics and nurse prescribing) and revision of clinical multidisciplinary teams (e.g. pharmacist-managed medication reviews). Structural interventions included the organisation of quality monitoring services. We used these interventions for any type of primary care-based population, irrespective of their characteristics. The comparator was no intervention or standard or usual care. The selected outcomes included in the review were the number of hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality. These outcomes were selected as they are tangible and mostly reported in primary studies. We did not consider patient-oriented or patient-mediated outcomes in this review due to the complexity of the included interventions. We will consider these outcomes in the updated review.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-26 11:13:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The three main interventions, mentioned above, used different approaches to achieve a reduction in medication errors that led to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality.</P>
<P>Professional interventions included continuing education and quality assurance that provided educational interventions for practitioners or participants, such as teaching the use of structured assessments with GPs. Other examples of professional interventions included drug education programmes for physicians that were run by physicians, electronic health record systems that provided information about drugs and gave recommendations about changing doses, health technology that identified care home residents at risk of falls, and computer-based drug-ordering systems that gave suggestions to physicians and pharmacists.</P>
<P>Organisational interventions included revision of professional roles (e.g. nurse- or pharmacist-led chronic disease clinics and nurse prescribing) and revision of clinical multidisciplinary teams (e.g. pharmacist-managed medication reviews). Organisational interventions may have included telephone consultations along with home-based medication reviews by pharmacists or nurses. Such interventions aimed at engaging workers in the management of risk to increase patient safety.</P>
<P>Structural interventions included the organisation of quality monitoring services. Examples of these interventions included structural approaches such as social, economic, and political interventions that could improve public health outcomes by increasing the willingness and ability of individuals to practice prevention. An example of the latter would be the introduction of financial incentives to healthcare workers to reduce medication errors. By looking at all of these interventions in the current review, we can begin to address the multiple perspectives of various stakeholders who provide health care to individuals in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Benning-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benning 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-22 01:40:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prescribing medications is one of the most powerful tools available to GPs in the prevention and treatment of disease, and alleviation of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2014</LINK>). However, medication-related adverse events arising as a result of primary care prescribing are an important source of participant morbidity, much of which could be prevented by higher-quality prescribing and medicines management (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2007</LINK>). To date, there is little information on the interventions mentioned above, aimed at reducing preventable medication-related adverse events in primary care due to errors. A review undertaken by 
<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>, addressed interventions of all types of medical errors in both primary and secondary care. It highlighted the complexity in studying those types of interventions aimed at minimising errors in healthcare delivery. Other reviews by 
<LINK REF="REF-Durieux-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durieux 2012</LINK> and 
<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2008</LINK> focused on interventions to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes, including prescribing. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Royal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal 2006</LINK> found that there was weak evidence to support pharmacist-led medication interventions being effective in reducing hospital admissions. However, none of these reviews have focused on other types of interventions at the professional, organisational or structural level that could possibly reduce medication errors in the primary care setting.</P>
<P>Given that preventable medication errors in primary care are associated with hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality, it is important to know whether there are any interventions that have been found to be effective in reducing the occurrence of these outcomes. While members of our team published a related systematic review on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal 2006</LINK>), there has been no Cochrane Review of interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of preventable medication errors that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality.</P>

<P>We included randomised trials in this review. We excluded controlled before-after studies and other non-randomised designs as they provided much weaker evidence due to the non-randomisation of participants to experimental and control groups. We did not impose any restriction on the language or country in which studies were carried out.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-09-26 11:14:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We included studies directed at healthcare professionals and organisations involved in the provision of primary care in the community setting who were authorised to prescribe, sell or administer medications, including primary care physicians (general practitioners (GPs), family doctors, family physicians, family practitioners), dental practitioners, community nurses, nurse practitioners, community pharmacists, dispensers in community pharmacies and any other relevant healthcare providers. We included all adult participants who were receiving a medication through the intervention of the aforementioned primary healthcare professionals.</P>
<P>Examples of community settings included general practice, community pharmacies, and nursing and residential homes. We excluded studies of interventions for outpatients in a clinic attached to a hospital or a day hospital unless these were specifically described as primary care clinics.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-26 11:14:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Using the taxonomy of interventions developed by EPOC, we categorised interventions that improved patient safety by reducing hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). We compared the interventions with inactive control interventions such as no treatment, or standard or conventional care. We divided interventions into the following categories.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Professional interventions</HEADING>
<P>Professional interventions included the use of health information technology to identify people at risk of medication problems, computer-generated care suggested and actioned by a physician, electronic notification systems about dose changes, drug interventions and follow-up, and educational interventions on drug use aimed at physicians to improve drug prescriptions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Organisational interventions</HEADING>
<P>Examples of organisational interventions included medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician-led clinics, and home visits by clinicians.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Structural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Structural interventions included the organisation of quality monitoring services. Structural approaches included social, economic, and political interventions that could improve public health outcomes by increasing the willingness and ability of individuals to practice prevention. An example of the latter would be the introduction of financial incentives to healthcare workers to reduce medication errors.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-06-22 12:58:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>For each of the primary outcomes listed above, we reported outcomes for each study in natural units (i.e. number of participants with an event per total number of participants at follow-up). We examined funnel plots for evidence of publication bias and analysed data using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>).

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-09-22 02:11:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We examined the methods of analysis of all study types critically. All randomised trials were appropriately analysed.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-26 11:32:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Because trials may not have been carried out according to a common protocol, there were usually variations in participant groups, clinical settings, concomitant care, etc. Therefore, we assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We considered trial data to be heterogeneous where the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was greater than 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>). We used a random-effects meta-analysis for combining data due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. We grouped studies based on the two main interventions (i.e. professional and organisational). Where appropriate, we carried out meta-analyses to establish the effects of interventions on medication-related hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality. We found no studies addressing structural interventions and hence no analysis was undertaken.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings table' and GRADE</HEADING>
<P>We included two 'Summary of findings' tables for the main intervention comparisons: 'professional interventions compared to usual care' (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); and 'organisational interventions compared to usual care' (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables include the justification for our decisions to downgrade or upgrade the evidence for an outcome, along with comments to help the reader understand the process. We included the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables: number of hospital admissions, number of people admitted to hospital, number of emergency department visits, and mortality.</P>
<P>Three review authors (HK, HC and BB) used the GRADE tool to independently judge the certainty of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) with respect to five criteria (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias), with disagreements resolved through discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants and study setting</HEADING>
<P>There is a great deal of diversity in types of professionals involved and where the studies occurred.

<P>The '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables provide a summary of the interventions and comparisons. The interventions varied. Professional interventions included the use of health information technology to identify people at risk of medication problems: computer-generated care suggested and actioned by physicians; electronic notification system about dose changes, drug interventions and follow-up; and educational interventions on drug use aimed at physicians to improve drug prescriptions. Organisational interventions included medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician-led clinics and home visits by clinicians.</P>

Other biases included inappropriate administration of the intervention, such as the method of training used to deliver the intervention or level of knowledge of the health professional delivering the intervention. Short length of the intervention was a bias in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaczorowski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kaczorowski 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Triller-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Triller 2007</LINK>), with the level of knowledge of the pharmacist or health professional delivering the intervention a bias in other studies. For example, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lenaghan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lenaghan 2007</LINK>, research was carried out in one rural general practice with a single experienced review pharmacist, which may have had a bearing on the generalisability of the results.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bernsten-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bernsten 2001</LINK>, one aspect of the study that was not rigorously controlled was the training of participating pharmacists. A study manual was provided to each participating pharmacist, followed by a one-day training session. Further training was provided in individual countries; however, the extent of this was driven by available resources. Other biases include small sample sizes in the intervention arms; with 48 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK> and 77 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Triller-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Triller 2007</LINK>, and poor pharmacist-prescriber communication, which may have reduced the efficacy of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Triller-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Triller 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2001</LINK> did not report on any pre-intervention data for most of the outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Gollarte-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Gollarte 2014</LINK> had a short intervention of a six-month period and a short follow-up of three months. <LINK REF="STD-Frankenthal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Frankenthal 2014</LINK> conducted the study in only one geriatric centre.</P>
<P>There was a total of eight cluster-randomised studies included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coleman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coleman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gernant-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gernant 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaczorowski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kaczorowski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lapane-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lapane 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowrie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lowrie 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malet_x002d_Larrea-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Malet-Larrea 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>).

<P>Eleven trials (6203 participants) reported on the number of hospital admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Coleman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coleman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibrahim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ibrahim 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenaghan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lenaghan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowrie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lowrie 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nabagiez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nabagiez 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rytter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rytter 2010</LINK>). The organisational interventions included medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician-led clinics, and home visits by clinicians. Most interventions included optimisation of the medications that participants were taking or home visits by healthcare practitioners, or both. Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions (which included pharmaceutical care or medication reviews by a doctor, a pharmacist, or a nurse, home visits, educational interventions with a pharmacist) reduce the number of hospital admissions (adjusted RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.03; very low-certainty evidence. There was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 75%, P &lt; 0.0001) across the studies (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The direction of the effect was consistent in 10 out of 11 trials. <LINK REF="STD-Holland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2005</LINK> reported an increase in the total number of hospital admissions (adjusted RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.50; based on very low-certainty evidence. The study authors explained these findings by indicating that their study was not statistically powered to detect changes in hospital admissions and new admissions. The study authors explained the unusual increase in hospital admissions among participants by concluding that the participants were better informed about adverse events through the pharmacist intervention, and this promoted help-seeking behaviour, which resulted in an admission.</P>
<P>We undertook a sensitivity analysis by removing studies at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nabagiez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nabagiez 2013</LINK>), and again it is uncertain whether organisational interventions (which included pharmacist home visits, pharmaceutical care plan, home-based nurse care and home visits by physician assistants) reduce the number of hospital admissions (adjusted RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03). <LINK REF="STD-Ibrahim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ibrahim 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rytter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rytter 2010</LINK> showed a reduction in hospital admissions with a relatively narrow confidence interval: adjusted RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74 (<LINK REF="STD-Ibrahim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ibrahim 2013</LINK>); RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72 (<LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK>); and RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95 (<LINK REF="STD-Rytter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rytter 2010</LINK>), in favour of the interventions. These three studies were characterised by frequent follow-up by the clinical pharmacists. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Ibrahim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ibrahim 2013</LINK>, there was a three-month follow-up and a once-a-week telephone conversation; <LINK REF="STD-Moertl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moertl 2009</LINK> had frequent follow-up by the clinical pharmacists at three, six, nine, and 12 months; and <LINK REF="STD-Rytter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rytter 2010</LINK> also had three follow-up contacts by GPs and district nurses.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-22 19:09:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this Cochrane Review showed that, based on moderate- and low-certainty evidence, interventions in primary care for reducing preventable medication errors probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital or the number of hospitalisations, emergency department visits, or mortality. Most of the interventions took place in the UK and the USA; studies undertaken in high-income countries with disadvantaged populations, and in low- and middle-income countries, were underrepresented. This might affect the generalisability of the results. We undertook sensitivity analysis by removing studies at high risk of bias and detecting whether there was any difference on the overall effect size. Overall, there is no evidence of an effect in any of the outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-27 15:05:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The types of interventions included in this review were based on the taxonomy of interventions developed by Cochrane EPOC (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>); four studies used professional interventions and 26 studies used organisational interventions. The professional interventions included the use of health information technology to identify people at risk of medication problems: computer-generated care suggested and actioned by a physician; electronic notification systems about dose changes, drug interventions and follow-up; and educational interventions on drug use aimed at physicians to improve drug prescriptions. Organisational interventions consisted of medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician-led clinics and home visits by clinicians.</P>
<P>The interventions described in the review were complex and generally multifaceted, which resulted in significant heterogeneity. The variation in heterogeneity in the pooled estimates means that our results should be treated cautiously as the interventions may not have worked consistently across all studies due to differences in how the interventions were provided, background practice, setting, healthcare system, or delivery of the interventions. Another potential limitation is the quality of the studies. The methods sections of the studies provided varying levels of detail on how complex interventions were developed, the design of the trials or how staff were trained to deliver the interventions. There was also evidence of potential bias in some studies, with only 18 studies reporting adequate concealment of allocation and only 12 studies reporting appropriate protection from contamination, both of which may have influenced the overall effect estimate and the overall pooled estimate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The certainty of the evidence obtained from the 'Summary of findings' tables using the GRADE system highlights the very low to high certainty of the evidence reported by the studies. The primary outcomes of number of hospital admissions and number of people admitted to hospital were reported to have very low- to high-certainty evidence, respectively. Mortality was reported in 13 studies (1 study involving professional interventions, moderate-certainty evidence; and 12 studies involving organisational interventions, very low-certainty evidence), with the main type of biases being detection and performance bias. We considered studies reporting on emergency department visits to have low-certainty evidence for professional interventions and very low-certainty evidence for organisational interventions using the GRADE system, due to study design and heterogeneity. Further research and better study designs are likely to change the overall estimate reported using these outcomes.</P>
<P>The Methods sections provided few details about study methodology and how complex interventions were delivered. The overall quality of the evidence presented in this review is either at high risk or unclear risk of bias. The main limitations were the heterogeneity between studies, the imprecision in results due to the wide confidence intervals amongst studies, unclear selection bias, performance and detection bias, and attrition bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-09-22 19:34:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of studies that we were able to combine in the meta-analysis was somewhat small due to subclassification of the interventions and because not all studies reported on all the outcomes of interest mentioned in the review. We did not place any language restrictions on the search strategy. The review included one study written in Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2001</LINK>). We were able to pool the data from this study with the help of a Spanish-speaking colleague. Despite the limited number of studies that were included, funnel plots of studies reporting the outcomes of interest showed no apparent publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Another limitation of the review included the definitions of 'pharmaceutical care' and 'pharmaceutical review' described in the studies, which may have led to different interventions. We also did not consider studies where participants were treated in the emergency department of hospitals, although we are aware that at times people could receive treatment in the emergency department without being admitted to hospital. We will consider these types of studies in our updated review. Finally, a sensitivity analysis with a separate comparison of cluster- and individual randomised trials may have yielded different results, and we will consider including this in our updated review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-22 19:36:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Few studies have examined whether the types of interventions that were investigated in this review lead to reductions in hospital admissions, emergency department visits, or mortality. One of the few reviews that studied this problem (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal 2006</LINK>), found that pharmacist-led medication reviews were effective in reducing hospital admissions, although restricting the analysis to randomised trials did not produce a significant benefit.</P>
<P>Previous observational studies addressing similar interventions also provide limited evidence of their effectiveness. A controlled study by <LINK REF="STD-Hugtenburg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hugtenburg 2009</LINK>, which included 37 community pharmacists and 715 participants, and examined the impact of medication reviews and participant counselling at discharge from the hospital by community pharmacists, found that the intervention was not effective at reducing mortality. Another open controlled study, conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Leendertse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leendertse 2013</LINK>, examined the effect of reviewing medications in primary care by pharmacists. They found that the intervention did not significantly reduce medication-related hospital admissions. Moreover, a study by <LINK REF="STD-Safran-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1993</LINK> examined the effect of an electronic medical record used by physicians to care for people with HIV on hospitalisation, emergency visits and mortality. The study authors found that the intervention was significant for emergency department visits, but not for mortality or hospitalisations. Our study mirrors these findings in that the interventions investigated in this review had little or no effect on the number of people admitted to hospital, number of hospital admissions, number of emergency department visits, or mortality.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-16 16:22:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The evidence from this review does not fully support the benefits of interventions to reduce medication-related preventable errors with respect to any of the outcomes of interest that were reported in this review. Both professional and organisational interventions had little or no significant effect on the outcomes of interest. Therefore, organisations implementing interventions to improve medication safety in primary care should be aware that the evidence endorsing these interventions is limited, both in number and methodological quality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-03 20:11:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="hanan khalil">
<P>Larger studies addressing both professional and organisational interventions and reporting on the number of people admitted to hospital and emergency department visits are needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made, given that only one study with 3661 participants addressing professional interventions and 13 studies with 8960 participants reported on the number of people admitted to hospital in primary care following organisational interventions. Emergency department visits were only reported by two studies (1067 participants) describing professional interventions and five studies (1819 participants) describing organisational interventions.</P>
<P>Further, large studies exploring which interventions involving healthcare professionals (nurse, physician or pharmacist) are likely to have a beneficial effect in preventing errors in primary care should also be addressed. Furthermore, longer time frames for interventions and a focus on high risk participants/therapies would also help. The quality of the studies needs to be improved as the certainty of the evidence was very low to high. The methods sections of the studies provided varying levels of detail on how complex interventions were developed, the design of the trials, or how staff were trained to deliver the interventions. We did not identify any structural interventions and only four studies used professional interventions, so more work needs to be done with these types of interventions. Most of the studies did not provide details of what constituted 'usual care', so this can also be improved in future studies.</P>

<P>6 months professional intervention</P>
<P>A nursing home physician, expert in drug use in older people, delivered a structured educational intervention.</P>
<P>The programme included: general aspects of prescription and drug use in geriatric patients, how to reduce the number of drugs, to perform a regular review of medications, to avoid inappropriate drug use, to discontinue drugs that do not show benefits, and to avoid under-treatment with drugs that have shown benefits.

<P>Organisational.</P>
<P>Participants in the intervention group were scheduled for a care transitions clinic visit with a clinical pharmacist approximately 72 h post discharge, and prior to the post-hospitalisation, primary care-provider visit. The visit involved performing a complete medication history, identifying and resolving medication discrepancies, creating a current medication list for both the medical record and the participant, and counselling on appropriate medication use. During these visits, the pharmacist identified discrepancies between the best possible medication discharge list and the discharge summary, and characterised medication discrepancies using predefined categories. </P>
<P>Study participants in the usual care group were scheduled to see their primary care provider for a post-hospitalisation visit with no interim pharmacist intervention. Medication discrepancies of study participants not attending care transitions visits were identified and characterised by study personnel in the same manner as those in the intervention group. </P>
<P>Study personnel reviewed study participants&#8217; medical records to quantify 30-day ED visits and rehospitalisation at the study institution. All study participants received a phone call approximately 30 days after discharge to report hospitalisations or ED visits at outside institutions. Only hospitalisations and ED visits at the study institution were included for those participants who were not able to be contacted after 3 phone call attempts.</P>
<P>Both the intervention and control group received clinical pharmacy services for the family medicine inpatient service and outpatient family medicine clinic. Inpatient clinical pharmacists conducted rounds with the medical team daily, reviewed and monitored medications for effectiveness and safety, and made recommendations to the physician staff to optimise medications. Participants in both groups received this usual care from the inpatient pharmacist. The role of the inpatient pharmacist in the study was to collaborate with the inpatient medical team to create a BPMDL for all study participants just prior to discharge. The BPMDL was used to identify medication discrepancies, and it served as the gold standard list of medications that the participant should take after discharge.

<P>Initial referral to a review pharmacist included a copy of the participant's discharge letter. Pharmacists arranged home visits at times when they could meet participants and carers. Pharmacists assessed participants' ability to self-medicate and drug adherence, and they completed a standardised visit form. Where appropriate, they educated the participant and carer, removed out of date drugs, reported possible drug reactions or interactions to the general practitioner, and reported the need for a compliance aid to the local pharmacist. Where a compliance aid was recommended, this was provided within the trial and a filling fee was paid to the local pharmacist. 1 follow-up visit occurred at 6-8 weeks after recruitment to reinforce the original advice. </P>

<P>Intervention group: participants assigned to the intervention group received usual care plus pharmacist intervention.</P>
<P>The intervention was provided to every participant in the intervention group and consisted of a 30-min educational session during the clinic appointment. The pharmacist intervention focused on participants improving self-care, recognising symptoms of fluid retention, measuring weight daily and self-adjusting diuretic dose using a flexible frusemide dose-adjustment regimen, and improving knowledge and understanding of heart failure and heart failure medications.</P>
<P>Usual care (control group): usual care was provided to all of the eligible participants by a cardiologist, heart failure nurse co-ordinators and a dietitian during the clinic appointment. Usual care consisted of assessment of clinical status and medications, education on daily weight measurement, diet, fluid and sodium management, and recognition of signs and symptoms of fluid retention and dehydration. In case of a sudden increase in weight of more than 1 kg/d for 2 d, participants were encouraged to contact the heart failure nurse co-ordinators for advice in consultation with the cardiologist to self-adjust their frusemide dose. The heart failure nurse co-ordinators followed up participants 48 h after a dose adjustment to assess if their weight had decreased and condition improved.</P>

<P>IIntervention group: pharmacists allocated to the intervention group provided the medication with follow-up service according to national guidelines. The medication review with follow-up service started with a comprehensive interview undertaken in a private area of the pharmacy. The pharmacist collected relevant information about the participant&#8217;s health problems, medicines used, clinical and biological parameters (gathered through medical records provided by the participant or measured in the pharmacy), medication use, lifestyle habits and concerns about diseases and medications. Pharmacists also assessed the level of control of health problems by using information referred by participants&#8217; and/or clinical and biological parameters, depending on the type of health problem (i.e. pain versus hyperlipidaemia) and classified every health problem as controlled, uncontrolled or unknown. After performing a comprehensive medication review, the pharmacist identified negative clinical outcomes related to medicines and drug-related problems. Subsequently, an action plan was agreed upon by the participant and the physician if required. This medication review with follow-up service was focused on both participants&#8217; outcomes and medication use process and required a commitment to follow-up.</P>

<P>Physician intervention</P>
<P>The computer-based ordering system generated care suggestions for both intervention and control groups; however, the suggestions were displayed by the computer to physicians and/or pharmacists for participants randomised to the appropriate intervention groups. This allowed the researchers to assess the numbers and types of interventions that the control group was eligible to receive as well as those in the 3 intervention groups. For participants in the physician intervention group, all care suggestions based solely on earlier Regenstrief medical records system data were generated at the time that the encounter form was printed and were displayed at the end of the drug list. All hypertension care suggestions for intervention participants were displayed as &#8220;suggested orders&#8221; on physicians&#8217; workstations when they wrote orders after participant visits. This computer screen displayed the actual suggested order, possible actions for each order (order or omit), and a brief explanation of the rationale for the order. Physicians could list full guidelines and literature citations associated with the specific suggestions by using the workstation&#8217;s 'help' key.</P>
<P>Pharmacist Intervention</P>
<P>When any participant brought a new or refill prescription (written in any affiliated clinic, physician&#8217;s office, or Wishard Hospital emergency department) to the Wishard outpatient pharmacy, a pharmacy technician entered the data into the Regenstrief medical records system pharmacy module. This was required for all prescriptions because it was the only way to generate and complete a financial transaction for prescriptions in the outpatient pharmacy. After entering prescription data, a high-speed printer created a label to affix to the participant&#8217;s drug container. The technician who filled the prescription notified the pharmacist for all intervention participants. The labelled drug product was checked by a pharmacist who dispensed the agent to the participant and provided counselling. For this study the researchers created the pharmacist intervention recording system. This software programme was used by all Wishard pharmacists to document all pharmaceutical care interventions provided to any outpatient. For participants enrolled in this study only (regardless of study group), care suggestions generated by the Regenstrief medical records system or the outpatient workstations (in response to data entered by the physician, e.g. new antihypertensive prescriptions) were stored in the pharmacist intervention recording system. For participants randomised to receive care from an intervention pharmacist who had such care suggestions, the high-speed printer printed a note together with drug container labels directing the pharmacist to the pharmacist intervention recording system to display care suggestions that were identical to those viewed by intervention physicians.</P>

<P>Intervention group: effects of pharmaceutical care, consisting of 1-1, in-depth drug therapy reviews conducted by a clinical pharmacist, versus </P>
<P>Control group: standard care, consisting of brief drug therapy reviews conducted by a nurse on several participant outcomes in ambulatory participants undergoing haemodialysis.</P>
<P>Participants assigned to pharmaceutical care had drug therapy reviews conducted by a nephrology-trained clinical pharmacist or 1 of 2 pharmacists completing postdoctoral training in nephrology pharmacotherapy. Types of drug-related problems were recorded and evaluated by using a previously described method. All drug-related problems were assigned to 10 possible categories: untreated indications, improper drug selection, sub therapeutic dosage, overdose, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, failure to receive drugs, medical record discrepancy, inadequate education of participant or health care professional, and drug use without indication. The drug-related problems were further categorised into therapeutic drug classes, and the outcome related to the drug-related problem intervention was captured.</P>
<P>The standard care group served as the control group. The participants in the standard care group received periodic drug profile updates by dialysis nursing staff as mandated by the dialysis clinic policy and procedure. These are typically brief interactions in which participants are queried as to whether any drugs have changed since the last review.</P>

<P>The 12-month intervention involved 3 phases: introducing a new professional role to stakeholders with relationship building, nurse education, and medication review by pharmacists who had a postgraduate diploma in clinical pharmacy.</P>
<P>The clinical pharmacy service model introduced to each nursing home was supported with activities such as focus groups facilitated by a research nurse, written and telephone communication, and face-to-face professional contact between nursing home staff and clinical pharmacists on issues such as drug policy and specific resident problems, together with education and medication review. This was a multifaceted intervention directly targeting nursing homes. Most of the contact with GPs was indirect using the existing relationships between nursing homes and visiting GPs. A number of focus groups and personal interviews about the project were conducted with GPs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Professional interventions</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Distribution of educational materials (distribution of published or printed recommendations for clinical care, including clinical practice guidelines, audiovisual materials and electronic publications; the materials may have been delivered personally or through mass mailings).</LI>
<LI>Educational meetings (healthcare providers who have participated in conferences, lectures, workshops or traineeships)</LI>
<LI>Local consensus processes (inclusion of participating providers in discussion to ensure that they agreed that the chosen clinical problem was important and the approach to managing the problem was appropriate).</LI>
<LI>Educational outreach visits (use of a trained person who met with providers in their practice settings to give information with the intent of changing the provider's practice. The information given may have included feedback on the performance of the providers).</LI>
<LI>Local opinion leaders (use of providers nominated by their colleagues as 'educationally influential'. The investigators must have explicitly stated that their colleagues identified the opinion leaders).</LI>
<LI>Patient-mediated interventions (new clinical information (not previously available) collected directly from patients and given to the provider e.g. depression scores from an instrument).</LI>
<LI>Audit and feedback (any summary of clinical performance of health care over a specified period of time. The summary may also have included recommendations for clinical action. The information may have been obtained from medical records, computerised databases, or observations from patients).</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">The following interventions are excluded</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Provision of new clinical information not directly reflecting provider performance which was collected from patients, e.g. scores on a depression instrument, abnormal test results. These interventions should be described as patient-mediated.</LI>
<LI>Feedback of individual patients' health record information in an alternate format (e.g. computerised). These interventions should be described as organisational.</LI>
<LI>Reminders (patient- or encounter-specific information, provided verbally, on paper or on a computer screen, which is designed or intended to prompt a health professional to recall information. This would usually be encountered through their general education; in the medical records or through interactions with peers, and so remind them to perform or avoid some action to aid individual patient care. Computer-aided decision support and drugs dosage are included).</LI>
<LI>Marketing (use of personal interviewing, group discussion ('focus groups'), or a survey of targeted providers to identify barriers to change and subsequent design of an intervention that addresses identified barriers)</LI>
<LI>Mass media (i. varied use of communication that reached great numbers of people including television, radio, newspapers, posters, leaflets, and booklets, alone or in conjunction with other interventions; ii. targeted at the population level)</LI>
<LI>Other (other categories to be agreed in consultation with the EPOC editorial team)</LI>

<LI>Other (other categories to be agreed in consultation with the EPOC editorial team)</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Premium (patient payment for health insurance. It is important to determine if the patient paid the entire premium, or if the patient&#8217;s employer paid some of it. This includes different types of insurance plans).</LI>
<LI>Co-payment (patient payment at the time of healthcare delivery in addition to health insurance, e.g. in many insurance plans that cover prescription medications, the patient may pay AUD 5 per prescription, with the rest covered by insurance).</LI>
<LI>User fee (patient payment at the time of healthcare delivery)</LI>

<LI>Revision of professional roles (also known as 'professional substitution', 'boundary encroachment' and includes the shifting of roles among health professionals. For example, nurse midwives providing obstetrical care; pharmacists providing drug counselling that was formerly provided by nurses and physicians; nutritionists providing nursing care; physical therapists providing nursing care. Also includes expansion of role to include new tasks).</LI>
<LI>Clinical multidisciplinary teams (creation of a new team of health professionals of different disciplines or additions of new members to the team who work together to care for patients)</LI>
<LI>Formal integration of services (bringing together of services across sectors or teams or the organisation of services to bring all services together at one time also sometimes called 'seamless care')</LI>
