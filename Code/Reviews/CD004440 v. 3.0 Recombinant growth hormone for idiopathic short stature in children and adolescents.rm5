<P>There is some evidence that recombinant human growth hormone improves short term growth and (near) final adult height in children with idiopathic short stature.</P>
<P>Idiopathic short stature is the term used when children are very short compared with others of their age for unknown or hereditary reasons. They do not have a disease. Recombinant human growth hormone has been used to try to overcome growth failure in these children. It must be injected under the skin six to seven times a week until adult height is reached. Existing evidence suggests that growth hormone can increase short term growth and improve final or near final adult height.<BR/>Ten studies included altogether 741 children and lasted between six months and 6.2 years. Results showed that individuals treated with growth hormone remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Girls treated with growth hormone were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (growth hormone treated group 155.3 cm and control group 147.8 cm); another trial found that children treated with growth hormone were 3.7 cm taller than children in a placebo-treated group. No serious adverse effects were reported in the included studies. Although serious adverse effects (there has been concern that growth hormone would induce new tumours or increase the likelihood of tumour relapse) may be rare, their possibility must also be taken into consideration.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Idiopathic short stature (ISS) refers to children who are very short compared with their peers for unknown or hereditary reasons. Recombinant human growth hormone (GH) has been used to increase growth and final height in children with ISS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of recombinant human GH on short-term growth and final height in children with ISS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS and Current Controlled Trials. Article reference lists were assessed for trials and experts and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with ISS with normal GH secretion. GH had to be administered for a minimum of six months and be compared with placebo or no treatment. A growth or height outcome measure had to be assessed.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome was final height and secondary outcomes included short term growth, health related quality of life and adverse effects. To estimate summary treatment effects, data were pooled, when appropriate using a random effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten RCTs were included. One trial reported near final height in girls and found that girls treated with GH were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (GH group, 155.3 cm ± 6.4; control, 147.8 cm ± 2.6; P = 0.003); another trial which reported adult height standard deviation score found that children treated with GH were 3.7 cm taller than children in a placebo-treated group (95% confidence intervals 0.03 to 1.10; P &lt; 0.04). The other trials reported short term outcomes. Results suggest that short-term height gains can range from none to approximately 0.7 SD over one year. One study reported health related quality of life and showed no significant improvement in GH treated children compared with those in the control group, whilst another found no significant evidence that GH treatment impacts psychological adaptation or self-perception in children with ISS. No serious adverse effects of treatment were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>GH therapy can increase short-term growth and improve (near) final height. Increases in height are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Large, multicentre RCTs are required which should focus on final height and address quality of life and cost issues.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 22:36:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Idiopathic short stature is the term used when children are very short compared with others in their age cohort for unknown or hereditary reasons. By definition, children with ISS do not have a disease.</P>
<P>Idiopathic short stature is commonly defined as height below the third percentile or about two standard deviations (SD) or more below the mean height for a given age, sex and population group. Approximate untreated adult height (in cm) for males with ISS ranges from 157 cm to 170 cm, compared with a mean of 178 cm for normal males (2 SD below the mean being 164 cm); untreated adult height for females with ISS ranges from 137 cm to 156 cm, compared with a mean of 164 cm for normal females (2 SD below the mean being 152 cm) (<LINK REF="REF-Price-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preece-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preece 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of idiopathic short stature</HEADING>
<P>Children with ISS are a heterogeneous group, made up of individuals whose short stature cannot be explained by an underlying pathology and who meet the following minimal criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Ranke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranke 1996</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>normal size for gestational age at birth;</LI>
<LI>normal body proportions;</LI>
<LI>no evidence of endocrine deficiency;</LI>
<LI>no evidence of chronic organic disease, no psychiatric disease or severe emotional disturbance, and normal food intake;</LI>
<LI>the growth velocity throughout the growth process may be slow or normal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Recombinant human growth hormone has been used to increase growth and final height in ISS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence and prevalence of idiopathic short stature</HEADING>
<P>Precise estimates for incidence and prevalence of ISS are difficult to obtain. ISS is not determined by diagnostic criteria as it is not a disease and is generally defined by a combination of factors. Children who may be prescribed growth hormone on the basis of ISS generally meet at least two criteria. First, children must be below the third percentile of height and in addition, they must be growing slowly. It is difficult to estimate how many of the lowest 3% of children in height might actually be prescribed growth hormone. One study evaluated children below the 3rd percentile for height and found that only 5% did not reach an adult height greater than two SD below the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Ranke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranke 1995</LINK>). Another study found that 9% of very short children might be prescribed growth hormone (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelstein 1998</LINK>). Therefore, between 5% and 9% of the shortest 3% of the population could be recommended for growth hormone treatment, which is about 0.2% of the child population.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 22:36:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Recombinant human growth hormone has been available since 1985, shortly after growth hormone from cadaveric human pituitaries was withdrawn from use because of its association with the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (<LINK REF="REF-Taback-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taback 1999</LINK>). Recombinant human growth hormone (somatropin) is produced by recombinant DNA technology and has a sequence identical to that of human growth hormone. Somatropin is available from several manufacturers under different brand names. The advent of recombinant GH has meant that GH is far more available and GH has been widely used to treat various growth disorders including ISS (<LINK REF="REF-Gault-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gault 2001</LINK>), although it is not licensed in the UK for treatment of children with ISS.</P>
<P>The number of children with ISS being treated has not been separated from other unlicensed indications, but it has been estimated that at most approximately 275 children with ISS may be receiving treatment in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Hilken-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilken 2001</LINK>). GH is usually prescribed in association with a paediatric endocrinologist or a general paediatrician with a special interest in endocrinology. Routine follow-up should be performed by a paediatric endocrinologist in partnership with the general paediatrician and/or the general practitioner to assess the response to GH treatment. Treatment dosage will need to be amended as the child grows and at puberty. Consensus Guidelines have been produced by The British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Kirk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirk 2001</LINK>), which state that treatment should only be undertaken in specialist centres that regularly participate in national audit of their clinical activities, any potential benefits and adverse medical effects of therapy should be discussed fully with the parents and the child prior to treatment, and that response to treatment should be carefully monitored and the need for ongoing treatment should be re-evaluated annually.</P>
<P>Growth hormone is prescribed in milligrams (mg) or International Units (IU) according to body weight or body surface area and is self administered (or given by the parent) at home usually as a subcutaneous injection generally six to seven times per week. To more closely approximate the natural fluctuations in GH, the injections are usually given at night. In ISS where there is no GH insufficiency, GH is given at supraphysiological levels, levels considerably higher than normal, at 0.33 mg/kg/week (9-10 mg/m²/week). The logic in administering supraphysiological doses is generally that children who have growth deficiencies, but not a hormone deficiency, may have some lack of sensitivity to the hormone (<LINK REF="REF-Kelnar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelnar 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Growth hormone is generally prescribed for a number of years, from recognition of the growth deficit until growth is complete. For an individual child how long this would be will depend upon when the condition is identified. Most trials of GH have been of relatively short duration but in practice in many children therapy could continue for as long as 12 years or more. Expert opinion is that GH therapy should generally not be started before the age of four.</P>
<P>An aspect of considerable interest in the use of hGH in healthy children with ISS is to determine whether treatment with hGH affects children's sense of well-being or quality of life.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Growth hormone therapy is contraindicated in cases of tumour activity and should not be used for growth promotion in adolescents with closed epiphyses. Side effects can include headache, visual problems, nausea and vomiting, fluid retention (peripheral oedema), arthralgia, myalgia, paraesthesia, antibody formation, hypothyroidism and reactions at injection site. There has been concern that growth hormone would induce new tumours or increase the likelihood of tumour relapse. Reports suggest, however, that the risk of new tumours or tumour recurrence is not elevated in children treated with GH who have no other increased risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Blethen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blethen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frisch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frisch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GH-Soc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GH Soc 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures used in assessing effects of growth hormone treatment</HEADING>
<P>Height may be expressed in length units (for example cm) or in standard deviation scores (SDS). The standard deviation is a measure of the variation of observations around the mean. Heights of populations of adults or children generally form normal distributions such that 95.4% of a population will have heights that fall within 2 standard deviations from the mean. Individual observations can be compared with heights corresponding to points on the height distribution for a particular age to determine how a child's (or adult's) height compares with their peers. Standard deviation score is defined by the formula: actual height minus mean height for age divided by standard deviation of height for age. Standard deviation scores using controlled data collected from an appropriate population base allow comparison of measures independent of age or sex. In this system the normal population mean is zero and a normal SD score will lie between -2 and +2 SD. A healthy individual's SDS will not change during the growth years. Increased SDS implies catch-up growth and a decrease implies growth failure.</P>
<P>Height and growth can be considered either in terms of absolute values (for example final height = 160 cm) or in terms of change from a baseline value.</P>
<P>The best measure of how growth hormone affects growth is final height (in cm or SD). Measuring final height requires that the child has finished growing. The most reliable measures of final height use multiple criteria to determine that growth is complete or nearly complete. Generally, it is considered that children have completed or nearly completed their growth, when their growth rate within a year has slowed to less than some specified amount (for example 1-2 cm) and skeletal maturity assessed by radiographs of the wrist and hand indicate that the epiphyses have closed (often expressed as bone age greater than a certain value, for example 14 - 15 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Frindik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frindik 1999</LINK>). 'Near final height' may also be used acknowledging that growth may not be complete.</P>
<P>Although the overall effectiveness of GH in treating short stature is to be found in measures of final height, it has been argued that short-term measures of growth, such as growth velocity, are also of importance. Children and parents may be concerned with whether growth within a certain time frame is comparable to that of a child's peers. Growth velocity may also be a better interim growth measure than height attained at a particular age as it is independent of growth in previous years. Growth velocity is also used to assess the response of children to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Child-Growth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Child Growth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Growth velocity is a measure of the height gained (cm) within a specified time period (usually a year). This outcome is also often referred to as 'height velocity'. Growth velocity can also be considered in relation to a child's age by considering growth velocity relative to the distribution of growth velocities for children of a particular age (growth velocity standard deviation score). As with height, growth velocity SDS measures are dependent upon the reference data used (<LINK REF="REF-Child-Growth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Child Growth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bone age is a measure of skeletal maturity, usually determined by examining the relative positions of the bones in the left hand and wrist from a radiograph. Assessment of bone age is important to evaluate when the epiphyses have closed and growth is complete (growth cannot occur after the epiphyses [ends of the long bones] have closed).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Existing evidence on the use of growth hormone in idiopathic short stature</HEADING>
<P>There is continued controversy over the use of growth hormone in ISS both in terms of how much additional height may be gained from treatment, and the ethics of treating children who do not have a disease (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2006</LINK>). Even with treatment, the final height of children with ISS may still be below the normal range. Also, although it may be of considerable value to increase the height of children who may be much shorter than their peers, there will always be children who make up the lowest percentiles on the height distribution curve.</P>
<P>There is a large volume of literature on the use of GH in ISS, ranging from RCTs to lower quality evidence such as case series. Evidence from high quality studies is to be preferred to reduce risk of biased results and to ensure apparent treatment effects are not artifacts of differences between patient groups.</P>

<P>Assessment of the quality of reporting of each trial was based on the quality criteria specified by Jadad (Jadad 1996). This scale assesses:<BR/>1) Minimisation of selection bias: was the study described as randomised, and was the method to generate randomisation described and appropriate.<BR/>2) Minimisation of detection bias: was the study described as double blind and was the method of blinding described and appropriate; were the outcome assessors blind to the intervention.<BR/>3) Minimisation of attrition bias: were withdrawals and dropouts described and quantified.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (see Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A: All quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B: One or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C: One or more quality criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Results from the published randomised controlled trials suggest that growth hormone (GH) therapy is effective in promoting growth in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) in the short term, and significant changes can be achieved when assessed using height standard deviation scores and growth velocity measures. Studies suggest that short-term height gains can range from none to approximately 0.7 SD over one year. The study that reports adult height SDS suggests a height gain of 0.57 SDS in children treated with GH compared with those given a placebo, which equates to about 3.7 cm. Results from the one RCT reporting near final height found that treated girls were approximately 7.5 cm taller than girls randomised to the control group and 6 cm taller than girls who refused consent. However, these increases are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature, with heights near the lower bound of the normal range (i.e. approximately 2 SD below the normal mean). Growth and final height are dependent, not only upon hormonal factors, but also on the genetic endowment from parents, which should be considered when establishing realistic expectations about the potential effects of GH on final height. Also, it has been shown that growth hormone treatment can result in a high rate of bone maturation and an earlier onset of puberty with the paradoxical effect of shortening the growth period and premature closure of the epiphyses which may not be followed by a gain in final height (<LINK REF="STD-Kamp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamp 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been considered that final height is the best indicator of the effectiveness of GH in promoting growth given the natural variations in growth velocity. However, the available evidence on final height is extremely limited. Only one study that used the best methodology of double-blind placebo control has been conducted to final height but reported outcomes as adult height SDS rather than final height. Therefore, conclusions about the effects of GH on final height are tenuous. Another concern relating to the literature is that the children who are considered in the studies of ISS are quite heterogenous, and therefore generalisations are difficult. Additionally, outcomes other than height are not well represented in the literature. Only one of the studies included in the review considered quality of life issues, and could provide no evidence to support the commonly held assumption that growth hormone treatment improves health related quality of life in children with ISS. Another study concluded that short stature in children with ISS is not associated with problems in psychological adaptation or self-concept.</P>
<P>Another important consideration is whether shortness is an impediment to a healthy childhood. It is important to bear in mind that, although it may be of considerable value to increase the height of children who may be dramatically shorter than their peers, there will always be children who make up the lowest percentiles on the height distribution curve. </P>
<P>The issue of treatment compliance should also be noted. GH treatment generally requires taking injections six to seven times per week for several years. If the treatment regimen is not adhered to closely, effectiveness could be compromised. Compliance is also important because it will have an impact on costs and cost-effects. A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Bryant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryant 2002</LINK>) estimated the incremental cost of GH treatment for one child with ISS to be between £50,000 and £70,000 (34,800 to 48,720 Euros), and the annual cost of GH treatment of a 30-kg child to be between £8,000 and £11,800 (5,570 to 8,210 Euros). The incremental cost of each centimetre in final height gained due to GH treatment was estimated to be between £13,500 and £27,200 (9,400 to 18,930 Euros), but could range from £4,295 to £272,020 (2,990 to 189,325 Euros). Another study (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>) has estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GH therapy compared with no therapy for ISS in prepubertal boys as over $US52,000 (over 40,600 Euros). These issues are of particular importance in ISS and the use of an intervention for children who are not ill.</P>
<P>Very few adverse events were reported in the included studies. However, only a relatively small number of children participated in these studies, and potentially important adverse effects may not be detected in the context of such small trials. Over longer term surveillance and outside the context of randomised controlled trials it seems that adverse effects are rare, but can be serious, such as diabetes mellitus, slipped capital femoral epiphyses and malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-GH-Soc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GH Soc 2001</LINK>). Care should be taken in monitoring for adverse effects, and reporting them in randomised controlled trials. <BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The reported results suggest that growth hormone does improve growth and final height in idiopathic short stature. Although treated individuals may be taller than non-treated individuals, they are still relatively short compared with peers of normal height. Therefore whether the small expected gain in height is substantial enough to merit frequent or daily injections for a number of years in children who do not have a disease is not clear. Additionally, there is no evidence that growth hormone treatment improves health related quality of life or psychological adaptation. The cost of growth hormone is also substantial and it is a matter of debate as to whether the gains in height justify the expense. If large numbers of children with idiopathic short stature were to seek growth hormone treatment, this would have significant cost implications. Finally, although serious adverse effects may be rare, their possibility must also be taken into consideration. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are required that focus on clear outcomes such as final height, rather than outcomes which are poorly predictive surrogate markers (such as predicted adult height or target height). In addition to growth hormone effects on height, research should address adverse effects, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes in children who are treated and focus particularly on measures that can be used in economic modelling. These trials should be analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Other outstanding issues to be addressed in future research include age of onset of treatment, optimal dose of treatment, psychological issues, and heterogeneity of participants in studies (which could be masking a subset of those who could benefit long term). </P>
