<P>Nine RCTs involving 3396 participants met the inclusion criteria.

After pooling the eight studies that compared mupirocin with placebo or with no treatment, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of <I>S. aureus </I>infection associated with intranasal mupirocin (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70).<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-14 10:27:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>(<I>S. aureus)</I> is the leading nosocomial (hospital acquired) pathogen in hospitals throughout the world. Infection with <I>S. aureus </I>is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality - a trend that is increasing due to the widespread dissemination of meticillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I> (MRSA) (<LINK REF="REF-NNIS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNIS 2004</LINK>). MRSA is not more pathogenic (disease-causing) than <I>S. aureus</I>, but therapy is more problematic.</P>
<P>Staphylococcal infections occur regularly in hospitalised patients and can have severe consequences including postoperative wound infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and catheter-related bacteremia (bacteria in the blood that can cause disease, e.g. endocarditis, elsewhere in the body) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplowitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplowitz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluytmans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluytmans 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluytmans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluytmans 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yzerman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yzerman 1996</LINK>). A recent study of over seven million hospital admissions in the US estimated that 0.8% of all patients suffered from infection with <I>S. aureus</I>, corresponding to a total of nearly 300,000 patients in US hospitals in 2003. After controlling for confounders the annual impact in the US was estimated to be 2.7 million additional days in hospital, US$9.5 billion excess costs, and at least 12,000 in-patient deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Noskin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noskin 2005</LINK>). Since the consequences of these infections are immense, effective prevention strategies are essential.</P>
<P>Traditionally, control of <I>S. aureus </I>has been focused on preventing cross-infection between patients (<LINK REF="REF-Pittet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 2000</LINK>), however, it has been shown repeatedly that a large proportion of nosocomial <I>S. aureus </I>infections originate from patients' own flora (non-pathogenic bacteria normally present on the patient) (<LINK REF="REF-Kluytmans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluytmans 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Eiff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Eiff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wertheim-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wertheim 2004a</LINK>). Nasal carriage (presence in the nose) of <I>S. aureus </I>is now considered a well defined risk factor for subsequent infection in various groups of patients, including those on dialysis; with cirrhosis of the liver; undergoing surgery; and with intravascular devices or in intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Kluytmans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluytmans 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three approaches to the elimination of <I>S. aureus</I> carriage are available: local application of antibiotics or antiseptics; administration of systemic antibiotics; and the harnessing of bacterial interference through active culture of a minimally-pathogenic strain of <I>S. aureus</I> (bacterial interference is the term given to the effect that different micro-organisms can have on each other when they are present simultaneously). This interference can result in partial or complete inhibition of one micro-organism - desired in this case - though sometimes activity may be increased. The first strategy, namely local application of antibiotics or antiseptics is the most common, for example mupirocin nasal ointment, applied twice daily for five days, is particularly highly used. Mupirocin can be used for the eradication of both meticillin sensitive and meticillin resistant <I>S. aureus</I>, although MRSA resistance for mupirocin has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Henkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henkel 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by JK and MvR without blinding to authorship or journal using the criteria described below. The results of the validity criteria were summarised in a table and taken into account in the conclusions and discussion.</P>
<P>Quality checklist<BR/>All included trials were assessed for quality using a quality checklist that considered the following points:</P>
<P>1. Allocation concealment<BR/>Trials were awarded the following grades for allocation concealment:<BR/>A = Adequate: a randomisation method described that would not allow an investigator/participant to know or influence an intervention group before an eligible participant entered the study.<BR/>B = Unclear: trial states that it is 'randomised', but no information on the method used is available.<BR/>C = Inadequate: inadequate method of randomisation used, such as alternate medical record numbers or unsealed envelopes; or any information in the study that indicated that investigators or participants could influence the intervention group.</P>
<P>2. Blinding<BR/>The following points were graded as 'yes' for present, 'no' for absent, and 'not stated' if the relevant information is not stated in the trial report:<BR/>a. Blinding of investigators.<BR/>b. Blinding of participants.<BR/>c. Blinding of outcome assessor.<BR/>d. Blinding of data analysis.<BR/>The above was considered not to have been blinded if the treatment group can be identified in &gt; 20% of participants because of any side effects of the treatment.</P>
<P>3. Intention-to-treat analysis:<BR/>This evaluated whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised, and was graded as:<BR/>Yes - specifically stated by authors that intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken, and this was confirmed on study assessment.<BR/>Yes - not specifically stated, but confirmed on study assessment.<BR/>No - not reported, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis confirmed on study assessment. (Patients who were randomised were not included in the analysis because they did not receive the study intervention, they withdrew from the study or were not included because of protocol violation)<BR/>No - stated, but not confirmed upon study assessment.<BR/>Not stated.</P>
<P>4. Completeness of follow up<BR/>Percentage of participants excluded or lost to follow up was recorded.</P>

<P>Primary and secondary outcomes of the studies were analysed for each study individually, and, where appropriate combined across studies.</P>
<P>Infection rates and mortality were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

These four studies were classified as studies of high quality. Although not specified in the protocol we judged studies to be of high quality if they concealed allocation, undertook blinding and an ITT analysis. Two out of nine studies were of low quality (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Fontan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Fontan 1992</LINK>). Although not specified in the protocol we judged studies to be of low quality if they did not conceal allocation or if the method of allocation was unclear, no blinding was achieved or reported and an ITT analysis was not reported or confirmed.The allocation concealment of Garcia was inadequate because they used consecutive numbers, patients with even numbers were allocated to the treatment group and patients with odd numbers were control patients. In this study no placebo was used, so the study was not double-blind. A sensitivity analysis removing the unblinded study of Garcia was undertaken, although this was not pre specified in the protocol. Pérez-Fontan did not describe any blinding. This trial was analysed separately for all outcomes because they compared mupirocin with neomycin ointment, whilst all the other studies compared mupirocin with placebo or no treatment. Seven of nine studies performed an a priori sample size calculation based on the estimated infection rate in the control group and the aimed reduction rate in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mup-Study-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mup Study Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>).</P>

Harbarth reported the infection rate caused by meticillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I>, while the other studies reported the overall <I>S. aureus</I> infection rate caused by both meticillin-sensitive and meticillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I>.</P>
<P>Looking at individual study results, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mup-Study-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mup Study Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>) showed a significant effect of mupirocin on reducing the <I>S. aureus</I> infection rate, whilst the remaining trials found no significant difference between mupirocin and control. Pooling the eight studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 3%) demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in <I>S. aureus</I> infection rate associated with mupirocin (RR 0.55 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70, fixed-effect) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Whilst there was little or no statistical heterogeneity in this analysis, the trials included diverse patient populations comprising surgical patients, non-surgical patients and both haemodialysis and CAPD patients. This diversity of patient populations was also demonstrated in the range of types of <I>S. aureus</I> infections reported (bacteraemia, exit-site infections, episodes of peritonitis, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, surgical site infections (SSI) and urinary tract infections).</P>
<P>Pooling together only those studies which were judged to be of high quality, (i.e. studies meeting all quality criteria) (<LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>), also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in <I>S. aureus</I> infection rate associated with mupirocin (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00, fixed-effect) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We pre-specified in the protocol our plans to investigate whether there were differential effects of mupirocin in different groups, particularly surgical and non-surgical patients. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>) were confined to surgical patients and involved 686 patients in the treatment and 686 in the control group. These trials were pooled (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, fixed-effect) and showed a statistically significant reduction of the nosocomial <I>S. aureus</I> rate (RR 0.55 95% CI 0.34 to 0.88)(<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). This significant reduction was not affected by the exclusion of the low quality, non-blinded study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK>) (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91)(<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>When the analysis was confined to the outcome of <I>S. aureus</I> surgical site infection (this analysis was not pre-specified and therefore can only be described as exploratory) there was no longer a statistically significant effect of mupirocin however the comparison probably lacks statistical power (4 trials, 688 patients treated with mupirocin, 686 control patients, RR 0.63 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04)(<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

However, Perl reported mortality in both carriers and non-carriers, separate data on carriers were not available, so this study was not included in the mortality analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between treated and untreated carriers (RR 0.91 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31)(<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Only one study described whether mortality was from any cause or due to an infection (<LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>). In the placebo group two of the five deaths were from an infection, i.e. one death was related to a surgical site infection caused by <I>S. aureus</I> and one to pneumonia escalating to multi-organ failure.

Boelaert and Konvalinka reported that no side effects occurred in any of the 35 and 257 participants, respectively. Pérez-Fontan described slight nasal pruritus and an unpleasant smell immediately after administration of mupirocin (number of patients was not described). In the trial of the Mupirocin Study Group side effects were infrequent and mild, being equally common in treatment and placebo groups, and only a few patients were unable to tolerate the ointment (number of patients was not described). Perl reported the number of adverse events in both carriers and non-carriers. Data for carriers only were not available. 97 of the 2012 patients in the mupirocin group (4.8%) and 96 of the 2018 patients in the placebo group (4.8%) showed side effects such as rhinorrhea and itching at the application site. Five patients (one treated with mupirocin and four with placebo) withdrew from the study because of adverse events such as nasal burning, nasal bleeding, and headache. Perl stated that no deaths were attributed to mupirocin therapy. Wertheim mentioned 4 patients with an itching or burning sensation of the nose, of which 2 patients received mupirocin (n=793) and 2 placebo (n=809).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">REDUCTION OF S. AUREUS INFECTIONS BY APPLICATION OF MUPIROCIN</HEADING>
<P>Previously, several reviews in this area have been performed but these included both carriers and non-carriers of <I>S. aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Kallen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kallen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trautmann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trautmann 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK> evaluated the use of different antimicrobial approaches to prevent peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Nasal mupirocin compared with placebo significantly reduced the exit-site and tunnel infection rate but not peritonitis rate. <LINK REF="REF-Kallen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kallen 2005</LINK> found no significant effect of mupirocin on the surgical site infection rate after general surgery. However, in non general surgery (cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery) a significant reduction was found. In contrast, Trautmann concluded that mupirocin prophylaxis did not reduce the <I>S. aureus </I>surgical site infection rate in patients undergoing orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and cardiothoracic surgery. <LINK REF="REF-Laupland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupland 2003</LINK> reported that prophylactic treatment of patients with intranasal mupirocin in large trials did not lead to a significant reduction in the overall rate of infections. However, subgroup analyses and several small studies revealed lower rates of <I>S. aureus</I> infection among selected populations of patients with nasal carriage treated with mupirocin. Our review is the first one that included nasal <I>S. aureus c</I>arriers only. Nasal mupirocin ointment reduced the overall <I>S. aureus</I> infection rate in nasal carriers. This analysis included surgical patients, non surgical patients and dialysis patients. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant effect in dialysis patients and surgical patients. When the surgical site infections were analysed as primary outcome in surgical patients, no statistically significant effect was found.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">SECONDARY OUTCOMES</HEADING>
<P>Wertheim did not find a significant difference in number of infections between non surgical patients treated with mupirocin or placebo, but they reported a significantly longer time to infection in the per-protocol analysis of patients treated with mupirocin (p=0.02). So, possibly mupirocin protects patients from getting infected for the first period after treatment. However, this outcome was only reported in one study and no significance was found in their intention-to-treat analysis, although they did not use the correct statistical analysis.<BR/>The mortality between mupirocin and control groups was not significantly different and no serious adverse events were mentioned. Analysis of the infection rate caused by micro-organisms other than <I>S. aureus </I>showed significant more infections caused by other micro-organisms in the mupirocin group (RR 1.38 95% CI 1.11 to 1.72). It is possible that infections with other micro-organisms replace the infections caused by <I>S. aureus</I>. Maybe by reducing the <I>S. aureus</I> carriage, it makes someone more susceptible to other micro-organisms. More research in this field is required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE</HEADING>
<P>Up till now routine use of mupirocin has not been applied in many hospitals, mainly because due to concern about the development of mupirocin resistance and the absence of convincing evidence that mupirocin reduces the infection rate. Resistance has been observed when mupirocin was used for prolonged periods, especially when it was used as a skin ointment (Hudson 1994). However, <LINK REF="REF-Fawley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawley 2006</LINK> observed no trend towards increasing prevalence of mupirocin resistance during a 4-year study period with mupirocin use in surgical patients. In our review, five studies reported that no development of resistance to mupirocin in the isolated <I>S. aureus</I> strains was found during the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Boelaert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boelaert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Fontan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Fontan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>). During the 4-year study Perl found 6 of the 1021 tested <I>S. aureus</I> isolates were resistant to mupirocin. In the study of Harbarth 4 strains acquired low-level mupirocin resistance during mupirocin therapy. The Mup Study Group showed that low-level and high-level resistance occurred in both groups, but there was no evidence that treatment with mupirocin resulted in colonisation with resistant <I>S. aureus</I>. It can be concluded that mupirocin resistance will not be a problem after short-term intranasal use in surgical or dialysis patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ENDOGENOUS INFECTIONS</HEADING>
<P>Mupirocin is applied to prevent patients infecting themselves with endogenous bacteria and therefore, although this was not prespecified in the protocol, it is interesting to know how many of the infections were caused by the endogenous strain. Included studies mentioned that in about 80% of the infections the <I>S. aureus</I> strain isolated from the nares was identical to that isolated from the infected site (<LINK REF="STD-Boelaert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boelaert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>). They did not describe the number of endogenous infections in the mupirocin and placebo groups separately, so it was impossible to analyse the difference in the number of endogenous infections between both groups. Probably, in both the mupirocin and control group there will be a comparable number of infections caused by strains from the environment, for example from the health care workers in the operation room, while a higher number of endogenous infections is expected to be found in the control group. Kalmeijer described fewer endogenous infections in the mupirocin group, but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.19 95% CI 0.02 to 1.62). However, in this analysis both carriers and non-carriers were included. When patients treated with mupirocin develop an infection with the nose strain, it can be assumed that mupirocin treatment failed. Nasal carriage is eliminated in about 80% of patients treated with mupirocin and 30% in those treated with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>). The number of endogenous infections was not prespecified in our protocol, but should be considered in future studies/reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">LIMITS</HEADING>
<P>There are several limitations of the included studies and the review. The quality of the studies varied from high to low quality, i.e. only four of the nine included studies were studies of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Kalmeijer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kalmeijer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>). Second, the primary outcomes were reported by all studies, but there was limited information for some of the secondary outcomes, i.e. time to infection was described in one of the nine included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>), mortality in 5 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boelaert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boelaert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mup-Study-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mup Study Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>), adverse events in 6 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boelaert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boelaert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Fontan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Fontan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mup-Study-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mup Study Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 2004b</LINK>) and the infection rate caused by other micro-organisms than <I>S. aureus</I> in 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Konvalinka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konvalinka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mup-Study-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mup Study Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Fontan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Fontan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perl 2002</LINK>). Third, the possibility of publication bias was not assessed in the review. It is likely that studies without a significant reduction of the infection rate are harder to publish than studies with a significant effect. Fourth, although no statistical heterogeneity was found, a lot of clinical heterogeneity existed between patient populations of the included studies. Furthermore, we assessed the <I>S. aureus </I>infection rate as primary outcome, i.e. both meticillin-susceptible and meticillin-resistant <I>S. aureus </I>infections were included. Only one study assessed the number of meticillin-resistant infections (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>), so no subgroup analysis could be performed to study the effect of mupirocin on the infection rate caused by meticillin-resistant <I>S. aureus </I>in patients with nasal carriage of this variant of <I>S. aureus</I>.</P>

Short-term use of intranasal mupirocin ointment does not seem to be associated with resistance.

<P>This review shows that the effectiveness of mupirocin is related to carriers only. Recent technological advances in rapid diagnostics have provided the ability to detect nasal carriage of <I>S. aureus</I> within hours rather than days (<LINK REF="REF-Francois-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francois 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paule-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paule 2004</LINK>), which makes it possible to treat nasal carriers rapidly. At the moment, rapid tests that can discriminate MRSA from MSSA are being evaluated. Application of these tests will result in timely, appropriate prescription of anti microbials (both local and systemic).</P>
