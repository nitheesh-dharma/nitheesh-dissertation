<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:39:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">What is tuberculous pleurisy and how might corticosteroids work?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:40:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculous pleurisy results from inflammation of the membrane that covers the lungs (the pleura) caused by exposure to <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> bacteria infecting the lungs. This results in a build up of fluid around the lung (pleural effusion) that causes pain and fever, impairs breathing, and may lead to impairment of lung function in the long term.</P>
<P>Some clinicians believe that corticosteroids used in combination with antituberculous drugs can speed up the recovery from TB pleurisy and help to prevent long-term complications.</P>
<P>
<B>What the evidence shows</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the available evidence up to 13 April 2016 and included six trials with 590 people, which evaluated prednisolone given with antituberculous treatment (ATT). One included trial was of high quality, while the rest had uncertainties regarding trial quality. All the included trials were in adults; one trial included only HIV-positive people, two included only HIV-negative people, and three did not report the HIV status of the participants. </P>
<P>Corticosteroids may reduce the time to resolution of the symptoms of TB pleurisy and the time to resolution of the pleural effusion on chest X-ray (<I>low certainty evidence). </I>Corticosteroids may also reduce the risk of having signs of pleural scarring on chest X-ray (pleural thickening and pleural adhesions) after the disease has resolved (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). There was not enough information about lung function to be sure whether or not corticosteroids reduce the risk of lung function impairment after TB pleurisy (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids may increase the risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). From one trial in people living with HIV, there was no detectable increase in HIV-related conditions with corticosteroids, although cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were only seen in the corticosteroid group and numbers of participants and events were too small to rule out an effect of corticosteroids (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>As the risk of disability and long-term illness after TB pleurisy is unclear, research looking at the association between TB pleurisy and lung function impairment would be useful to inform future research into corticosteroids for TB pleurisy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-14 17:18:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Corticosteroids used in addition to antituberculous therapy have been reported to benefit people with tuberculous pleurisy. However, research findings are inconsistent and raise doubt as to whether such treatment is worthwhile. There is also concern regarding the potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in HIV-positive people.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of adding corticosteroids to drug regimens for tuberculous pleural effusion.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:33:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In April 2016, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, and the reference lists of articles identified by the literature search. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:33:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared any corticosteroid with no treatment, placebo, or other active treatment (both groups should have received the same antituberculous drug regimen) in people diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:34:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data from the included trials, and assessed trial methodological quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We applied the fixed-effect model in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-12 22:06:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials with 590 participants met the inclusion criteria, which were conducted in Asia (three trials), Africa (two trials), and Europe (one trial). Two trials were in HIV-negative people, one trial was in HIV-positive people, and three trials did not report HIV status.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids may reduce the time to resolution of pleural effusion. Risk of residual pleural effusion on chest X-ray was reduced by 45% at eight weeks (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; 237 participants, 2 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>), and 65% at 24 weeks (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66; 237 participants, 2 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Compared with control, corticosteroids may reduce the risk of having pleural changes (such as pleural thickening or pleural adhesions), on chest X-ray at the end of follow-up by almost one third (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 393 participants, 5 trials,<I> low certainty evidence</I>), which translates to an absolute risk reduction of 16%.</P>
<P>One trial reported deaths in people that were HIV-positive, with no obvious difference between the groups; the trial authors' analysis suggests that the deaths observed in this trial were related to HIV disease rather than pleural TB (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 197 participants, 1 trial).</P>
<P>We found limited data on long-term functional respiratory impairment on 187 people in two trials, which reported that average percentage predicted forced vital capacity was similar in the group receiving prednisolone and in the control group (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The risk of adverse events that led to discontinuation of the trial drug was higher in people with pleural TB receiving corticosteroids (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.94; 587 participants, 6 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>). The trial in HIV-positive people reported on six different HIV-related infections, with no obvious differences. However, cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were only seen in the corticosteroid group (with 6/99 cases in the steroid group compared to 0/98 in the control group) (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-20 10:58:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-term respiratory function is potentially the most important outcome for assessing the effects of adjunctive treatments for people with pleural TB. However, the information on the impact of pleural TB on long-term respiratory function is unknown and could be eclipsed by other risk factors, such as concurrent pulmonary TB, smoking, and HIV. This probably needs to be quantified to help decide whether further trials of corticosteroids for pleural TB would be worthwhile.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:15:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </I>complex, and is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. In 2014 approximately 9.6 million people newly developed the disease and there were 1.5 million deaths globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). TB infects the lungs, and is transmitted by droplet spread from coughing people with active pulmonary TB, but it can also spread to other body sites and cause extrapulmonary TB (EPTB).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:46:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pleural TB is one of the most common forms of EPTB, with an incidence of 3% to 25% of people with TB (<LINK REF="REF-Light-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2004</LINK>). The incidence is higher in high TB prevalence settings (<LINK REF="REF-Jeon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeon 2014</LINK>). Immune compromise is an important risk factor for all forms of TB, and evidence suggests that pleural TB is more common in people living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Batungwanayo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batungwanayo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frye-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frye 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pozniak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozniak 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saks-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saks 1992</LINK>). Pleural TB can be a manifestation of TB disease post-primary infection, or due to reactivation of latent TB (<LINK REF="REF-Light-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically, pleural TB presents as an acute illness consisting of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath (<LINK REF="REF-Morehead-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morehead 1998</LINK>), and usually a pleural effusion is demonstrated on chest X-ray. Pleural TB usually resolves without treatment of any kind, but untreated patients may experience longer duration of the acute symptoms and risk recurrence of active TB at a later point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Light-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 2010</LINK>). Pleural TB can be complicated by massive effusion leading to respiratory compromise in the short term, and pleural thickening, fibrosis, and pleural adhesions causing impaired respiratory function in the medium- to long-term.</P>
<P>Pleural TB is thought to be caused by a delayed type (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction following release of mycobacterial antigens into the pleural space (<LINK REF="REF-Rossi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 1987</LINK>), as a result of rupture of a subpleural focus of TB infection in the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 1955</LINK>). This explains the tendency towards resolution of the effusion and associated symptoms with or without treatment of the TB infection, and the fact that culture of pleural fluid is nearly always negative for <I>M. tuberculosis</I>. There appears to be a spectrum of disease in pleural TB in terms of the extent of the underlying lung infection, which could be important in terms of patient outcomes and the potential for corticosteroids to be effective (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A systematic review that includes 18 trials and 3816 participants suggests that corticosteroids probably do not improve mortality rates, sputum smear or culture conversion in people with pulmonary TB (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 2014</LINK>). One cohort study of people with pleural TB in Spain reported evidence of pulmonary TB infection on chest X-ray in 20% of 254 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Vald_x00e9_s-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdés 1998</LINK>). Pulmonary involvement rose to 86% in another cohort where computed tomography (CT) scanning was used (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Shu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shu 2011</LINK> demonstrated that pulmonary involvement (as defined by positive sputum culture and/or chest X-ray appearances) was an important predictor of mortality in hospitalised pleural TB patients in Korea, and was associated with a longer hospital stay.</P>
<P>Diagnosis of pleural TB can be challenging with traditional microscopy and culture methods being relatively insensitive when used on pleural fluid, and newer modalities such as Xpert® MTB/RIF have similar limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Denkinger-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denkinger 2014</LINK>). Histopathological examination and mycobacterial culture performed on pleural biopsy samples are regarded as more reliable tests, and yielded a diagnosis in 227/248 patients (91%) in one cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Vald_x00e9_s-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdés 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:15:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Corticosteroids are hormones produced by the adrenal cortex which have a variety of physiological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, regulation of electrolytes, the stress response and control of inflammation. Corticosteroids induce their anti-inflammatory effect through the regulation of gene expression in cells, leading to increased expression of genes which inhibit inflammatory pathways, and repression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2006</LINK>). Multiple synthetic forms of these hormones have been produced and are used in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid derived from cortisol, and prednisone is a pro-drug that is converted into the active form prednisolone by the liver. Several formulations of each drug are used for different conditions and diseases; in TB pleurisy patients are usually offered them in tablet form.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids have been used in medicine for many decades, and have well-characterised adverse effect profiles. Adverse effects for medium to long-term use include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, gastric ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, thinning of the skin, proximal myopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and development of moon face, striae and acne (Cushing's syndrome). The use of synthetic corticosteroids can induce adrenocorticoid insufficiency, and so patients receiving more than one week's treatment must have the dose slowly reduced to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency causing hypotension and hypoglycaemia which can be life-threatening (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2016</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-16 18:17:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapeutic options for pleural space infections include intravenous antibiotic administration, chest tube drainage, intrapleural administration of a fibrinolytic agent to dissolve fibrous adhesions, thoracotomy to remove fibrinous and infected tissue, and steroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The theoretical basis for using corticosteroids is that they suppress the delayed type hypersensitivity inflammatory response triggered by the release of tubercular antigens into the pleural space which is believed to be responsible for tuberculous pleurisy. One corticosteroid is prednisone, which is converted in the liver into the active drug, prednisolone. Prednisolone is recommended at a daily dose of about 1 mg/kg gradually reducing after one to two weeks, with a total treatment course sometimes being as long as three months (<LINK REF="REF-Lemaistre-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemaistre 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathur-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morehead-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morehead 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, produced mainly via suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression and activation of anti-inflammatory genes (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2006</LINK>). While the inflammatory response is necessary to control the infection, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue damage and fibrosis, which could cause long-term morbidity. Suppression of the inflammatory response in pleural TB could reduce the symptoms and signs associated with the inflammatory process: fever, progression of the pleural effusion, malaise. Corticosteroids could therefore reduce the duration or severity of symptoms in the short term, and also reduce the risk of tissue damage leading to lung impairment in the long term.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-29 19:46:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies of adjunctive corticosteroids for the treatment of tuberculous pleural effusion show conflicting results. Non-randomized studies in the pre-HIV era found that corticosteroids led to more rapid resolution of the effusion and reduced likelihood of residual pleural thickening and pleural adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Menon-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1965</LINK>). An observational study of 165 HIV-positive participants with tuberculous pleural effusion found that prednisolone was associated with decreasing rates of lymphadenopathy and cough as well as improved survival (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1992</LINK>; Elliott personal communication).</P>
<P>In contrast, a critical appraisal of published studies demonstrated beneficial effects of corticosteroids on acute symptoms, but it found no benefit for chronic endpoints such as fibrosis, irrespective of dose (<LINK REF="REF-Dooley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dooley 1997</LINK>). The authors noted that many of the studies lacked rigour and clinical correlations. The previous version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 2007</LINK>), which included six trials and 633 participants, concluded that data were insufficient to support the use of corticosteroids in pleural TB.</P>
<P>In addition to the uncertainty about benefits of corticosteroid therapy, there is concern about potential risks. In immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV, corticosteroids may further constrain the immune system leading to an increased frequency of opportunistic infections and tumours such as Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular tumour accompanied by numerous unconnected lesions of the skin and associated with human herpes virus-8 infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ensoli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ensoli 2001</LINK>). More generally, adverse effects of corticosteroids such as fluid retention and gastrointestinal disturbances have also been documented in people with TB (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1983</LINK>). Other adverse effects associated with corticosteroids include high blood pressure, high blood glucose or exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus, weight gain, increased susceptibility to infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and in long-term use osteoporosis and changes to the skin and face.</P>
<P>We updated this review with the aim of adding any new evidence that may have been published since the previous search in 2007. For this version, we revised the protocol, and in particular altered the outcomes of interest. This was informed by discussions with expert clinicians which took place during the development of a new guideline on extrapulmonary TB in India, the INDEX-TB guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-INDEX_x002d_TB-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">INDEX-TB 2016</LINK>).</P>

When we excluded trials that were at high risk of bias for selection bias (randomization and allocation concealment) from the meta-analysis, the statistical heterogeneity resolved. In these two trials it is possible that the trial investigators allocated a greater proportion of participants with more severe pleural effusions to the corticosteroid group, believing that corticosteroids would be of benefit to them (<LINK REF="STD-Bang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1999</LINK>).

<P>See 'Summary of findings' table 1 (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six trials met the inclusion criteria; we have not included any new trials since the 2007 version of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 2007</LINK>), and we did not find any trials in progress that address this question.</P>
<P>There was a trend towards faster resolution of symptoms, such as fever and chest pain, with corticosteroids across all included trials, but the trials reported insufficient data to produce a meta-analysis addressing time to resolution of symptoms, and there were variations across studies in terms of which symptoms were reported and who the participants were monitored and assessed.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids probably reduce the time to resolution of pleural effusion.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids may reduce risk of pleural changes on chest X-ray at the end of treatment by 28% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 393 participants, 5 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>). On average, half the participants in the control group had pleural changes at the end of at least six months, giving an estimated absolute risk reduction of 14% with corticosteroids.</P>
<P>There was insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effect of corticosteroids on respiratory function after treatment, and none of the included trials reported on disability after treatment. Only one trial reported on death (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>), and the trial authors' analysis suggests that death was related to low CD4+ cell counts, which implied that death was related to severity of HIV disease. Corticosteroids had no effect on all-cause mortality in this trial (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 197 participants, 1 trial).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids may increase risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.94; 587 participants, 6 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>). Commonly reported adverse effects included epigastric pain, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia.</P>
<P>Only one trial included HIV-positive people and reported on HIV-associated adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>). While there was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and placebo groups for any of the conditions observed, Kaposi's sarcoma was only observed in the group receiving steroids: 6/99 in the corticosteroid group developed Kaposi's sarcoma compared with 0/98 in the placebo group (RR 12.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 225.40; 197 participants, 1 trial, <I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-27 14:57:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The six trials included male and female participants, who were mostly HIV-negative adults. One trial included children over the age of 11 years (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>), and one trial included only HIV-positive adults (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>). The trials reflected the fact that pleural TB is more common in adults, but HIV-positive people are under-represented in this review, and the results of the pooled estimates may be less applicable to HIV-positive people. The included trials were all conducted in tertiary hospital settings, in a countries varying from low to high TB burden and HIV prevalence.</P>
<P>The method of diagnosis of pleural TB varied between the included trials (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), but were representative of diagnostic tests commonly available in high- and middle-income settings. Culture and histopathology are less accessible in low-income settings, where diagnosis may be based on clinical presentation and X-ray findings alone.</P>
<P>The antituberculous treatment (ATT) that participants received varied across the included trials, and in some trials the treatment given was significantly different from widely recommended first-line treatment for drug-sensitive TB (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Most notably, the older trials included either two drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1988</LINK>), or three drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1996</LINK>), in their regimens rather than all four currently recommended first-line drugs in the intensive phase of treatment. Participants were given at least six months of ATT in all trials. This variation in ATT was not associated with statistically significant heterogeneity in any of our analyses. As the more recent trials used regimens that are the same or very similar to currently recommended regimens for drug-sensitive TB, it is unlikely that the variation in ATT regimens between the trials limits the applicability of the evidence.</P>
<P>For some outcomes, such as respiratory function and time to resolution of symptoms, incomplete reporting of data and differences in units meant that we could not combine data to generate a summary effects estimate.</P>

<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>), and reported the outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For time to resolution of pleural effusion, we combined data on residual pleural fluid on chest X-ray from four trials. As described in the results section, after exploring high unexplained statistical heterogeneity for this outcome, we chose to exclude the two trials that were at high risk of selection bias from the final analysis to avoid a misleading summary estimate of effect. The exclusion of studies from the meta analysis generates uncertainty, and therefore we chose to downgrade by one because of this. We also downgraded for imprecision; the number of participants and events is small, the meta analysis is probably underpowered.</P>
<P>We graded the summary effects estimate for pleural changes at the end of treatment as low certainty evidence, and downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias relating to randomization and allocation methods, and for imprecision relating to the relatively small number of events and participants.</P>
<P>For long-term functional respiratory impairment, we graded the quality of the evidence as very low. Meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome due to insufficient reporting of data, and we reported the available data in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>. Although two trials reported the mean percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1996</LINK>), neither the results per participant nor the variance were reported.</P>
<P>For adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low. We downgraded for risk of bias relating to randomization and allocation concealment, and also reporting as some trials did not report on adverse events in detail. Also a few only referred to adverse effects associated with steroids in the steroid group, which raised the concern that adverse events in the control group were not detected or reported.</P>
<P>For adverse events relating to HIV, we graded the estimates of effect relating to two serious, life-threatening HIV-related diseases &#8212; cryptococcal meningitis and Kaposi's sarcoma &#8212; and judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded by two for imprecision caused by the small number of events and participants, and also by one for indirectness as the participants were all from one single-centre trial and none were on antiretroviral therapy. These estimates of effect may not be applicable to HIV-positive people in other settings or those taking antiretroviral therapy.</P>

<P>The included trials in this review do not provide substantive evidence on patient-important outcomes to guide recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in people with TB pleurisy. The efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing the time to resolution of pleural effusion or symptoms is uncertain, although the included trials that were at low risk of bias did demonstrate more rapid resolution of pleural effusion on chest X-ray in participants treated with corticosteroids. There may be a decreased risk of pleural changes such as pleural thickening and pleural adhesions on chest X-ray at the end of treatment with corticosteroids, but it is unclear how this relates to patient-important outcomes such as disability, lung function, and mortality. The concerns raised regarding adverse events in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive people with pleural TB need to be taken into account when deciding whether or not to use corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Current guidelines for TB treatment do not recommend the use of corticosteroids in pleural TB (<LINK REF="REF-INDEX_x002d_TB-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">INDEX-TB 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:15:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The literature search performed for this update revealed no new trials that compared corticosteroids to placebo in people with pleural TB, and no trials are ongoing at the time of publication of this Cochrane Review. We prepared a rapid update of this review as part of the development process of guidelines on extrapulmonary TB in India, the INDEX-TB Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-INDEX_x002d_TB-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">INDEX-TB 2016</LINK>). During discussions regarding the use of corticosteroids for pleural TB, the guideline panel noted that, as pleural TB is generally associated with low mortality, the priority outcome for consideration is lung function. The panel felt that the main outcomes in the available studies are at best proxy measures for lung function, and, given the evidence for adverse effects of corticosteroids, made a conditional recommendation against their use in pleural TB.</P>
<P>It is notable that the two trials included in this review that do report on lung function suggest that, while there was no qualitative difference between the two treatment groups, many people who have been successfully treated for pleural TB have poorer than expected lung function. There are still questions to be answered regarding lung function, disability, and mortality after pleural TB.</P>
<P>A systematic review of studies that investigated the prevalence of chronic lung disease in general populations concluded that pulmonary TB is strongly associated with chronic lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 2015</LINK>). Two studies included in the review showed a stronger association between pulmonary TB and chronic lung disease in non-smokers than in smokers, which suggested that the relationship is not due to confounding risk factors alone. Indeed, the association between pulmonary TB and chronic lung disease has been recognized for many decades. More recently the interconnected causal relationships between TB, HIV, smoking, and chronic lung disease have been further elucidated, although many questions regarding pathophysiology remain unanswered (<LINK REF="REF-van-Zyl-Smit-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Zyl Smit 2010</LINK>). There is less evidence regarding the association between pleural TB and chronic lung disease or respiratory impairment. <LINK REF="REF-Candela-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candela 2003</LINK> reported on functional sequelae in terms of pulmonary function testing in a cohort of 81 Spanish adults with pleural TB with a median follow-up time of 23 months after diagnosis. Investigators found that 8/81 (10%) of the participants had a restrictive ventilatory deficit (one or both of FVC and TLC &lt; 80% of predicted, with a FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio &gt; 80% of predicted) at the end of follow-up, which they describe as mild to moderate in all but two cases who were both smokers with a pre-existing diagnosis of COPD. They found no statistically significant association between residual pleural thickening on chest X-ray and functional sequelae at end of follow-up, although the sample was too small to rule out an association. They also found that the pleural fluid profile of participants that went on to have a restrictive ventilatory deficit demonstrated lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase and higher lymphocyte count, suggesting a difference in the inflammatory response in the pleural space. Their results provide context to the results of this review: if there is poor correlation between pleural thickening on chest X-ray and functional sequelae, we cannot conclude that if corticosteroids reduce pleural thickening they are likely to be of benefit in terms reducing rates of lung function impairment.</P>
<P>Given the uncertainties that exist, further research is warranted to explore the relevance of discriminating between people presenting with isolated pleural TB and pleuro-pulmonary TB, using different imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasound. Cohort studies are needed in people who have pleural TB of either type to assess the incidence of functional sequelae, as measured using spirometry and also disability metrics validated for disability related to impaired lung function. The utility of further randomized controlled trials for corticosteroids in pleural TB would be informed by the results of such research.</P>

<P>We updated this review with the aim of adding any new evidence that may have been published since the previous search in 2007. For this version, we revised the protocol, and in particular altered the outcomes of interest. This was informed by discussions with expert clinicians which took place during the development of a new guideline on extrapulmonary TB in India, the INDEX-TB guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-INDEX_x002d_TB-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">INDEX-TB 2016</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by one for risk of bias: of the four trials that reported this outcome, we excluded two trials from the final analysis due to high risk of selection bias, after a subgroup analysis suggested the pooled estimate including these studies could be misleading (<LINK REF="STD-Bang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1999</LINK>). We judged this to be our best estimate of effect. However because we excluded trials from this analysis this generates uncertainty, so we have downgraded the quality of the evidence.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Not downgraded for inconsistency: heterogeneity in the original meta-analysis was likely due to differences in study quality. A subgroup analysis showed that statistical heterogeneity disappeared when we excluded trials that were at high risk of selection bias.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by one for imprecision: the CI around the summary effect estimate is wide due to the small number of participants and events in each included trial.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Not downgraded for indirectness: the included trials were performed in different settings and time periods and used widely available drugs and diagnostic techniques. Although the trials did not include children, we did not downgrade as pleural TB is less common in children than in adults. One trial included HIV-positive people, <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>, and this trial contributed most of the participants in the meta-analysis. When making recommendations relating to the use of corticosteroids for pleural TB in children or in HIV-negative adults, guideline panels may wish to consider downgrading for indirectness.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by one for serious risk of bias: we assessed two trials as at high risk of bias for randomization method (<LINK REF="STD-Bang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1999</LINK>), and the other three trials were at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1996</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1996</LINK> reported that outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment allocation.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Downgraded by one for serious imprecision: the CI around the summary effect estimate is wide, ranging from a maximum risk reduction with steroids of 43% to a minimum risk reduction of 7%, which may not be clinically significant when weighed against possible harms of steroids.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Not downgraded for indirectness: the trials were performed in a variety of settings, and all used drugs and diagnostic techniques that are widely available. We did not include any HIV-positive people in this meta-analysis, so when making recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in HIV-positive people with TB pleurisy, guideline panels may wish to consider downgrading for indirectness. Only one trial included children aged over 11 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>), but we did not downgrade as pleural TB is not common in children.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Two of the six trials reported pulmonary function tests at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1996</LINK>), but data were insufficient to combine these outcomes in a meta-analysis. The data are in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>, and suggest that in these trials there was little or no difference in mean percentage predicted FVC at the end of treatment. The number of participants in each group with pulmonary function tests suggestive of a functional respiratory impairment are not reported.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by one for risk of bias: there were concerns about randomization method and allocation concealment. Additionally, reporting of adverse events varied significantly across the trials, and some trials only reported on adverse events in the steroid group, and it is likely that some trials did not detect or report all adverse events.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by one for serious imprecision: the CI around the summary effect estimate is wide, with a maximum increased risk of adverse effects leading to study drug discontinuation of nearly 700% and a minimum increased risk of 12%, which may not be clinically significant when weighed against possible benefits of steroids.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Downgraded by two for serious imprecision: the CI around the summary effect estimate is very wide, and possible effects range from large benefits to significant harms.<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP>Downgraded by one for indirectness: only one trial included HIV-positive people and assessed HIV-related adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>). Participants in this trial were not treated with antiretroviral therapy, which is known to prevent cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive people; therefore this estimate may not be applicable to HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy. This trial did not include any children.<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP>Prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma of 1.4% in HIV-positive adults on clinic enrolment taken from <LINK REF="REF-Semeere-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semeere 2016</LINK>, a multi-centre prospective cohort study performed in Uganda and Kenya.<BR/>
<SUP>14</SUP>Downgraded by two for serious imprecision: the CI around the summary effect estimate is very wide, and possible effects range from large benefits to significant harms.<BR/>
<SUP>15</SUP>Downgraded by one for indirectness: only one trial included HIV-positive people and assessed HIV-related adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2004</LINK>). Participants in this trial were not treated with antiretroviral therapy, which is known to treat and prevent Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-positive people, therefore this estimate may not be applicable to HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy. This trial did not include any children.</P>
