As you will see there are a few changes in tracks - please have a look though tem before accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never seen deaths listed as a side effect before - could that be moved back to being a separate outcome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;acute exacerbations and hospitalisation - should be 2 outcomes??&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;have now edited the list in accordance with how the rest of the review is set up, so it's probably not an issue!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Results of the search - please add a short description of the number of references - Liz to add a set-paragraph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include a short description of the other sources of bias identified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have included the number of participants for &lt;i&gt;each&lt;/i&gt; reported outcome - either in the text or with the treatment in parenthesis as you have been doing mostly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise capacity - not sure why you did SMD instead of MD since the outcome was the same?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph in the summary of main results is a good summary of the main results and is what is required in this section. The rest should be moved and integrated elsewhere in the discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charateristics of included studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;check the highlighted parts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add details of study sponsorship to the notes for each study&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For tables such as the characteristics of included studies table, please add the abbreviations to the footnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plagiarism -&lt;/b&gt; we run a plagiarism report on all reviews. There was quiet a bit of text highlighted in yours, but I think that it is &amp;quot;self-plagiarism&amp;quot; from earlier versions of this review. We do not regard so-called self-plagiarism as an issue (to stop this would require re-writing of the entire review which is a waste of time in my opinion). However, can you double check where you have reference Evans 1996, Evans 2007 and Evans 2003, that you have referenced them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma J notes 17.11.14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Please make sure you do a validation report check. I've addressed all the issues other than this one 'An I&amp;#178; of 96% represents highly inconsistent findings across studies, and may indicate an error in the data.' See Chris's comments as this may have come from using SE as an SD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) References: I've addressed lots of issues. Had to leave Cipolla 2011 &amp;#8211; no page/abstract numbers (I can&amp;#8217;t access the proceedings to check); please insert this info. Copyeditor will pick this up otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) In study design section, I&amp;#8217;ve reworded so no longer &amp;#8220;one from&amp;#8230;one from&amp;#8230;one from&amp;#8230;.etc&amp;#8221;. Also re-jigged because Scotland is part of the UK. Presuming reference to Korea means &amp;#8216;South&amp;#8217; rather than &amp;#8216;North&amp;#8217;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) No &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; needed when references are in brackets. I've amended all I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Please add text to 'Results of search' so that it's compatible with PRISMA diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) Please amend PLS in line with Cochrane's minimum standards and suggested headings https://airways.cochrane.org/sites/airways.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Update Edit Feb 20 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: checked by Susan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine. I have added a note that resistance remains a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients exacerbating in cross-overs is difficult so I have removed the Cymbala data and this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: This is ready for submission. thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================================&lt;br&gt;THIS IS NOW READY FOR THE LIBRARY. THANKS, CHRIS. 6_6_03&lt;br&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;br&gt;Below is David Evans' rebuttal for the reviewers. I have pasted the accompanying word document over the text so this is rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged antibiotics for purulent bronchiectasis&lt;br&gt;Evans DJ, Bara AI, Greenstone M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses to referees&lt;br&gt;We are grateful to the referees for supplying comments on this review and we shall address the points in turn. Where changes to the manuscript have been made, these are noted in these responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Tobramycin is licensed for inhalation. The product is Tobi, PathoGenesis Corporation, Seattle, WA and is formulated as a nebuliser solution. This was the drug used in the study reported by Barker et al. Given this license we have not discussed this issue in the text of the review. FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) We accept that the review reports the use of antibiotics over durations shorter than previously outlined in the initial protocol. We concluded that the 'long term' use of antibiotics was better defined by the use of this treatment modality in patients whose condition was stable i.e. not for the treatment of exacerbations, and that the treatment duration was obviously longer that a usual course of antibiotics. This use of antibiotics, to maintain stable disease and prevent progression and exacerbations, was considered distinct from the use of these drugs in the setting of acute infection and different from the therapeutic intent of trying to retrieve clinical stability. Furthermore the use of inhaled antibiotics was considered solely for prophylaxis and we are not aware of the efficacy of this treatment route for the management of exacerbations. We were satisfied that all of the six trials included in the review fulfilled the criteria for long term antibiotics by these definitions. OK&lt;br&gt;With respect to endpoint analysis, those parameters that examine stable phase symptom control/quality of life and markers of disease progression, such as lung function, were felt to be appropriate for analysis in this treatment context. Obviously exacerbation rates are a surrogate marker of long term antibiotic treatment failure and are suited to this sort of analysis.&lt;br&gt;A statement summarising these issues has been included in the discussion (paragraph 6, Discussion section).GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The issue regarding Pseudomonas colonisation is mentioned and we do acknowledge the worse prognosis of patients with this organism in that discussion (paragraph 8, Discussion section). The study that addresses this issue ( Evans SA et al Eur Resp J 1996;9:160) has been quoted in the review to support the case for drawing a distinction between these patients and those who do not culture the organism. We agree that this is an important point and it is regrettable that there is insufficient evidence to date to fully explore the use of long term antibiotics in these patients. GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) We agree that physiotherapy is central to the management of bronchiectasis. We also agree that the intervention with long term antibiotics is designed to improve the prognosis of the condition. The lack of evidence of these strategies is obviously not necessarily due to their failure but possibly due to the inadequacy of the evidence base (no data) as well as the shortfalls of various studies/reviews that have been reported to have the power to show positive effects i.e. type 2 errors. This issue is discussed in the discussion section and a sentence has been added to the Background paragraph of the abstract to introduce this concept. GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) We agree that resistance is a potentially very serious adverse event. Only Currie and Barker reported data for increasing resistance patterns and these effects were small. No data were presented for MRC, Tsang and Koh. Orriels evaluated the question and stated that no emerging resistance evolved when comparing the treatment groups. The question remains unanswered although the wider evidence base for antibiotic resistance in bronchiectasis (non-pseudomonas colonised patients) has cast doubt on the importance of in vitro sensitivities as a predictor of clinical responses to treatment. Tailored antibiotic treatments for pseudomonas remain dependent on sensitivity patterns. The review has not elucidated this issue and a statement to that effect has been added to the discussion. GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;Technical editing by CJC 0N 10_12_2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors Contribution: FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Title is missing from Barker 2000, please add this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TJL 19 12 02): THIS HAS BEEN ADDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Good. I assume that the trials are all parallel - perhaps this could be added to the trial characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TJL 19 12 02): DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: In the first and fifth outcomes you have entered the control event rates in the first column. This is confusing and should be re-entered with the treatment group in the first column (it should always be this way around). You then need to relabel the graph axis to show treatment is better to the right (what does response mean, presumably number of patients with no exacerbation or similar, perhaps make the label clearer please). Similarly Outcome 2 should be labelled as number of patients with an exacerbation (or without depending on how you put the data in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TJL 20 12 02) I HAVE READ BOTH PAPERS THERE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF RESPONSE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BARKER: DICHOTOMOUS IMPROVED NOT IMPROVED ACCORDING TO SUBJECTIVE PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT.&lt;br&gt;CURRIE ET AL: RESPONSE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED BY DIARY CARD (COULD BE SAME WAY AS BARKER). HOWEVER THERE IS STRATIFICATION OF IMPROVEMENT, DESCRIBED AS 'DEFINITELY' AND 'POSSIBLY' IMPROVED. THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED AND ENTERED AS IMPROVED AND NOT IMPROVED. SHOULD I SUGGEST TO AUTHORS THAT THESE ARE CLARIFIED IN THE RESULTS SECTION AND RELABEL THE AXIS AS RESPONSE RATE (IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS ACCORDING TO PHYSICIAN OR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF SYMPTOMS)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXACERBATION OUTCOME AMENDED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koh has a very small SD in relation to Orriols. Is this actually an SE that has been entered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TJL 19 12 02): I HAVE DOUBLE-CHECKED THE PAPER. BOTH STATISTICAL METHODS SECTION AND TEXT ACCOMPANYING GRAPH REPORT MEANS AND SDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have increased the scale for adverse events and airways responsiveness to show all the data. If responsiveness is a good outcome the axis labels need to be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Response rates showed significant effects in favour of prolonged antibiotic treatment (Peto OR (95% CI), 0.3 (0.14 to 0.63)). Conversely for exacerbation rates there was no significant difference between prolonged antibiotics and placebo (Peto OR (95% CI), 0.78 (0.28 to 2.17)). For withdrawals there was no significant difference between treatment and placebo management (Peto OR (95% CI), 1.06 (0.42 to 2.65)).Data for lung function showed no significant benefit in favour of antibiotic treatment (% predicted FEV1, WMD (95% CI) -1.05 (-6.93 to 4.83)).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have changed the dash into &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; for the CI reporting and added significant in a couple of places&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Types of outcome measures: Did you specify a primary outcome? If so it should be reported as such. If not which outcome do you think matters most (e.g. to the patient)? Is the development of antibiotic resistance an important outcome, you report some data on this and I think it should be included as an adverse effect sub-group?&lt;br&gt;Since you report Peto OR I have changed the methods to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Please check the Koh SD and I will then compare the text with the Metaview figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to authors for consideration of the above issues and putting the treatment data into the first column please.&lt;br&gt;Given to Toby 10_12_2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;10_1_03 further check by CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments appended above. Toby has checked the entry of data and labels are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie has been removed from the dichotomous exacerbation data (outcome2) as the results are medians not numbers of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Limited meta-analysis was possible due to the diversity of the trial end-points and the differing ways in which the data were presented. There was a significant treatment effect following meta-analysis for Response rates , Peto OR 3.37 (95% CI 1.60 to 7.09). For other outcomes where meta-analysis was possible, no significant effect was seen (exacerbation rates, Peto OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.27 to 3.46), lung function, WMD, -1.05 (95% CI -6.93 to 4.83) or death, Peto OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.07 to 4.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was significant heterogeneity in the number of participants experiencing exacerbations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the authors check the results after the changes that have been made and perhaps comment on the heterogeneity between Barker and the other two studies in terms of exacerbations? Also would they like to add a comment about the definitions of improvement as Toby mentions above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Types of outcome measures: Did you specify a primary outcome? If so it should be reported as such. If not which outcome do the authors think matters most (e.g. to the patient)? Is the development of antibiotic resistance an important outcome, you report some data on this and I think it should be included as an adverse effect sub-group? Since you report Peto OR I have changed the methods to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11_4_3&lt;br&gt;David could you respond to the comments from Peer Reviewer&lt;br&gt;1. &amp;quot;Tobramycin was not licensed for this indication and is still not licensed&amp;quot;. Is this correct, if so it should be mentioned in the discussion.&lt;br&gt;2. &amp;quot; Concerns about including Barker study as it is only 4 weeks&amp;quot;. Clinically where does a short course of antibiotics change to prolonged antibiotics? The protocol initially suggested that 30 weeks duration or more would be considered. Can you explain the change from protocol in the methods section and expand on the issue of duration of therapy in the discussion please? Which outcomes are better addressed by longer or shorter studies?&lt;br&gt;3. &amp;quot;Pseudomonas Aeroginosa effects prognosis - Evans Woodhead study should be referenced and discussed&amp;quot; Can you respond to this suggestion?&lt;br&gt;4. Abstract - 'Conventional treatment with physiotherapy and intermittent antibiotics does not appear to influence the natural history of the condition.' Peer reviewer suggests that there is no evidence one way or the other and has a feeling that patients who do not do physio may do worse partly because they may end up getting more antibiotics.&lt;br&gt;Also 'Various strategies have been tried to interrupt this cycle of infection and inflammation and one of these is to prolong antibiotic treatment in the hope of allowing the airway mucosa to heal.' Peer reviewer feels that the hope is for more than this (e.g. slowing progression of the disease and reducing symptoms as well). Do you wish to amend the Background para in the abstract in the light of these comments?&lt;br&gt;5. Antibiotic resistance is the main potential threat and deserves more prominence as a (missing) adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall feedback was that this was an excellent review!&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-08-09 17:32:08 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="ABI-BRO" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-23 02:52:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Does prolonged antibiotic therapy provide benefit in treatment of patients with purulent bronchiectasis?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this question important?</B>
</P>
<P>Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by abnormal dilatation of the airways. Although its global prevalence is largely unknown, available data from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and England show that bronchiectasis is now diagnosed with increasing frequency. The lungs of patients with bronchiectasis have excessive secretions, which tend to consist of different types of micro-organisms. Long-term antibiotic therapy was proposed to halt persistent and ongoing damage to the lung due to insult from micro-organisms. Therefore, we seek to assess the effects of prolonged antibiotic therapy on patients with bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>
<B>How did we answer the question?</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for all studies comparing prolonged antibiotic therapy versus usual care and/or a dummy medication (placebo).</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 18 studies including 1157 people with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis; most were adults. Twelve studies used a tablet form of antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, amoxycillin, clarithromycin, penicillin, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin). The remaining six studies reported use of inhaled medications. Antibiotics were given for between four weeks and 83 weeks. In seven studies, similar disease severity at baseline was supported by the similar history of previous hospitalisation and severe attacks.</P>
<P>Overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate. When an outcome is rated as high quality, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, but moderate ratings reflect some uncertainty in the findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Prolonged antibiotic therapy in bronchiectasis provides benefit, especially in reducing the risk of future exacerbations and hospitalisations. Antibiotics are well tolerated by participants without significant differences in overall adverse effects (e.g. intolerance, chest symptoms, fatigue, fever, palpitations).</P>
<P>However, antibiotic resistance is a matter of concern, particularly for patients with drug allergies, which further limit their future treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The vicious cycle hypothesis for bronchiectasis predicts that bacterial colonisation of the respiratory tract perpetuates inflammatory change. This damages the mucociliary escalator, preventing bacterial clearance and allowing persistence of pro-inflammatory mediators. Conventional treatment with physiotherapy and intermittent antibiotics is believed to improve the condition of people with bronchiectasis, although no conclusive data show that these interventions influence the natural history of the condition. Various strategies have been tried to interrupt this cycle of infection and inflammation, including prolonging antibiotic treatment with the goal of allowing the airway mucosa to heal.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning a total of 1157 participants. Antibiotics were given for between four weeks and 83 weeks. Limited meta-analysis was possible because of the diversity of outcomes reported in these trials. Based on the number of participants with at least one exacerbation, the meta-analysis showed significant effects in favour of the intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.52; P value &lt; 0.00001), with events occurring in 271 per 1000 people in the intervention arm (95% CI 126 to 385) and in 546 per 1000 in the control population, based on evidence of moderate quality. A non-statistically significant reduction in hospitalisation favoured the use of prolonged antibiotics with a moderate quality grade of supporting evidence (37 per 1000 in the intervention arm (95% CI 13 to 96) and 87 per 1000 in control (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.11; P value = 0.08). Drug resistance developed in 36 of 220 participants taking antibiotics compared with 10 of 211 participants given placebo or standard therapy (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.20 to 10.07; P value = 0.02), translating to natural frequencies of 155 per 1000 in the intervention arm (95% CI 59 to 346) and 50 per 1000 in the control arm. The intervention was well tolerated with no overall significant difference in withdrawal between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49). Diarrhoea was commonly reported as an adverse event, particularly with an oral intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:07:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Available evidence shows benefit associated with use of prolonged antibiotics in the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, at least halving the odds of exacerbation (with 275 fewer exacerbations per every 1000 people treated in the antibiotic arm compared with the control arm) and hospitalisation (50 fewer hospitalisations per 1000 people in the antibiotic arm compared with the control arm). However, the risk of emerging drug resistance is increased more than threefold. This review is limited by diversity of trials and by evidence of moderate to low quality. Further randomised controlled trials with adequate power and standardised end points are required.</P>

<P>Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by abnormal dilatation of the bronchial lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Loebinger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loebinger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2008</LINK>). Global prevalence of this disorder is largely unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Kwak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwak 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maguire-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 2012</LINK>), primarily because bronchiectasis may be noted as a secondary diagnosis for other conditions (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>). Formal diagnosis requires special investigation and therefore usually occurs only among patients referred to a respiratory specialist (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>). However, available data on prevalence show that bronchiectasis is now being diagnosed with increasing frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed_nez_x002d_Garc_x00ed_a-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martínez-García 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McShane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2008</LINK>). In the United States of America (USA), <LINK REF="REF-Seitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seitz 2012</LINK> found an increasing yearly prevalence from 2000 to 2007, with an annual percentage change of 8.74%. Prevalence estimates in the USA range from 4.2 per 100,000 persons 18 to 34 years of age to 271.8 per 100,000 among those 75 years of age and older (<LINK REF="REF-Weycker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weycker 2005</LINK>). In Finland, the incidence of non-CF bronchiectasis among children younger than 15 years has been estimated at 0.5 per 100,000 per year and at 3.9 per 100,000 for the overall population (<LINK REF="REF-Saynajakangas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saynajakangas 1998</LINK>). Higher prevalence estimates have been reported in children living in Northern England with 17.2 per 100,000 per year diagnosed, and in New Zealand with estimates of 3.7 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Twiss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twiss 2005</LINK>). In Australia, however, bronchiectasis among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is estimated to occur in as many as 14 per 1000 Indigenous youth (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>), with similar statistics reported when New Zealand children of Pacific and Ma&#333;ri origin were compared with children of European ancestry (<LINK REF="REF-Twiss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twiss 2005</LINK>). Statistics indicate that prevalence increases with age and peaks at around 80 years, and that higher rates have been observed among women (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seitz 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The underlying pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis is not entirely understood (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013b</LINK>). In most patients, the airways become chronically infected with a variety of pathogens involved in the aetiology of this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tunney-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunney 2013</LINK>), including <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(which dominates across all ages),<I> Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis </I>and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Grimwood-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimwood 2011</LINK>)<I>. </I>The landmark study by <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1950</LINK> first refined pathological phenotypes as cylindrical, varicose and saccular, and <LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK> further explained the evolution of bronchiectasis through the vicious cycle model. This model continues to be adapted but generally describes development of a vicious cycle of infection and inflammation whereby symptoms persist, with frequent exacerbations causing further airway damage (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2008</LINK>). Idiopathic bronchiectasis is the most common diagnosis and tends to be bilateral, cylindrical and lower lobe predominant (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013b</LINK>). Severe infections of any type can damage the bronchial wall sufficiently to induce bronchiectasis localised to the site of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013b</LINK>). The next most common aetiologies are allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, common variable immunodeficiency and primary ciliary dyskinesia (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bronchiectasis causes significant morbidity and increased risks for mortality. Typically patients will suffer with persistent cough, chronic daily sputum expectoration, recurrent chest infection and poor health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Murray-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2011</LINK>). Mortality was examined in one recent Belgium cohort analysis of 245 participants newly diagnosed between 2006 and 2012; analysis revealed increased risk of death among participants with co-morbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with participants with other bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Goeminne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goeminne 2014</LINK>). However, national statistics in Australia show that only a small number of reported deaths are directly attributable to bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>). A long-term survival study that provided 13 years of follow-up among 91 individuals with non-CF bronchiectasis in the United Kingdom found that mortality, as was reported in 29.7% of participants, was associated with a degree of restrictive and obstructive disease, poor gas transfer and chronic <I>Pseudomonas</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-Loebinger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loebinger 2009</LINK>). Additional risk factors observed to lower the likelihood of survival included increasing age and greater numbers of lobes affected (<LINK REF="REF-Goeminne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goeminne 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:09:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Recent evidence has helped improve our understanding of the role of mucus stasis in bacterial colonisation and has led to emphasis on therapies that enhance airway clearance (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2013</LINK>). Low-dose, long-term macrolide therapy has been shown to decrease exacerbation frequency and airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2013</LINK>). Long-term use of antibiotics may provide benefit by reducing exacerbations but currently is not recommended as part of routine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Valery-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valery 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2014</LINK>). However, for patients with three or more exacerbations per year requiring antibiotic therapy, or for those with fewer exacerbations causing significant morbidity, prolonged antibiotic therapy should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Pasteur-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasteur 2010</LINK>). Long-term use of inhaled antibiotics is believed to be safe and effective in reducing the sputum bacterial load, as these agents deliver a high concentration of drug to the airway along with reduced systemic absorption, thereby reducing the risk of systemic adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2013</LINK>). However, most data supporting the use of tobramycin, gentamycin and colistin compounded or re-constituted into a nebulised form for the management of bronchiectasis have come from studies on the CF population (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2013</LINK>), thus limiting the generalisability of findings to the non-CF bronchiectasis population.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:10:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Various strategies have been developed to interrupt the vicious cycle model of <LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>, whereby a repetitious syndrome of cough, sputum production and recurrent exacerbations is said to be the primary cause of bronchiectasis. If bacteria are the primary cause of airway inflammation, then according to this hypothesis, bacterial clearance through the use of short- or long-term antibiotics should reduce airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ordonez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordonez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sagel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagel 2011</LINK>). Reducing inflammation would effectively allow time for airway healing and ultimately would modify the long-term course of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2014</LINK>). One study of 49 stable participants with non-CF bronchiectasis reported a link between bacterial load and airway inflammation through bronchoalveolar lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Angrill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angrill 2001</LINK>). Another study in patients with COPD that included 43 participants with bronchiectasis also observed the correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2000</LINK>). A strong evidence base from studies of patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis supports this theory by reporting that antibiotic treatment during both stable and exacerbation periods resulted in reduced markers of inflammation. The disease pathophysiology is different; therefore direct comparison between these conditions is precarious (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:10:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To date, clinical research trials have described mixed results on the effectiveness of antibiotics for reducing airway inflammation and subsequent bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2012</LINK>). Some studies have suggested that antibiotic therapy had little or no effect on airway inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1999</LINK>), but others examining long-term use of antibiotics have revealed reduced levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase activity in sputum (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1997</LINK>), indicating reduced airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2012</LINK>). The last Cochrane review update on this topic produced some evidence to suggest a small benefit can be achieved with the use of prolonged antibiotics in the treatment of bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2007</LINK>), although recommendations were limited by a paucity of data. Since 2007, several trials using different types of antibiotic therapy have been published. Therefore, an update of the existing Cochrane review undertaken to examine newly published evidence on the role of prolonged antibiotic therapy in the management of non-CF bronchiectasis is required.</P>

<P>We included in the review a mixture of cross-over and parallel studies with the potential for unit of analysis issues to occur.

When statistics essential for analysis were missing (e.g. when group means and standard deviations for both groups were not reported) and could not be calculated from other data, we attempted to contact study authors to obtain missing data. Loss of participants that occurred before baseline measurements were obtained was assumed to have no effect on the eventual outcome data of the study.

<P>Lung function was reported in 16 studies with a total number of 990 randomly assigned participants (<LINK REF="STD-Altenburg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Altenburg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Currie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Currie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cymbala-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cymbala 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Diego-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Diego 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013a-BLESS" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013a BLESS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valery-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Valery 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yal_x00e7_in-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yalçin 2006</LINK>). Most studies reported a combination of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC); however some studies reported FEV1 alone. As lung function was variably reported, only limited data were available for meta-analysis. The only available pooled effect estimates showed no evidence of any effect for FEV1% predicted (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.10), change in FEV1 (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.70) and absolute FEV1 (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.30; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

Macrolide-resistant commensal oropharyngeal streptococci were reported to be significantly increased in the <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013a-BLESS" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013a BLESS</LINK> study with erythromycin therapy (median change 27.7%, IQR 0.04% to 41.1%) compared with placebo (median change 0.04%, IQR -1.6% to 1.5%; difference 25.5%, IQR 15.0% to 33.7%; P value &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK> study, tobramycin-resistant <I>P. aeruginosa</I> strains developed resistance in 11% of intervention participants compared with 3% of placebo participants, although this difference was not significant. Two participants developed resistance during the tobramycin period of the <LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK> study. Bacteria persisted in both participants until months two and three of the placebo period, and two additional participants had <I>P. aeruginosa</I> strains isolated during the second period of placebo treatment. The frequency and emergence of resistance did not differ significantly during the second period of placebo treatment. Other organisms were also monitored, with <I>Alcaligenes xylosoxidans</I> and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> identified in sputum cultures of two participants during the intervention treatment period, and with <I>Acinetobacter </I>spp and <I>Stenotrophomona maltophila</I> identified in two participants during the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Currie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Currie 1990</LINK> study also reported on emergence of resistance to gentamicin, which occurred with similar frequency in the two study arms (three amoxycillin and two placebo participants).

<P>In terms of absolute treatment differences, 5 of 100 people in the control group had emergent antibiotic resistance over 1.5 to 24 months, compared with 15 (95% CI 8 to 27) of 100 in the prolonged antibiotics arm (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-24 04:54:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of this review was to assess the effects of prolonged antibiotic therapy in adults and children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. We reviewed the evidence from 18 trials (1162 participants) between 1957 and 2013. Our primary outcome, exacerbation, was reported differently by 15 studies involving 925 participants and was significantly reduced by the intervention. However, the baseline exacerbation rate was adjusted (by individual study authors) in 7 (<LINK REF="STD-Altenburg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Altenburg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Diego-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Diego 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013a-BLESS" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013a BLESS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012</LINK>) out of 18 trials. Other influential factors such as <I>Pseudomonas</I> colonisation, smoking history and lobar involvement were variably reported and adjusted. All participants from five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK>) had <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> at baseline. The effect of prolonged antibiotic therapy on hospitalisation was favourable across six of seven studies with 643 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Altenburg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Altenburg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013a-BLESS" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013a BLESS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valery-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Valery 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), although results were not statistically significant. The baseline rate of hospitalisation for these studies was not described adequately, limiting the reliability of change scores from baseline. Participants included in this review were drawn from diverse populations. It does not necessarily follow that patients with differing anatomical distribution or aetiologically distinct underlying diseases or baseline characteristics will respond in a homogenous way to the same intervention. No significant effect on mortality, exercise capacity, lung function or quality of life was reported. However, follow-up plans of the included studies ranging from 4 to 96 weeks suggest that the effect on mortality may not be conclusive.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:16:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Despite an extensive literature search and relatively high burden of disease in the community, only 18 studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. The primary aim of this review was to address the possible benefit of prolonged antibiotic therapy for individuals with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>The trials were of differing duration. We arbitrarily chose a cutoff of four weeks of treatment for eligibility because this duration was longer than the standard 7 to 10 day course of treatment traditionally provided for uncomplicated exacerbations. Furthermore, long-term use of antibiotics was defined as use of this treatment with a prophylactic intent in patients at a chronic stable phase (i.e. not for exacerbations). The studies reported by <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK> (four weeks), <LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK> (four weeks), <LINK REF="STD-De-Diego-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Diego 2013</LINK> (12 weeks), <LINK REF="STD-Koh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 1997</LINK> (12 weeks) and <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1999</LINK> (eight weeks) were probably too brief to allow firm conclusions about disease-modifying effects.</P>
<P>Inclusion of six trials using inhaled antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2013a</LINK>) is also worthy of consideration. The mechanism of action of inhaled antibiotics may differ from that of antibiotics given by the oral route; however, increased withdrawals due to severe adverse events or intolerable effects were noted in both study arms when compared with oral interventions.</P>
<P>In conclusion, 15 trials in this review demonstrate a trend supporting use of prolonged antibiotics in the management of bronchiectasis with significant risk of emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, appropriate patient selection is essential. The intervention was safe and tolerated by study participants, particularly when the oral route was used. Trials exhibited significant shortcomings, particularly in terms of study duration, baseline exacerbation, hospitalisation and bacterial colonisation/isolation, hence further research is required. These new studies should incorporate methods allowing separate study of specific issues such as <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> colonisation and drug resistance at individual and community levels.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:16:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The overall quality of studies included in this review was moderate. Most included studies reported that they blinded assessors and participants from allocation; however not enough information was provided for this assessment. In addition, information was insufficient to assess attrition bias, especially with reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cymbala-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cymbala 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drobnic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drobnic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1957" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yal_x00e7_in-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yalçin 2006</LINK>). Small sample sizes further limited the ability of study authors to draw reliable conclusions regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety.</P>
<P>Attempts to outline a mechanism for clinical effects (other than sputum volume, purulence, cultures and resistance patterns) were limited to the studies reported by <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK>. In the former investigation, no change was seen in sputum cytokines or leukotrienes despite improvements in lung function and sputum volume. <LINK REF="STD-Orriols-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Orriols 1999</LINK> showed a reduction in airway responsiveness and suggested that this might have occurred through indirect effects on airway inflammation.</P>
<P>In general, the trials suggest that long-term antibiotics in bronchiectasis are an effective intervention for reducing sputum volume and purulence, but they have a very limited impact on the natural history of the condition. However, several important issues related to this review weaken the power of review authors to draw final conclusions; these will be addressed in turn.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:16:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>No significant biases were anticipated or were found to occur during the review process. Criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> were strictly followed to limit the potential for bias during screening, data extraction and analyses of included studies. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors (KH and CN), who resolved conflicts by discussion with a third review author (KVC). We contacted the corresponding author of two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Altenburg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Altenburg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013a-BLESS" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013a BLESS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serisier-2013b-ORBIT" TYPE="STUDY">Serisier 2013b ORBIT</LINK>) and the authors of the three initially unclassified citations to ask for raw data and clarification of methodological techniques. The review authors of this meta-analysis have reported no conflicts of interest.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-24 09:35:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Emergence of drug resistance was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Barker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 2000</LINK> and was repeatedly reproduced by newer studies with follow-up longer than six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Widespread use of antibiotics poses a high likelihood of inducing substantial population-level antibiotic resistance in a range of micro-organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Serisier-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serisier 2014</LINK>). In particular, the long-acting agent azithromycin rapidly induces sustained macrolide resistance, and its introduction in the USA in 1992 was temporally associated with a substantial increase in rates of macrolide resistance in pneumococcal isolates (<LINK REF="REF-Serisier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serisier 2013</LINK>). This review was limited to emergence of drug resistance among participants; however, available evidence from this review supports the imperative importance of patient selection for intervention, especially with long-acting antibiotics. The process of patient selection can be assisted by the bronchiectasis severity index (BSI), which is based on prior hospital admission(s), Medical Research Council dyspnoea score greater than or equal to 4, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 30% predicted, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> colonisation, colonisation with other pathogenic organisms and three or more lobes involved as seen on high-resolution computed tomography (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2013</LINK>), which was validated across five cohorts (1310 participants) with four-year follow-up. Similar clinical domains were based on another score called "FACED" (F for forced expiratory volume in one second; A for Age; C for <I>Pseudomonas</I> colonisation; E for extent of bronchiectasis counting lobar involvement on CT scan; and D for dyspnoea, using the Medical Research Council dyspnoea score proposed by Martinez-Garcia et al, with an intent to predict five-year mortality in mild, moderate and severe disease (defined as scores of 0 to 2, 3 to 4 and 5 to 7, respectively) of 4%, 25% and 56%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Garcia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Garcia 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saleh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saleh 2014</LINK>). Moreover, the development of multi-drug-resistant organisms among patients with drug allergy will add extra burden. Therefore, in clinical practice, conscientious selection of an appropriate intervention for each patient is of utmost importance.</P>
<P>Another recent review of long-term macrolides for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis found that macrolides were a reliable treatment option for individuals with stable bronchiectasis, as revealed by available data (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2014</LINK>). However, similar to our review, for outcomes such as macrolide resistance, meta-analysis of all included studies was not possible because outcome data were incompletely reported. Authors of the <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2014</LINK> review conclude that their results justify further investigation of macrolides in combination with usual treatment regimens for bronchiectasis.</P>

<P>Further trials are required to examine this question in relation to issues surrounding the management of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> colonisation, which should be addressed separately, as should the question of route of administration. A non-antibacterial effect of macrolide antibiotics should also be sought. Possible adverse effects intervention based on route of administration of the intervention, particularly patient tolerance, should be monitored in future studies. These new trials should be appropriately powered and of adequate duration. They should have standardised endpoints and should report baseline characteristics of participants, particularly extent of disease (lung function, radiological extent/lobes involved), disease burden (baseline exacerbation, hospitalisation, sputum volume and purulence), smoking status and co-morbidities.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:18:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The presence of clinical heterogeneity between treatments used in this review precluded the assumption of a fixed-effect model (with a single treatment effect for all studies). As such, the primary analyses were changed to a random-effects model, with a fixed-effect model included as a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>The small number of paediatric studies and the presence of high heterogeneity between them led to the decision that pre-specified subgroup analyses for paediatric versus adult populations would not be performed.</P>
<P>The order of the outcomes was changed. Acute exacerbations and hospitalisations was added as a primary outcome. Methods were updated to the latest Cochrane methodological expectations, and a 'Summary of findings' table, a 'Characteristics of included studies' table and a table reporting types of interventions and status of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> were added.</P>
