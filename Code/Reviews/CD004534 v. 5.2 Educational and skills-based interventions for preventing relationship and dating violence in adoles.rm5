<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Relationship and dating violence is a significant problem among adolescents and young adults. Relationship violence includes a range of violent behaviours, from verbal abuse to physical and sexual assault, and from threats to rape and murder. Currently there are many programmes in schools and universities and within community settings that aim to prevent relationship violence. It is important to establish whether these programmes work and whether they result in long-term reductions in relationship violence. This review looked at the results of 38 studies. The results showed no convincing evidence that the programmes decreased relationship violence, or that they improved participants' attitudes, behaviours and skills related to relationship violence. The results showed that participants' knowledge about relationships improved slightly following the programmes. These results should be interpreted with caution, as individual studies differed in the types of participants and interventions that they used and the ways in which changes were measured. None of the studies looked at the effect of the programmes on physical and mental health. Further studies, which follow participants for a longer period of time and which look at the relationship between attitudes, knowledge, behaviour, skills and the number of times relationship violence occurs, are required to improve our understanding of how well these programmes work.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, six other databases and a trials register on 7 May 2012. We handsearched the references lists of key articles and two journals (<I>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</I> and <I>Child Abuse and Neglect</I>). We also contacted researchers in the field.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias. For each study included in the meta-analysis, data were extracted independently by GF and one other review author (either CH, JN, SH or DS). We conducted meta-analyses for the following outcomes: episodes of relationship violence, behaviours, attitudes, knowledge and skills.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 38 studies (15,903 participants) in this review, 18 of which were cluster-randomised trials (11,995 participants) and two were quasi-randomised trials (399 participants). We included 33 studies in the meta-analyses. We included eight studies (3405 participants) in the meta-analysis assessing episodes of relationship violence. There was substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 57%) for this outcome. The risk ratio was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.13). We included 22 studies (5256 participants) in the meta-analysis assessing attitudes towards relationship violence. The standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.06 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.15). We included four studies (887 participants) in the meta-analysis assessing behaviour related to relationship violence; the SMD was -0.07 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.16). We included 10 studies (6206 participants) in the meta-analysis assessing knowledge related to relationship violence; the results showed an increase in knowledge in favour of the intervention (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60) but there was substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 52%). We included seven studies (1369 participants) in the meta-analysis assessing skills related to relationship violence. The SMD was 0.03 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.17). None of the included studies assessed physical health, psychosocial health or adverse outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant differences by intervention setting or type of participants. The quality of evidence for all outcomes included in our meta-analysis was moderate due to an unclear risk of selection and detection bias and a high risk of performance bias in most studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies included in this review showed no evidence of effectiveness of interventions on episodes of relationship violence or on attitudes, behaviours and skills related to relationship violence. We found a small increase in knowledge but there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity among studies. Further studies with longer-term follow-up are required, and study authors should use standardised and validated measurement instruments to maximise comparability of results.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term 'intimate partner violence' describes actual or threatened physical, sexual or psychological violence that occurs within a relationship or is perpetrated by a current or former partner or spouse (<LINK REF="REF-Saltzman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saltzman 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Saltzman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saltzman 2002</LINK> further defines the components of intimate partner violence as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>physical violence is the intentional use of physical force with the potential for causing death, disability, injury or harm;</LI>
<LI>sexual violence is divided into three categories:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the use of physical force to compel a person to engage in a sexual act against his or her will, whether or not the act is completed,</LI>
<LI>attempted or completed sex act involving a person who is unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, to decline participation, or to communicate unwillingness to engage in the sexual act, for example because of illness, disability, or the influence of alcohols or other drugs, or because of intimidation or pressure,</LI>
<LI>abusive sexual contact;</LI>
</UL>
<LI>threats of physical or sexual violence involves the use of words, gestures or weapons to communicate the intent to cause death, disability, injury or physical harm;</LI>
<LI>psychological/emotional violence involves trauma to the victim caused by acts, threats of acts or coercive tactics.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Physical, sexual and verbal violence can be common responses to conflict within relationships and can have significant effects upon the mental, physical and social well-being of those involved. Although intimate partner violence is often unreported, prevalence within the adult population is estimated to be high, with prevalence rates varying between countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). For example, one multi-country study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that between 3% and 54% of women report having experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the previous year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). In addition, between 10% and 50% of women report having experienced violence from partners or ex-partners at some point in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rates of relationship abuse vary according to age, sex and previous experience of violence (<LINK REF="REF-Foshee-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foshee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foshee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Archer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2000</LINK>). The prevalence of relationship violence is higher in adolescents than in adults, with females aged 12 to 18 years having the highest victimisation rate (<LINK REF="REF-Home-Office-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Home Office 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>). This form of violence is called dating violence and perpetrators are most likely to be peers (<LINK REF="REF-Schewe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schewe 2006</LINK>). Approximately 20% of young women have experienced violence from a dating partner (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Keeffe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Keeffe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1992</LINK>). Additionally, studies on relationship violence have found that first episodes of violence frequently occur in adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Henton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henton 1983</LINK>). In younger dating samples, relatively higher proportions of aggression by women against men have been described, although results vary according to the measurement methods used and must, therefore, be interpreted with caution (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early experiences of dating violence are linked to poor health outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Exner_x002d_Cortens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Exner-Cortens 2013</LINK>), teenage pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>), substance misuse (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyler-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyler 2012</LINK>), cancer, coronary heart disease, attempted suicide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Exner_x002d_Cortens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Exner-Cortens 2013</LINK>), depression (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolitzky_x002d_Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolitzky-Taylor 2008</LINK>), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolitzky_x002d_Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolitzky-Taylor 2008</LINK>). Relationship violence during pregnancy is also associated with adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes including preterm delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>), low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>), and foetal death (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>). Moreover, adolescents who have experienced dating violence in the past are more likely to be perpetrators or victims of intimate partner violence as adults (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiodo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiodo 2012</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focuses on educational and skills-based interventions targeted at young people aged 12 to 25 years. It includes primary preventive interventions, where participants may have never experienced or perpetrated relationship violence, and secondary prevention, where participants have experienced or perpetrated relationship violence in the past. This review focuses only upon interventions that actively provide the participants with knowledge and skills aimed at preventing initial or further relationship violence. It does not include 'screening programmes' that only offer referral to support agencies. We selected the age group 12 to 25 years to include both adolescents and young adults.</P>
<P>A number of environments can be used to deliver educational and skills-based interventions, including the community, and in particular, within schools and higher education environments (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1999</LINK>). Because schools play an important role in the development of social behaviour, they provide an appropriate environment to target children and adolescents in the prevention of dating violence and subsequently other forms of relationship violence. Previous systematic reviews have focused on the effectiveness of general violence prevention programmes, such as those against aggression and bullying (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park_x002d_Higgerson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park-Higgerson 2008</LINK>). However, there is further potential to utilise schools and other settings in preventing relationship violence. Studies from the USA suggest that interventions delivered to college-based populations may have an effect on reducing incidences of sexual assault and possibly intimate partner violence (<LINK REF="REF-Luthra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luthra 2006</LINK>). Programmes can also be delivered within home (<LINK REF="STD-Foshee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 2012</LINK>) and community (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK>) settings to raise awareness about abuse, promote positive relationships, enable help-seeking and peer support, challenge discriminative viewpoints and encourage the development of protective skills (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1999</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Educational and skills-based programmes aiming to prevent or reduce dating and relationship violence may provide participants with the skills to communicate effectively; deal constructively with stress, disappointment and rejection; resolve conflicts and promote healthier relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1999</LINK>). They may also provide young people with skills to protect themselves from the risk of relationship violence and to improve low self-esteem, which is linked to the likelihood of being a victim of relationship violence (<LINK REF="STD-Gidycz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gidycz 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The high prevalence of relationship violence and the severity and duration of its health consequences render this area an important public health issue. To date, many review studies have focused either on intimate partner violence or domestic violence in adult populations (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2010</LINK>), or on the prevention of sexual abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2009</LINK>), or general violence (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>), in children. We have found only one systematic review of interventions to prevent dating and relationship violence in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Whitaker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitaker 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Whitaker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitaker 2006</LINK>, which reviewed only primary prevention programmes, included non-randomised (e.g. pre- and postinterventions) as well as randomised studies, and summarised results narratively. Our review builds upon these findings by limiting included studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, including primary and secondary prevention programmes, and summarising results in a meta-analysis. Given that interventions to prevent relationship violence based in schools and universities are becoming increasingly widespread, this review is important for strengthening the evidence base, providing a clearer idea of what works, and helping to inform future policy, practice and research in this area.</P>

<P>Two review authors (GF and CH) independently screened the titles and abstracts of articles identified in the search against the inclusion criteria and decided which reports should be retrieved. We rejected articles at this stage if the title or abstract did not focus on prevention of relationship and dating violence in adolescents or young adults. If there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to make such decisions, we retrieved the full text. When the full text was not readily available or when we needed further clarification to establish eligibility for our review, we contacted the authors by email. If this was unsuccessful, we contacted host universities in the case of doctoral theses, requested interlibrary loans and sought the help of the Cochrane Group Trials Search Co-ordinator and a local librarian.</P>
<P>We reviewed selection decisions and resolved disagreements by consultation with a third review author. If disagreements were not resolved in conjunction with the third review author, we consulted the CDPLPG editor.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-05-24 23:23:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the cluster-RCTs included in this review, we followed the guidance on statistical methods for such trials outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.3). We planned to use a summary measure of effect from an analysis that adequately accounted for the cluster design. If this was not available, we planned to extract or calculate appropriate measures of effect as for a parallel group trial and adjust the standard errors (SE) to account for the effect of clustering. We used an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to describe the relative variability in outcomes within and between clusters. Among our included cluster-RCTs, only one used an ICC<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>).<I> </I>The ICC used in this study was 0.02, which we felt was insufficiently conservative based on meta-analyses of other similar subjects. Thus, for our analyses, we adopted a higher ICC of 0.15, based on two similar reviews: first, a review of school-based programmes to prevent violence that used ICC values of 0.1 and 0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>) and second, a meta-analysis of multi-component preventive interventions for children at risk of antisocial behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-CPPRG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPPRG 1999</LINK>), which used an ICC value of 0.15. We used the ICC to calculate a design effect for each cluster-RCT. In the meta-analyses, we calculated SMD effect sizes. These were weighted using the generic inverse variance function, and we used random-effects assumptions.</P>
<P>Several studies identified for inclusion in the review had multiple intervention groups. In these cases, to avoid double counting and creating unit-of-analysis errors, we made single pair-wise comparisons. In other words, we combined all relevant intervention groups (i.e. educational and skills-based interventions aiming to prevent relationship or dating violence) into a single group, and all relevant control groups into a single group. We then made comparisons between the combined intervention group and the combined control group. For dichotomous outcomes, we summed the sample sizes and number of outcomes across groups. For continuous outcomes, we combined means and standard deviations (SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.5.4). If this would have limited the investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity, we planned to compare each intervention group separately against a proportion of the common control group such that no double-counting of individuals in the common control group occurred. We carried out these analyses using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-05-24 23:23:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If significant quantities of participant data were missing and the review authors agreed that a study's conclusions were compromised as a result, we contacted trial authors and asked them to supply missing data (e.g. on subgroup means and SDs, numbers of participants). If we received no reply or if missing data were not available, we excluded studies from the final analysis. We also asked trial authors for ICC values. For each study included in our review, we report the dropout rate (calculated as the number of participants included in the final analysis as a proportion of those who began the intervention) in the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>We considered conducting an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomised participants using imputed values for the missing data but maintained that the size of the missing data was too problematic to impute values. Instead, we excluded participants for whom no outcome data were available (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This re-introduces bias previously removed by the randomisation process. We discuss the extent to which the results and conclusions of the review are altered by the missing data.</P>

<P>For the meta-analyses involving 10 or more studies, we produced funnel plots (estimating differences in treatment effects against their SE) to assess the presence of possible publication bias. We assessed these visually, followed by exploratory analyses to investigate possible causes, for example comparison of fixed-effect and random-effects estimates. While funnel plot asymmetry may indicate publication bias, this is not inevitably the case, and we consider possible explanations for any asymmetry found in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-05-30 13:01:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To make best use of the data, we combined studies in meta-analysis across all settings and irrespective of duration or intensity. These aspects were explored in subgroup analysis and no differential effect was found. Where there was substantial heterogeneity, we computed pooled estimates only for those trials that could be analysed together and for which the necessary statistical data were available. In our protocol we agreed that if substantial heterogeneity was indicated (i.e. greater than 50%), we would exclude studies from meta-analysis and report results narratively. However, for two of our outcomes we went ahead with meta-analysis despite heterogeneity being greater than 50%. This decision was based on a number of reasons: firstly, a pooled result was still deemed to be useful despite high heterogeneity, particularly for the main outcome of episodes of relationship and dating violence; secondly, much of the heterogeneity was due to one or two small, outlying studies; and thirdly, heterogeneity was only marginally above our threshold (57% for episodes of relationship and dating violence and 52% for knowledge of relationship and dating violence). We describe our reasons in more detail under <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>&gt;<I>Primary outcomes</I>&gt;<I>Episodes of relationship and dating violence</I> and <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>&gt;<I>Secondary outcomes</I>&gt;<I>Knowledge of relationship and dating violence</I>. We discuss the implications of conducting meta-analyses on studies with a high degree of heterogeneity in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>
<P>We conducted analyses according to outcome (e.g. episodes of relationship and dating violence, attitudes towards dating and relationship violence, skills associated with dating and relationship violence). Within each outcome, we created subgroups according to the measurement instrument used to assess the outcome. We adjusted scales where necessary so that high scores across all scales would signify either an improvement or deterioration.</P>
<P>We carried out data synthesis using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). As per our protocol, we used a random-effects model where there was no severe funnel plot asymmetry. Random-effects analysis assumes that the treatment effect differs between studies, while fixed-effect analysis assumes that the studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect. Given that we were examining educational and skills-based interventions for preventing relationship and dating violence in both adolescents and young adults, it was likely that the review would be combining data from trials with differences in design, population and interventions, thus resulting in different effects. This made the use of a random-effects analysis more appropriate. However, where studies had similar interventions measuring the same outcomes, we used a fixed-effect analysis. Where there was significant funnel plot asymmetry, we used both fixed-effect and random-effects models and reported the degree of agreement between the results of the two models. We calculated overall effects using the inverse variance method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated an overall RR. We calculated MDs for continuous outcomes and similar comparisons and outcome measures and SMDs for continuous outcomes measured with similar, but not identical, instruments across studies. For ease of interpretation, where possible, we expressed results as a RR (or odds ratios (OR)) and included 95% confidence intervals (CI). We described studies in which the combining of data in a meta-analysis was inappropriate due to substantial heterogeneity (as defined above) individually.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Most interventions were aimed at general audiences rather than targeted at individuals at high risk of experiencing or committing relationship violence. Five studies targeted high-risk individuals such as adjudicated adolescent males (<LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK>), individuals or couples known to be at high risk of dating aggression (<LINK REF="STD-Schewe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schewe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Woodin 2010</LINK>), and individuals with a history of maltreatment and therefore at risk of relationship violence (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Interventions were predominantly educational, although five provided an additional component on self defence (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gidycz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gidycz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orchowski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Orchowski 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florsheim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Florsheim 2011</LINK>) and one provided a component on communication skills (<LINK REF="STD-Macgowan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Macgowan 1997</LINK>). The duration of interventions ranged from a single, 50-minute session to 18 sessions delivered over four months (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>). In the majority of studies, the control group received either no intervention or standard care, or were 'wait list controls' (i.e. receiving the intervention after completion of data collection). A number of studies provided the control groups with placebo interventions, which generally took the same format as the intervention but with different and unrelated content, such as presentations, videos or plays on career development (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>), multi-cultural issues (<LINK REF="STD-Lanier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 1998</LINK>), sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="STD-Pinzone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pinzone 1998</LINK>), stress management (<LINK REF="STD-Saberi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Saberi 1999</LINK>) and other similar issues (<LINK REF="STD-Yom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yom 2005</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Of the outcomes we listed, the included studies reported one primary outcome (episodes of relationship or dating violence) and three secondary outcomes (improvements in behaviour or knowledge, improvement in access, and attainment of protective skills). Included studies did not report injuries, mental well-being, adverse events and intervention-related factors.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies reported episodes of relationship or dating violence. Of these, eight used the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES), five used the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and the remaining four used other scales. Eight studies had sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Of our secondary outcomes, the majority of studies included in our review assessed improvements in behaviour, knowledge and skills related to dating and relationship violence. Several studies included measures of changes in attitudes, and we included this outcome in our results even though we did not stated it separately in our predefined outcomes because we had assumed this to be a subcomponent of behaviour and knowledge. Sixteen studies assessed attitude changes; the scale used most frequently was the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1980</LINK>) and variations thereof (a shortened or modified form of the RMAS; Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance; Rape Myth Scale). Other scales used to assess attitudes included the Rape Empathy Scale, the Date Rape Attitudes Survey, the Relationship Expectations Scale and the General Attitudes Towards Rape scale. Six studies assessed behaviour change, of which three used the Dating Behaviour Survey to measure outcomes. Twelve studies assessed the change in knowledge following the intervention. Many studies used their own measurement tools, often using multiple-choice questions, to assess participants' knowledge. Finally, seven studies assessed improved skills to prevent relationship and dating violence, of which five used the Sexual Communication Survey (SCS) to measure changes in participants' ability to communicate effectively with dating partners.</P>
<P>Individual studies measured outcomes at different timepoints. Thirty studies assessed short-term outcomes (0-6 months following intervention); four studies assessed medium-term outcomes (6-12 months following intervention); and four studies assessed long-term outcomes (more than 12 months following intervention). Because such a significant majority of studies assessed short-term outcomes, we analysed all studies together and conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether effects differed when medium-term, long-term, or both, were excluded from the analyses. If a study had multiple follow-up points, we chose the longest duration of follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the interventions evaluated in these trials made blinding of participants and personnel delivering the interventions virtually impossible. Interventions were delivered by study authors, established teaching staff in the institutions being studied or members of a third-party organisation specialising in the delivery of such interventions (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>). Most studies provided training (to varying degrees) for the personnel delivering the interventions. Of these, some described ways of minimising the potential for performance bias, such as providing personnel with a script or detailed guidance to follow. However, only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gidycz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gidycz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaycox-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jaycox 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orchowski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Orchowski 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gidycz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gidycz 2011</LINK>) described monitoring performance objectively through methods such as observation or recording the interventions being delivered to ensure adherence to the study protocol.

<P>The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of educational and skills-based interventions designed to prevent relationship and dating violence in adolescents and young adults. We included 38 studies in the review, of which we included 33 in the meta-analyses. We excluded five studies from the meta-analyses: <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1992</LINK> was excluded because results were analysed using non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) analyses; <LINK REF="STD-Foshee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 1998</LINK> did not report the number of participants in each arm or any tests of significance; <LINK REF="STD-Shultz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 2000</LINK> did not report the number of participants in each group; and <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Woodin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Woodin 2010</LINK> reported F-statistics, which could not be used to extract evidence of effect as the statistic was not associated to a direct comparison of the intervention under study (and therefore not equivalent to a t-test).</P>
<P>Where a study used more than one scale to measure a particular outcome, we included the scale that was most widely used across other studies and the most validated, such as the RMAS (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1980</LINK>) and the SES (<LINK REF="REF-Koss-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koss 1982</LINK>). If a study measured more than one outcome (e.g. episodes of dating violence and change in attitudes towards dating violence), we included all outcomes but ensured each outcome was included in a separate meta-analysis. If studies had more than one follow-up period, we selected the longest period of follow-up (up to one year) for inclusion in our meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We applied an ICC value of 0.15 to results of all cluster-RCTs with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>, in which the authors had already accounted for the effect of clustering using two-level hierarchical models.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Episodes of relationship and dating violence</HEADING>
<P>Seventeen studies measured episodes of relationship and dating violence. We conducted analysis as two separate meta-analyses: one of categorical data and one of continuous data.</P>
<P>The analysis of categorical data included eight studies (3405 participants), of which seven used the SES. The remaining study assessed the number of students experiencing physical dating violence only (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>). Within this analysis, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 57%). The high Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (16.35; degrees of freedom = 7) and low P value (0.02) provide further evidence of variation of effect estimates beyond chance. Despite this, we felt it important to conduct a meta-analysis because episodes of relationship and dating violence was our most important outcome, because this was the only outcome for which all included studies except one used the same measurement scale and because the I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 57% was only marginally above our originally defined threshold of 50%. Indeed, the level of heterogeneity between studies, as shown by the forest plot, suggests that pooling results is unlikely to be problematic and that much of the heterogeneity may be the influence of two outlying studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gidycz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gidycz 2011</LINK>). Using a random-effects model, the RR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.13). The RR suggests a 23% reduction in the episodes of relationship violence experienced by participants receiving the intervention, but the CI does not exclude the possibility that the interventions had no effect or were associated with an increase in episodes of violence experienced. (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.)</P>
<P>The second analysis for this outcome was conducted on the five studies (3171 participants) that assessed the occurrence of relationship and dating violence using continuous scoring systems such as the Interpersonal Violence Scale (IPV), the Revised CTS2 and the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI). <LINK REF="STD-Foubert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foubert 2000</LINK> used the SES but presented results as mean scores and was therefore included in this second analysis rather than the first analysis. Within this second analysis, there was no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and a fixed-effect model was used. The SMD was -0.05 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.09). Although the point estimate suggests a mean 0.05-point reduction in relationship violence experienced by those exposed to the interventions, the CI includes the possibility of the intervention having no effect or even increasing participants' experiences of violence as compared to the control group.

<P>The meta-analysis for attitudes towards relationship and dating violence included 22 studies. Thirteen of these studies used the RMAS to measure outcomes and nine used other scales. A total of 5256 participants were included. There was evidence of moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 48%). Using a fixed-effect model, the SMD was 0.06 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.15). Because of the moderate level of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was also conducted, which produced an SMD of 0.08 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.22). Point estimates from both the random-effects and fixed-effect models suggest slightly improved (i.e. less accepting) attitudes towards relationship violence in participants receiving the intervention. However, CIs from both models include the possibility of the interventions having no effect or even worsening participants' attitudes towards relationship violence. (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behaviour in relationship and dating violence</HEADING>
<P>We included four studies (887 participants) in the meta-analysis for behaviour in relationships and dating violence. Three studies used the Dating Behaviour Survey and one study used the Behavioural Intent to Rape Survey. There was no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and, therefore, we used a fixed-effect model. The SMD was -0.07 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.16). The point estimate of -0.07 suggests a slight deterioration in behaviour towards relationship violence among those exposed to the intervention. However, the CI cannot rule out the possibility of the intervention having no effect or having a beneficial effect on behaviours. (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Knowledge of relationship and dating violence</HEADING>
<P>We included 10 studies (6206 participants) in the meta-analysis for knowledge of relationship and dating violence. Each study used different scales to measure participants' knowledge. <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK> measured students' knowledge using the Seventh Grade Inventory of Knowledge and Attitudes. The authors did not state the direction of the scoring in their scale. The other nine studies included in the meta-analysis of knowledge change had scales in which a higher score indicated better knowledge, and we assumed this rule to apply to the Inventory used by <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK>. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>of 52% for this outcome suggests that there may be substantial heterogeneity. The high Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (18.81; degrees of freedom 9) and low P value (0.03) provide further evidence of variation of effect estimates beyond chance. This heterogeneity is likely to be the result of the differences in scales used to assess knowledge (nine different scales used in 10 studies). As with our first outcome measure, we proceeded with meta-analysis despite the I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 52% being above our threshold. We present results here and discuss the implications of the high level of heterogeneity in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>. Using a random-effects model, the SMD was 0.44 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.60), suggesting a mean increase in knowledge of 0.44 as assessed by these scales.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Skills related to relationship and dating violence</HEADING>
<P>We included seven studies (1369 participants) in the meta-analysis for skills related to relationship and dating violence. Of these, five used the SCS to assess outcomes, one (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>) used the Adolescent Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire and one (<LINK REF="STD-Foubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foubert 1998</LINK>) used the Behavioural Intent to Rape Survey. All of these scales assessed respondents' abilities to communicate effectively. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>was low at 0%, with a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 5.26 (degrees of freedom 6) and a non-significant P value (0.51). Although the I<SUP>2</SUP> suggests low heterogeneity, care must be taken when assessing Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests on a meta-analysis of a small number of studies, as the test has low power. A non-significant result should, therefore, not be interpreted as evidence of no heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Using a fixed-effect model, the SMD was 0.03 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.17). The point estimate suggests slight improvement in skills following exposure to the intervention but the CI does not exclude the possibility of the intervention having no effect or causing a deterioration in skills.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis for each outcome was re-run to assess whether there was any effect of the delivery setting or type of audience (general or high-risk). Tests for subgroup differences used random-effects models due to the risk of false-positive results when comparing subgroups in a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We summarise subgroup differences in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. For delivery setting, there was a statistically significant difference in subgroups when university-based interventions were compared with community- and school-based interventions for the outcome of knowledge of relationship violence (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 6.27, P value = 0.01; see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). For all other outcomes, we found no significant differences when analyses were conducted separately for the three possible intervention settings. For audience type, we found significant subgroup differences between interventions aimed at general audiences and those aimed at high-risk audiences in the episodes of relationship violence experienced (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) and attitudes towards relationship violence (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The decision to conduct subgroup analyses by audience type was made post-hoc upon finding that a number of included studies targeted their interventions specifically at individuals deemed to be at high risk of experiencing relationship violence, and who might differ systematically from general (lower risk) audiences. To assess whether the timing of outcome assessment affected results, we conducted subgroup analyses in which studies assessing medium-term outcomes, long-term outcomes or both were excluded. Exclusion of these studies made no significant difference to pooled results across any of the outcomes. </P>
<P>To assess whether the duration of the intervention affected results, we ran two subgroup analyses. In the first subgroup analysis for duration of intervention, we categorised studies into three groups according to total contact time (&#8805;1 hour; 1-5 hours; &#8805;5 hours). In the second subgroup analysis for duration of intervention, we categorised studies into three groups according to total number of sessions (1 session; 2-5 sessions; &gt;5 sessions). For the first, 13 studies were excluded from subgroup analysis as the duration of each session was unclear. For the second, 5 studies were excluded from subgroup analysis as the total number of sessions was unclear.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>As assessment bias and attrition bias was deemed to be low in the majority of studies (37 and 30 studies, respectively), we did not run sensitivity analyses to assess the extent to which results were sensitive to the analysis being restricted to only those studies judged to be at a low risk of bias in these areas. Selection bias, as assessed by random sequence generation, was considered to be low in only six studies. Limiting the analysis to those studies at low risk of selection bias made no significant difference to the pooled result for the episodes of relationship violence experienced, attitudes towards relationship violence or behaviour towards relationship violence. In the analysis of knowledge about relationship violence, only one study was at low risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2012</LINK>). The individual results of <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2012</LINK> showed an SMD of -0.01 (95% CI -0.40 to 0.38), compatible with either an increase or decrease in knowledge for the intervention group, compared to the pooled result of 0.43 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.61), which suggested an increase in knowledge for the intervention group. We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of including quasi-RCTs, which are at high risk of allocation bias. Excluding quasi-RCTs from the analysis made no significant difference to the pooled result for any of the outcomes assessed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies not included in meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>Five studies included in our review did not contribute to the meta-analysis. In these studies only summary statistics (such as F-tests not equivalent to t-tests), non-parametric tests, or lack of information on the numbers of participants, means and SDs in each group were available. One study excluded from the meta-analysis was the 'Safe Dates' study by Foshee et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foshee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 1998</LINK>). This was a large cluster-RCT involving 1886 students aged 11 to 17 years from 14 schools in North Carolina, USA. The intervention group received 10 sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, addressing dating violence at school, as well as community workshops within emergency departments and social services. Follow-up was conducted one month, one year and four years following the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Foshee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 1998</LINK>). At one month, there was 25% less psychological abuse perpetration (P value &lt; 0.05); 60% less physical violence perpetration (P value &lt; 0.05) and 60% less sexual violence perpetration (P value &lt; 0.10). At one year, there was no significant difference in behaviour. At four years, there was a significant reduction in the perpetration of physical (P value &lt; 0.02) and sexual (P value = 0.04) dating violence, and less victimisation of physical (P value &lt; 0.05) and sexual (P value = 0.01) dating violence. A four-year booster intervention made no further improvements to the original intervention. The fact that results of this important study could not be included in our meta-analysis (due to insufficient raw data provided in results) is a significant limitation of our results.</P>
<P>We excluded four other studies from our meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1992</LINK> was a cluster-RCT in which athletic organisations at a university received a prevention programme aimed at increasing awareness of acquaintance rape and creating a safer college experience. There was a statistically significant greater increase in scores in one intervention group compared to control (U = 196.5, z = -3.06, P value &lt; 0.05), but no statistically significant difference in scores between a second intervention group compared to control (U = 117, z = -0.87, P value &gt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 2002</LINK> was a cluster-RCT of freshman athletes who received a gender date rape prevention programme consisting of case scenarios and discussions lasting 50 minutes. Following the prevention programme, the intervention group showed significantly more disapproving attitudes towards date rape than the control group (F(1,35) = 47.089, P value = 0.0001). <LINK REF="STD-Shultz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 2000</LINK> was a small RCT of university students who participated in an interactive drama programme on the topic of date rape. Results showed statistically significant differences in post-test scores between the control (mean 74.25) and intervention groups (means 83.18 and 81.73 for pre-tested and unpre-tested groups, respectively) (P value &lt; 0.0002), suggesting that the programme successfully improved students' attitudes. <LINK REF="STD-Woodin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Woodin 2010</LINK> was an RCT involving 50 university dating couples who reported at least one episode of physical aggression in their current relationship. Couples attended an interview and received motivational feedback individually as well as in couples. There was a significant overall reduction in physical aggression perpetration (effect size d = 0.58, P value &lt; 0.05) among participants in the intervention group, and the intervention group also reduced physical aggression at a significantly greater rate than participants in the control group (d = 0.56, P value &lt; 0.05).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 22:45:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of interventions to prevent relationship and dating violence can be quantified by a number of different outcomes. We assessed the effectiveness of these interventions as measured by changes in the number of episodes of relationship violence, changes in behaviours, attitudes and knowledge, and protective skills attained. For all outcomes apart from knowledge change, our meta-analyses show no evidence of a statistically significant effect. In the meta-analysis for knowledge of relationship violence, interventions appeared to have a beneficial effect. However, there was substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 57%) between these studies, which is likely to be due to the variation between studies. Furthermore, when we excluded the studies at moderate or high risk of selection bias, only one study remained, which showed no evidence of an effect of the intervention on knowledge. Overall, therefore, this review has found no evidence of an effect of interventions on the outcomes reported.</P>
<P>The outcomes addressed by the studies included in our review can be categorised into two groups: direct measures, which we included as our primary outcomes, and proxy measures, which we included as our secondary outcomes. Examples of direct measures include the number of episodes of relationship violence and the physical and psychosocial health outcomes occurring as a direct consequence of violence. Importantly, health outcomes, which constituted two of our primary outcomes, were not assessed by any of the studies included in our review. The noticeable absence of health outcomes, especially when the associations between violence and health have been extensively documented, is an important finding in itself. We regard the lack of findings on these outcomes as a significant gap in the existing literature rather than a poor choice of indicators on our part. Assessing the frequency of dating and relationship violence is another direct measure. This outcome is challenging to measure for a number of reasons. The stigma associated with relationship violence in some settings may lead to fear of disclosing or reporting episodes of violence. In other situations, violent behaviour may be long-standing such that it has become the 'norm', with victims blaming themselves for the violent behaviour of their partner and not seeking support. Peer pressure or the fear of retaliation may prevent victims from seeking help, and especially among adolescents, there may be poor knowledge about support services available. When cases are reported, information may not be available to researchers due to the non-disclosure of personal and sensitive information by officials. Finally, large studies with long follow-up periods are required in order to capture all events reliably.</P>
<P>Besides direct measures of effect, there are also proxy measures such as changes in attitudes, behaviour, knowledge and skills. These differ from direct measures in that they are important contributors to violence but require translation into action in order for a reduction in violence to occur. For example, even if attitudes towards relationship violence are improved and knowledge is increased, participants may not necessarily be able to apply this new information when faced with real-life incidents. Further research is required to assess whether (and how) changes in these proxy measures translate into reduced rates of relationship violence.</P>
<P>The aim of our review was to provide a comprehensive and unbiased summary of the existing evidence on interventions to prevent dating and relationship violence in adolescents and young adults. However, our results should be interpreted with caution for two main reasons. First, the studies included in our review varied greatly on several aspects. Participants ranged from general (low-risk) high school and university students to individuals with risk factors for experiencing or perpetrating relationship violence, such as a history of exposure to violence (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2003</LINK>) or adjudication (<LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK>). Our subgroup analyses comparing general to high-risk audiences revealed mixed results. Interventions appeared to be more effective at reducing the episodes of relationship violence experienced in high-risk audiences: the RR was not statistically significant in general audiences, but indicated a small but statistically significant reduction in risk in high-risk audiences. However, when assessing changes in attitudes, the SMD was not statistically significant for general audiences, and favoured the control group in high-risk audiences. Notably, for both outcomes, the high-risk 'subgroup' consisted of a single study. It is possible therefore that there were factors other than the type of participants that made these particular studies differ from others, and their results may not be generalisable to all studies with high-risk audiences.</P>
<P>Other studies targeted pregnant women, in whom exposure to relationship violence poses additional risks to their own health and that of the foetus. Furthermore, the focus was on couples rather than individuals in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Woodin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Woodin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florsheim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Florsheim 2011</LINK>). The relationship violence experienced by these couples, particularly the pregnant adolescent women and their co-habiting parenting partners participating in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Florsheim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Florsheim 2011</LINK>, may differ from the violence experienced by individuals who are not in an established relationship. For example, the latter group might experience violence in the context of dating and include cases of acquaintance rape. In more established relationships, partner violence may be of a more long-standing nature. The differences between 'dating violence' and 'relationship violence' require further research, especially as there may be important implications for prevention efforts. Finally, the adjudicated youth included in <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK> represent a group with complex social histories and backgrounds, which may affect their engagement with interventions. On a related note, there is an established link between alcohol and drug use and likelihood of dating or relationship violence. This was not explicitly controlled for within the studies and, while the focus of the review was on universal delivery of educational and skills-based interventions, drug and alcohol use is likely to have a negative impact on outcomes and this was not adequately described in the studies. While it can be argued that outcomes were still attainable even where drugs and alcohol are indicated, caution is still needed in interpreting the results.</P>
<P>Other variation between studies interventions arose in delivery settings, types of outcomes assessed, duration of the intervention, and duration of follow-up. The subgroup analysis by intervention setting was significant only for one outcome (knowledge of relationship violence) in one setting (university vs. school and community). Given that for the remaining 17 subgroup and outcome combinations the results were non-significant, we feel that the single significant outcome has arisen by chance. Intervention duration ranged between single 50-minute sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schewe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schewe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2009</LINK>) to 21 75-minute sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in effect by total contact hours or total number of sessions. The duration of follow-up varied greatly. The majority of studies assessed outcomes immediately following the intervention, with a further assessment between 1 and 12 months later. In order to determine more reliably whether interventions are effective and if so, whether their effects are long lasting and reduce the incidence of relationship violence in later adulthood, longer follow-up is required.</P>
<P>The second reason for interpreting our results with caution relates to methodological aspects of our review. Individual studies used a wide range of measurement scales to assess outcomes. We presented our results as SMDs, which assumes that each of the assessment measures can be standardised and has comparable SDs. This method also renders the translation of results into a quantifiable improvement or deterioration in outcomes challenging. For example, it is difficult to define what a 0.03-point improvement in the combined skills score means in practice and what level of statistically significant change is clinically significant. Combining results in a meta-analysis requires a number of methodological decisions to be made. We have tried to be as transparent as possible by detailing our methods and providing rationales for excluding any studies from meta-analyses.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the studies included in this review came from high-income countries. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Yom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yom 2005</LINK>, all studies were conducted in North America. There are a number of possible reasons for this. First, the term 'dating' may be less frequently used outside of North America. However, our search strategy included the term 'relationship' and other synonyms, which should have identified a broader range of titles. Second, the concept of dating itself may be less common outside of North America. In some lower-income countries marriage occurs at a younger age, so that if violence in a relationship occurs it is more likely to be classed as intimate partner violence rather than dating or relationship violence. Finally, it is possible that relationship violence is less commonly reported and less researched in other cultures.</P>
<P>With the exception of the Safe Dates study (<LINK REF="STD-Foshee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foshee 1998</LINK>), which followed participants up to four years post-intervention, <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>, which followed participants for 2.5 years post-intervention, and <LINK REF="STD-Florsheim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Florsheim 2011</LINK>, which followed participants up to 18 months post-intervention, most studies followed participants up to a maximum of 12 months. A few studies only conducted immediate post-test assessment. There is, therefore, little evidence on the long-term effectiveness of these interventions. As described above, the majority of studies assessed changes in proxy measures such as attitudes and knowledge, rather than episodes of violence and behavioural change. Further studies are required to explore the interaction between knowledge and attitudes on the one hand, and behaviour, skills and episodes of relationship violence on the other hand.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of most studies in this review was limited by unclear methods of random sequence generation, allocation concealment and assessor blinding, as illustrated in the 'Risk of bias' graph (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and 'Risk of bias' summary (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). While questionnaire scores (as used by most studies) may be less affected by lack of assessor blinding than other outcomes, we felt that the fact that none of the studies raised this point as a consideration was a significant shortcoming. Blinding of personnel delivering the interventions was not possible. However, some studies implemented ways of minimising the effects of this by providing training sessions for staff, scripts and monitoring a selection of sessions to ensure adherence to the study protocol. Studies not implementing these activities were considered to be at high risk of performance bias. We downgraded the evidence from 'high' to 'moderate' for all outcomes in our <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Another significant concern was the cluster or quasi-cluster randomisation methods used in 19 of the included studies. Participants were randomised by schools or classes to decrease the risk of cross-contamination and for practicality. Only one study used an ICC to account for the effect of clustering, though the ICC used was low compared to ICCs of other similar studies. The results of the cluster-RCTs included in this reviews are, therefore, likely to overestimate the effects of the interventions. Finally, many included studies had small numbers of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schewe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schewe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boulter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boulter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shultz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2006</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Woodin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Woodin 2010</LINK> had fewer than 100 participants each) and short periods of follow-up (maximum follow-up periods were two weeks or less in <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schewe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schewe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avery_x002d_Leaf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Avery-Leaf 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macgowan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Macgowan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lanier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinzone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pinzone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saberi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Saberi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pacifici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pacifici 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2009</LINK>), which is likely to affect their quality adversely by decreasing their statistical power and increasing the risk of type I and type II errors.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-24 23:23:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although a large number of articles were initially identified by our search strategy, it is still possible that some relevant studies were missed. Correspondence with authors yielded three further eligible studies that had not been identified by our search strategy. Many authors that we contacted did not reply and it is possible that further relevant studies could have been missed. Two review authors (GF and CH) independently screened titles and abstracts, which minimised the potential for bias in selecting studies for inclusion.</P>
<P>Eighteen studies that appeared by title or abstract to meet our eligibility criteria could not be assessed because full texts were not available. These studies have therefore been listed as 'awaiting classification'. Some of the missing studies are doctoral theses, which we were unable to retrieve despite requesting interlibrary loans, contacting authors and corresponding with universities where the doctoral title was awarded. Other studies were published in journals that we were unable to access. We do not know whether these studies are eligible for inclusion in our review and, if so, how they would have affected our results. Funnel plots for the outcomes that included 10 or more studies showed no evidence of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). However, it is possible that the studies that we were unable to retrieve are in themselves the result of a publication bias that exists in the general literature; in other words, it may be that the very reason we found these studies difficult to access is that they are studies with inconclusive or negative findings that are less likely to be published or more difficult to retrieve (<LINK REF="REF-Scargle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scargle 2000</LINK>). It is possible that the failure to include these studies overestimated the effect sizes of interventions and introduced bias into this review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>As outlined in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section, we conducted single pair-wise comparisons to avoid double-counting and unit of analysis issues. In some cases, this may have diluted the effect of interventions, for example in studies where high-risk and low-risk participants, or those with and those without a history of sexual victimisation were combined into single groups. Combining all outcome assessments up to 12 months into one outcome in our analysis may also have had an effect on our results. For example, it is possible that the effectiveness of interventions was greatest immediately following the intervention, with the effects gradually wearing off with time. However, the substantial differences in outcome assessments made it difficult to assess the effects separately. There was an insufficient number of studies to perform a separate analysis of outcomes assessed between 6 and 12 months as we had planned.</P>
<P>The ICC of 0.15 that we used to adjust for the effect of clustering is likely to lead to conservative estimates of effect. However, we felt this to be the most appropriate ICC based on a review of ICCs used in meta-analyses of similar topics. It would have been preferable if individual studies had ascertained their own ICCs, or if different ICCs were available depending on whether randomisation occurred at class or school level. An insufficient quantity of examples of ICCs was found to enable us to conduct ICC sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>The decision to include quasi-RCTs in our review was based on an assumption that this could be a common method of allocating participants to groups for logistic reasons, particularly in the case of cluster-RCTs. The inclusion of quasi-RCTs may have introduced bias into our results as they are at high risk of allocation bias. However, sensitivity analyses showed that including these studies made no significant difference to overall pooled results. </P>
<P>We included studies where more than 80% of the sample was within the age range of 12 to 25 years in anticipation that some community-based studies may target a wider range of age groups. The only studies that included participants higher than our stated age range were those set in universities, which captured a number of mature students (<LINK REF="STD-Forst-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2009</LINK>). The percentage of students outside of the age range in these studies was very low. Only one included study had participants younger than our age range (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>): students were aged 10 to 14 years, with a mean of 12.8 years and the majority were aged 13 years. It is unlikely that these small numbers would have influenced our results. Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in effect by intervention setting. As participant age is directly correlated with setting, we feel that there is little risk of the inclusion of these studies impacting our results.</P>
<P>Non-RCT studies on the topic of relationship and dating violence and those that were excluded from our review were not systematically reviewed.</P>

<P>Whitaker et al conducted a systematic review of primary prevention programmes for the perpetration of partner violence (<LINK REF="REF-Whitaker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitaker 2006</LINK>). The authors found that nine of the 11 included studies reported at least one positive intervention effect for knowledge, attitude or behaviour and concluded that such prevention programmes are promising. This finding differs from the lack of evidence of an effect found in our review. However, the review by Whitaker et al included observational (non-randomised) trials, which may have influenced results. Results were summarised narratively, rather than by means of a meta-analysis. To our knowledge, no other systematic reviews on this topic have been conducted.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-15 14:58:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently a wide range of interventions based in educational and community settings aimed at the prevention of dating and relationship violence in adolescents and young adults. The studies included in this review showed no evidence that these interventions reduce episodes of violence or improve attitudes, behaviours and skills related to relationship violence. There was evidence of a small increase in knowledge but this result must be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity among studies. Most studies had methodological shortcomings, which may have led to overestimation of their effects, especially when cluster randomisation was used. Importantly, our results show no evidence of effect, rather than evidence of no effect. Therefore, current interventions should not necessarily be stopped, but rather further research and more methodologically sound studies should be conducted.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-24 21:21:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further evidence is required to assess the effectiveness of interventions to prevent dating and relationship violence. The current evidence is predominantly focused on assessing changes in attitudes and knowledge. Research into the effects of interventions on incidence of relationship or dating violence, and exploration of the relationship between attitudes and knowledge and skills, behaviour and episodes of violence are needed. It is possible that in order to reduce the occurrence of relationship violence effectively, a number of interventions across both educational and community settings as well as within homes and families is required. Exploring these themes will require larger RCTs with longer follow-up periods.</P>
<P>Researchers should consider using existing reliable and validated scales such as the RMAS (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1980</LINK>) or the Revised CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Straus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straus 1996</LINK>). New measurement scales developed by authors have often not been adequately validated, and the use of multiple different scales renders the comparison of results from different studies difficult.</P>
<P>Although RCTs are preferable to cluster-RCTs, in practice it is often more feasible to conduct the latter. In this case, authors should adjust results using an ICC to avoid overestimating the effect of the interventions. We identified ICCs from a number of meta-analyses on similar topics by searching CENTRAL. However, a wider and more systematic search would be helpful in ascertaining the range of ICCs used across cluster-RCTs and establishing the most appropriate ICC figure to use.</P>
<P>With one exception, all studies were conducted in North America. Interventions addressing relationship violence are likely to be highly culturally sensitive and it is important to understand what types of interventions are effective in different settings. Further studies are, therefore, required from high-, middle- and low-income countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia.</P>

<P>We planned to conduct meta-analyses if heterogeneity between studies had an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 50% or less. This was based on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> guidance, which categorises an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of greater than 50% as suggestive of substantial heterogeneity. However, following data extraction, we found that our outcomes of episodes of relationship violence and knowledge of relationship violence had I<SUP>2 </SUP>values of 57% and 52%, respectively. We decided to continue with our meta-analyses and present results as these were important outcomes and because the values were both very close to the cut-off of 50%. We included these findings in our results but advise caution in their interpretation.</P>
<P>As stated in our protocol, we planned to conduct ICC analyses. However, only one included study reported using an ICC (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2009</LINK>) and, given this was 0.02, we maintained that this was insufficiently conservative based on meta-analysis of other similar subjects. For our analyses, we adopted an ICC of 0.15 based on two similar reviews: first, a review of school-based programmes to prevent violence, which used ICC values of 0.1 and 0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>) and second, a meta-analysis of multi-component preventive interventions for children at risk of antisocial behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-CPPRG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPPRG 1999</LINK>), which used an ICC value of 0.15.</P>
