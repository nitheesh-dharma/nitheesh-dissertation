<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-07 09:48:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Spasticity commonly causes a 'stiffness' or 'tightness' in the already weakened muscles of a person with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as motor neuron disease). This can lead to even greater difficulties in the ability to perform day-to-day activities. This review found only one randomized trial of treatment for spasticity in motor neuron disease, which involved 25 participants, and no further trials have been found in subsequent updates. There were a number of issues with the design of the study which unfortunately reduced the certainty of the findings. At three months participants performing the 15 minute twice daily exercises had significantly less spasticity overall than control participants (mean reduction of -0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to +0.17 in the treatment group versus an increase of +0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to +0.96 in control) but the mean change between groups was not significant, as measured by the Ashworth scale (a scale of spasticity, with a range of 0 to 5, where higher is worse). The trial was too small to determine whether individualized moderate intensity endurance type exercises for the trunk and limbs are beneficial or harmful. No side effects from exercise were reported. No other randomized trials of different treatments or therapies were found. Further research is needed to determine if exercise or other therapies such as anti-spasticity medication are beneficial or harmful.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-07 09:26:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included quasi-randomized or randomized controlled trials of participants with probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to the El Escorial diagnostic criteria (or a revised version) or the Airlie House revision.

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-06 13:37:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-07 09:51:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease is the most common form of motor neuron disease. Annual incidence rates are approximately 1 to 3 per 100,000 population with prevalence rates approximately 3 to 9 per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Chancellor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chancellor 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1991</LINK>). The rates increase with advancing age (the disease is rare below 40 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Mulder-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulder 1980</LINK>) with a small male predominance. The vast majority of cases of ALS occur randomly throughout the world with notable concentrations in Guam and parts of Japan. In five per cent of cases, the disease is familial with an autosomal dominant inheritance (<LINK REF="REF-Mulder-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulder 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>In ALS, motor nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain undergo marked degeneration and eventual premature death. Sensory nerve cells are remarkably preserved, as is the motor supply to ocular and sphincteric muscles. The cause is unknown, but toxic accumulations of glutamate may be an early event in the pathogenesis of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Plaitakis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plaitakis 1993</LINK>). Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor may slow the progression of the disease but otherwise ALS is currently incurable (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The widely accepted El Escorial criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1994</LINK>) or the more recent Airlie House revision (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2000</LINK>) are used to help make the diagnosis. Essentially evidence of progressive lower and upper motor neuron dysfunction, in the absence of other diseases (as determined by electrophysiological, pathological or radiological testing) is required for the diagnosis.</P>
<P>Most patients with ALS experience a relentless and rapid deterioration of axial and limb muscle strength and endurance together with dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing) and dysarthria (difficulty with speech). This parallels the progressive functional decline and eventual death (usually from respiratory failure) three to four years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spasticity (defined as a velocity dependent increase in muscle tone) commonly occurs to some degree in most patients with ALS. Patients with spasticity often experience a sensation of 'stiffness' or 'tightness' in the affected muscles. Voluntary movement becomes increasingly difficult and the affected limb(s) might 'twitch' or 'jump' and are hard to position or move. Generally this reflects damage in the corticospinal tracts with subsequent loss or reduction in the suprasegmental control of spinal cord segmental reflexes (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The development of spasticity in people with ALS adds significantly to their functional decline and to the reduction in quality of life for the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1991</LINK>). Spasticity contributes to the loss of motor control in the upper and lower extremities, making the limbs stiff and poorly co-ordinated. Spasticity also accelerates joint contracture formation, which then interferes with function and /or personal care. For example hip adductor spasticity can interfere with activities such as toileting. Many people with ALS complain of painful muscle cramps or spasms which may be related to spasticity. Treatment methods vary widely and can range from 'medical' marijuana through to intrathecal baclofen. Most commonly, passive stretching techniques are used in combination with one or more 'true' muscle relaxants (such as baclofen or dantrolene) (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1998</LINK>). Medical therapies can cause potentially deleterious side effects. Most of the 'true' muscle relaxants, for example, can cause further generalized weakness, something that in people with ALS is very undesirable. More aggressive spasticity interventions (such as intrathecal baclofen pumps) may be appropriate in select individuals but are not without risks. Even exercise may provoke a more rapid decline in function (<LINK REF="REF-Kilmer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilmer 1994</LINK>) although this issue remains unsettled (<LINK REF="REF-Dall-Bello_x002d_Haas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dall Bello-Haas 2008</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-12-12 12:30:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (4 July 2011) using 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' or 'motor neuron disease' AND 'spasticity' as the search terms. We adapted this strategy to search CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2011), CINAHL (January 1982 to July 2011), AMED (January 1985 to July 2011) and LILACS (January 1982 to July 2011).</P>
<P>The strategies used can be found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> (CENTRAL), <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> (MEDLINE), <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> (EMBASE), <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> (CINAHL), <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> (AMED) and <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> (LILACS).</P>
<P>We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 13:36:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (LS and DD) independently screened the abstracts of potential trials retrieved from the searches. Review authors were blinded with regard to trial author, institution and journal. After reading the abstract, we eliminated (or included) studies if both authors agreed that the trial did not meet (or met) the inclusion criteria. We resolved any disagreement by the decision of the contact author (NA).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:06:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two review authors (NA, LS) independently extracted the data for all outcome measures of interest which were reported within a study. One review author would have entered data into Review Manager (RevMan) and a second author would have checked data entry. We contacted the primary author of potentially eligible studies when necessary to resolve ambiguities in their reported methodologies or results, and to seek additional pertinent information that was not described in the published manuscript.</P>
<P>For all of the continuous outcomes (such as spasm frequency scores and range of motion) we would have extracted the number of participants, the mean and a measure of dispersion (standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (SEM) or 95% confidence interval (95% CI)) for each group in the study. SEMs and 95% CIs would have been transformed into SDs before being entered into RevMan. For dichotomous variables (i.e. improved/not-improved) we would have extracted the number of participants and the number of events for each group in the study. We would also have extracted other details of the included trials such as participant characteristics (age, sex, health status etc.), the study setting, the source of funding of the study, power, the number of people not prepared to enter the study and the number of drop-outs in each group.</P>
<P>When the data to be extracted were not available in the article we attempted to contact the authors. If post-intervention measures of dispersion (SD, SEM or 95% CI) were not available (such as when post-intervention information is expressed as a per cent change from baseline values) we would have used the measure of dispersion at baseline as the post-intervention value. We would only have performed this extrapolation if other pre- and post- measures of dispersion were similar for the same outcomes in other trials.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:07:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>All three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of all included trials. We assessed studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We independently assessed whether there was a high, low or unclear risk of bias for six domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other risks of bias.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The three authors performed quality assessment independently and differences were resolved by majority vote. We did not exclude studies on the basis of a poor quality score.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-12-07 09:44:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>If data were available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality, we would have performed statistical analyses using the RevMan software.</P>
<P>Given the likely heterogeneity between various medical and surgical treatments we would have performed separate analyses for each treatment type. We would then have made a comparison of summary statistics for each treatment to at least estimate statistically which treatment was better (or worse) than another.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we would generally have used mean differences (MD) between the post-intervention values, or the difference between baseline values and post-intervention values, of the intervention and control groups to analyse the size of the effects of the interventions. We would have expressed the effect sizes for dichotomous data in terms of risk ratio (RR). We would have used 95% CIs to express uncertainty about MD or RRs.

<P>We would have initially analyzed all data with a fixed-effect model. We would have tested for heterogeneity between trial results using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. Tests of heterogeneity are used for examining whether the observed variation in study results is compatible with the variation expected by chance alone. We would have used a significance level of alpha = 0.1 for the test of heterogeneity in view of the low power of such tests. If we had found heterogeneity, we would have attempted to determine potential sources of heterogeneity with various subgroup and sensitivity analyses. If statistical heterogeneity still could not be explained and pooling of results seemed appropriate (sufficiently similar studies of similar quality), we would have used a random-effects model which assumes that the effect size varies across studies.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 13:37:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>A search of the electronic databases revealed a total of 127 papers and we found one paper later. However, we easily excluded 123 papers because of duplication between databases, papers that did not report a clinical trial (review articles, letters to the editor, case reports and so on) and papers that did not include patients with motor neuron disease. Updated searches of the electronic databases in February 2005 revealed a further 31 potentially relevant references but none were RCTs. Updated searches of the electronic databases in April 2008 revealed a further 24 potential relevant references but none were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Searches were again updated in 2011; the new, current strategies retrieved 73 papers from MEDLINE (42 new), 32 from EMBASE (7 new), 6 from AMED (3 new), 1 from LILACS (0 new), 17 from CINAHL Plus (2 new), 9 from the Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (0 new) and 6 from CENTRAL, but no additional RCTs.</P>
<P>Of the final five we excluded one (<LINK REF="STD-Civardi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Civardi 1994</LINK>) because the trial studied participants with stroke and not motor neuron disease (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Another (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>) was excluded because spasticity was not measured as a specific outcome measure (although it was mentioned as a potential side effect of the study drug, riluzole). One trial done in 1978 (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1979</LINK>) comparing oral baclofen with placebo, was excluded because we could not ascertain how the diagnosis of ALS was made. Finally one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Guiloff-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guiloff 1987</LINK>), that looked at the immediate (within several hours) effect of a TRH analogue given intravenously, was excluded because we could not determine if the clinically based spasticity scale they used was a validated measure.</P>
<P>The single included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>) consisted of 25 ALS patients randomized to a moderate exercise group or to 'usual' activities (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Exercises were provided on an individual basis to each participant (in the treatment group) by a physical therapist. Factors taken into consideration were the participants' general health, neurological status and actual fitness level. Most muscle groups in the four limbs and trunk were exercised for about 15 minutes, twice a day. The overall aim "was to improve muscle endurance, having the muscles work against only modest loads but [still] undergo significant changes in length". Every 14 days patients were contacted by telephone (in both groups) to check adherence and the entire exercise program was reviewed at each clinic visit. Spasticity was measured using the Ashworth scale. This is an ordinal scale ranging from zero (no increase in muscle tone) to five (affected part is rigid in flexion or extension). Muscle strength, function, pain, fatigue and quality of life were also measured using validated measures.</P>

<P>The included trial was quasi-randomized by using the last digit of the patients medical ID number (odd versus even). Despite this, however, there were no significant baseline differences between treatment and control groups in terms of age, duration of disease, bulbar onset or function. Participants, clinicians and evaluators were not blinded (admittedly it would have been difficult to blind participants). The number and reason for study withdrawals was given. Drop-out rates were high (as one would expect given the clinical course of ALS), such that no analysis was possible at 9 and 12 months. Drop-outs were excluded from the statistical analysis.</P>

<P>Primary outcome measure: reduction in spasticity at three months or greater as measured by Ashworth (or modified Ashworth) spasticity scale.</P>
<P>In the single included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>) spasticity, as measured by the Ashworth scale, increased at three months in the control group (mean increase was +0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to +0.96) and decreased in the exercise group (mean decrease was -0.43, 95% CI -1.03 to +0.17). However, the mean difference in the change in Ashworth score from baseline to three months between the exercise and control groups was -0.68 (95% CI -1.62 to +0.26, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) which was not statistically significant. At six months there was no difference compared with baseline in the remaining participants (mean change 0 in both groups). The overall mean Ashworth scores at three months were 0.2 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.46) for the exercise group and 0.75 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.02) for the control group, and at six months 0.25 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.57) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.08) respectively. The overall mean difference in Ashworth scores were statistically significant between the exercise and control groups (using the Mann Whitney test with P value = 0.05) at three months (-0.55, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.14, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) but not at six months.</P>
<P>The drop-out rate at six months was high (not unexpected in this patient group) at almost 50% in both groups. Reasons for drop-out were the institution of mechanical ventilation, increasing difficulty attending clinic visits and death.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 13:27:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The finding of only one RCT in the world literature that looked at the treatment of spasticity in motor neuron disease obviously implies that there is a huge gap in our knowledge of this area.</P>
<P>Whilst it may be tempting to use existing anti-spasticity medications (that have shown benefit in other conditions) these may be associated with muscle weakness or fatigue, very undesirable side effects in motor neuron disease. A number of RCTs have reported muscle weakness as a side effect of most anti-spasticity medications (for example see the Cochrane review on anti-spasticity agents for multiple sclerosis <LINK REF="REF-Shakespeare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shakespeare 2003</LINK>), although other studies have shown that baclofen and tizanidine may be an exception (<LINK REF="REF-Milanov-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milanov 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nance-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nance 1994</LINK>). However, none have looked specifically at the motor neuron disease population. With the exception of the moderate intensity endurance exercise program used in Drory's study (<LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>) other medical, surgical and alternative therapies have not been tested in RCTs.</P>
<P>The exercise program used by Drory et al. produced a statistically significant improvement in overall spasticity at three months but was not significant when the mean change in spasticity from baseline to three months was analyzed compared with the control group. Function (as measured by the ALS functional rating scale) was significantly improved at three months in the exercise group (manual muscle testing, fatigue severity and quality of life were also better but not statistically). There was no difference seen in terms of musculoskeletal pain. The exercise program was individualized to each patient by a physical therapist and designed to be performed twice a day for 15 minutes. The exercise appears to have been reasonably well tolerated and accepted by the participants (as no one dropped out specifically because of this). Adherence was not directly measured so we cannot be sure to what degree individuals simply did not comply (fully or partially) with their exercise. Cost was not examined in Drory's study but it seems likely that this represents a very low cost intervention.</P>
<P>We could find no evidence of the use of an exercise program specifically to reduce spasticity in the non-randomized literature. The availability of a physical therapist (physiotherapist) or exercise therapist to prescribe an individualized exercise program will likely vary from region to region. However exercise prescription is not a difficult task in most cases and could be well within the capabilities of a number of other health professionals (for example, nursing). It may be time consuming, particularly if patients are to be followed up frequently (which in many types of exercise programs is often an important component to ensure adherence). The use of exercise is attractive conceptually as potentially this can also have many other benefits such as improved strength, function and quality of life. In addition costs are often relatively low. The single trial we found though is too small to make any clear recommendations on exercise however.</P>
<P>Current clinical practice in treating spasticity may vary somewhat between different clinicians and centers. It seems likely though that most would consider the use of an anti-spasticity drug initially (such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist baclofen or the newer alpha-2 agonist tizanidine) with a program of regular muscle stretching (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1992</LINK>). Other drugs are also used such as dantrolene and the benzodiazepines, and gabapentin has been reported to reduce spasticity in some ALS patients (<LINK REF="REF-de-Carvalho-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Carvalho 2001</LINK>). More invasive therapies are not usually recommended although intrathecal baclofen has been used successfully (<LINK REF="REF-Marquardt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquardt 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that spasticity is such an important and potentially treatable condition we feel it would be appropriate to undertake further research in order to determine which of the currently used treatments are really effective (and which may be harmful).</P>
