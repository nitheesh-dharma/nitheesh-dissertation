<TITLE>Stretching to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:11:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Many people stretch prior to or after engaging in physical activities such as sport. Usually the purpose is to reduce the risk of injury, reduce soreness after exercise, or enhance athletic performance. This review looked at the effects of stretching on muscle soreness only.</P>
<P>The review located 12 relevant randomised controlled studies looking at the effect of stretching before or after physical activity on muscle soreness. Eleven studies were small with between 10 to 30 people being allocated stretching exercises. In contrast, one study was large with 2337 participants, 1220 of whom were in the stretching group. Ten studies were conducted in laboratories using standardised exercises. The only two studies, which included the only large study, were so-called field-based studies. These examined the effect of stretching on muscle soreness associated with self-selected physical activity. The studies were of low to moderate quality. Some of the studies examined the effects of stretching before physical activity, some examined the effects of stretching after physical activity, and some examined effects of stretching both before and after physical activity.</P>
<P>The studies produced very consistent findings. They showed there was little or no effect of stretching on the muscle soreness experienced in the week after the physical activity.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 12:55:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to 10 August 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 8th February 2010), EMBASE (1988 to 8th February 2010), CINAHL (1982 to 23rd February 2010), SPORTDiscus (1949 to 8th February 2010), PEDro (to 15th February 2010) and reference lists of articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-03 12:21:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Eligible studies were randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any pre-exercise or post-exercise stretching technique designed to prevent or treat delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). For the studies to be included, the stretching had to be conducted soon before or soon after exercise and muscle soreness had to be assessed.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-11-08 16:16:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Risk of bias was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool and quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Estimates of effects of stretching were converted to a common 100-point scale. Outcomes were pooled in fixed-effect meta-analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-03 12:12:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Twelve studies were included in the review. This update incorporated two new studies. One of the new trials was a large field-based trial that included 2377 participants, 1220 of whom were allocated stretching. All other 11 studies were small, with between 10 and 30 participants receiving the stretch condition. Ten studies were laboratory-based and other two were field-based. All studies were exposed to either a moderate or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was low to moderate.</P>
<P>There was a high degree of consistency of results across studies. The pooled estimate showed that pre-exercise stretching reduced soreness at one day after exercise by, on average, half a point on a 100-point scale (mean difference -0.52, 95% CI -11.30 to 10.26; 3 studies). Post-exercise stretching reduced soreness at one day after exercise by, on average, one point on a 100-point scale (mean difference -1.04, 95% CI -6.88 to 4.79; 4 studies). Similar effects were evident between half a day and three days after exercise. One large study showed that stretching before and after exercise reduced peak soreness over a one week period by, on average, four points on a 100-point scale (mean difference -3.80, 95% CI -5.17 to -2.43). This effect, though statistically significant, is very small.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-01 21:25:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from randomised studies suggests that muscle stretching, whether conducted before, after, or before and after exercise, does not produce clinically important reductions in delayed-onset muscle soreness in healthy adults.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Many people stretch before or after (or before and after) engaging in athletic activity. Usually the purpose is to reduce the risk of injury, reduce soreness after exercise, or enhance athletic performance (<LINK REF="REF-Cross-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gleim-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleim 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gleim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleim 1997</LINK>). This review focuses on the effects of muscle stretching on muscle soreness. Another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2003</LINK>) has examined whether stretching prevents soft-tissue injury, and several non-Cochrane systematic reviews have examined whether stretching prevents muscle soreness or injury, or enhances performance (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fradkin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fradkin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubini 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shrier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Small-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thacker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thacker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weldon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weldon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The muscle soreness that is the focus of this review is sometimes called delayed-onset muscle soreness to differentiate it from soreness that occurs as muscle fatigue or immediately after muscles have been fatigued. Delayed-onset muscle soreness (hereafter referred to simply as muscle soreness) is usually caused by unaccustomed exercise, particularly exercise that requires primarily eccentric muscle action. Eccentric action occurs when a muscle generates tension to control the rate it lengthens. Typically the soreness arises within the first day after exercise and peaks in intensity at around 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Balnave-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balnave 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bobbert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobbert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wessel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessel 1994</LINK>). The soreness is usually associated with tenderness and may be associated with swelling (<LINK REF="REF-Bobbert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobbert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wessel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessel 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The series of events that ultimately cause muscle soreness are only partly understood. The initial event is probably mechanical disruption of sarcomeres (contractile units within muscle fibres; <LINK REF="REF-Proske-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proske 2001</LINK>). This causes swelling of damaged muscle fibres and initiates an inflammatory response, which could excite nociceptors (receptors capable of transmitting information about pain; <LINK REF="REF-Lieber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieber 2002</LINK>). Muscle soreness is usually only experienced when the muscle contracts or is stretched. This indicates that, while swelling of muscle fibres and inflammation may be necessary for muscle soreness to occur, swelling and inflammation are not sufficient to cause soreness on their own. Muscle soreness is exacerbated by vibration over the belly of the muscle and pressure thresholds increase when large diameter afferents are blocked (large diameter afferents are nerve cells that conduct information about touch and limb position). This indicates that excitation of large diameter muscle afferents, probably primary spindle afferents from stretch receptors in muscles, is involved in generating the sensation of soreness (<LINK REF="REF-Weerakkody-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weerakkody 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The practice of stretching to prevent muscle soreness was encouraged by early investigators of muscle soreness who thought that unaccustomed exercise caused muscle spasm (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1961</LINK>). Muscle spasm was believed to impede blood flow to the muscle, causing ischaemic pain and further spasm. Stretching the muscle was thought to restore blood flow to the muscle and interrupt the pain-spasm-pain cycle. The muscle spasm theory of muscle soreness has since been discredited (<LINK REF="REF-Bobbert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobbert 1986</LINK>) but the practice of stretching persists.</P>
<P>Typically people who stretch to prevent muscle soreness do so prior to exercise, but some people stretch after exercise. Usually each at-risk muscle is stretched for between 15 seconds and two minutes, once or several times. Some proponents of stretching recommend applying a sustained stretch to the relaxed muscle (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1961</LINK>; this is called static stretching), but others recommend more elaborate techniques such as the 'contract-relax-agonist contract' technique (<LINK REF="REF-Feland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feland 2001</LINK>). This technique and related techniques (collectively called proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques) involve contracting the muscle strongly before applying a stretch.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Herbert-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2007</LINK>). The earlier review concluded that the evidence derived from small, mainly laboratory-based studies of stretching indicated that pre-exercise or post-exercise muscle stretching does not reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness in young healthy adults. A large randomised trial (2,377 participants) of both pre-exercise and post-exercise stretching has been published since then.</P>

Some studies reported raw scores, whereas others report change scores or covariance-adjusted scores. It was also expected that outcomes would usually be measured at a series of times following exercise. Where available, data were extracted at one-day daily intervals following exercise. Only one outcome was recorded from each study for each time. Where data were available in more than one format, covariate-adjusted data were most preferred, then change scores, then raw scores. </P>

<P>Risk of bias was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Two authors independently assessed each study. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where necessary, the third author was consulted. It was anticipated that several of the included studies would be laboratory-based studies which were unlikely to describe elements thought to be important in conventional clinical trials. These studies may appear methodologically weak when assessed with a tool designed for clinical trials. Nonetheless it was thought useful to document the degree to which they conform with best practice clinical trial design.</P>

</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-06-02 22:56:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain data were typically reported on 100 mm visual analogue scales or 10-point scales. To facilitate pooling data were converted to a common 100-point scale. The effect of stretching was estimated from each study using the difference between mean pain levels in the stretch and comparison groups. Where there was apparent qualitative homogeneity in participants, interventions and outcome measures, meta-analysis was considered. The effects of stretching were described as mean differences. Data were inspected for statistical heterogeneity. The fixed-effect model was used to pool findings across studies where there was no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (Cochran Q, P &lt; 0.1 and low I<SUP>2</SUP>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). Effects of pre-exercise and post-exercise stretching were initially estimated separately but, as there was no evidence of heterogeneity, they were combined in a secondary analysis. A post-hoc analysis was conducted to obtain separate estimates from laboratory-based studies and the two community-based studies. An additional post-hoc analysis was conducted to obtain separate estimates from studies of static stretch and the one study that used another method of stretching.</P>

<P>Two new studies (one small and one large) were added in this update of the review. Most studies were small (less than 30 participants in the intervention group) but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>) involved 2377 participants, 1220 of whom were in the intervention group. In all but one study participants were young healthy adults (age less than 40 years or mean age less than 26 years); only <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK> had substantial representation of older adults (mean age 39.9 years, SD 12.6). All but two of the studies were carried out in laboratory settings and involved standardised exercise. The exceptions investigated the effect of post-game stretching on muscle soreness in Australian rules football players (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>) and effects of pre-exercise and post-exercise stretching by physically active people participating in self-selected recreational physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Three studies examined the effect of stretching before exercise (<LINK REF="STD-High-1989" TYPE="STUDY">High 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>), seven studies investigated the effects of stretching after exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gulick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-High-1989" TYPE="STUDY">High 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maxwell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maxwell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGlynn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McGlynn 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>), one study investigated the effects of stretching before exercise in one intervention group and after exercise in another intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>), and one study investigated effects of stretching before and after exercise in the same intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>). The stretch was of the knee extensor muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Buroker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Buroker 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-High-1989" TYPE="STUDY">High 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maxwell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maxwell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>), hamstring muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>), ankle plantarflexor muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Buroker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Buroker 1989</LINK>), wrist extensor muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Gulick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gulick 1996</LINK>), elbow flexor muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGlynn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McGlynn 1979</LINK>), or lower limb and trunk muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>). All but one of the studies examined the effects of static stretching; one study examined the effects of a ("hold-relax") PNF technique (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>). Three studies involved repeated stretching sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Buroker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Buroker 1989</LINK>: 12 sessions; <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>: before and after all physical activity for 12 weeks; <LINK REF="STD-McGlynn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McGlynn 1979</LINK>: 5 sessions). The duration of stretching applied in a single session ranged from 40 seconds (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>) to 900 seconds (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buroker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Buroker 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gulick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-High-1989" TYPE="STUDY">High 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maxwell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maxwell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGlynn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McGlynn 1979</LINK>), participants were randomly allocated to stretch and control conditions. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>) was a cross-over study in which each participant experienced both the stretch and control conditions. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>) stratified by participant and randomised legs to stretch and control conditions. Thus five studies (the single cross-over study and the four studies that compared right and left legs) provided paired comparisons. In all but two of these insufficient data were provided in the report to take account of the paired nature of the data. Both of the studies by Wessel and Wan (<LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>) provided confidence intervals for the differences between legs, making it possible to account for the paired nature of the data, but the estimates from an analysis which accounted for the paired nature of the data were less precise (<LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>) or had similar precision (<LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>) to estimates obtained by ignoring the paired nature of the data. Hence the data were treated as if they were independent. Consequently, data from all five studies with paired comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wessel-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Wessel 1994b</LINK>) were treated as independent.

<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> summarises the risk of bias assessments. All included studies were described as randomised, but adequate methods of sequence generation were only reported in four trials. Allocation concealment was certain in <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK> alone. There was no blinding in any studies: this is because it is difficult or impossible in studies of stretching to blind the person supervising the stretching exercises and the person doing the stretches and as the outcome (soreness) must be self-reported, the assessor cannot be blinded. Only one study clearly indicated that analysis was by intention-to-treat (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK>), analysis was explicitly not by intention-to-treat. Only two studies explicitly reported completeness of follow-up: <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK> reported data were available for 31 of 34 player-conditions and <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK> reported that participants provided a mean of 10.1 (SD 3.4) diary reports when they were asked to provide 12 reports. Two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-High-1989" TYPE="STUDY">High 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK>) provided data that implied follow-up was complete. It is likely that follow-up was complete or nearly complete in most or all of the other studies because the follow-up period was very short (one week or less) and outcome measures were not onerous.</P>
<P>Taken together, the quality of evidence of effects of pre-exercise or post-exercise stretching on muscle soreness after exercise is low to moderate.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:18:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gulick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gulick 1996</LINK>) reported only pooled data from all groups and another two (<LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maxwell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maxwell 1988</LINK>) did not provide any data that could be used to calculate precision. The author of one of these reports (<LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>) provided us with raw data so we were able to estimate the precision of that study. However, the standard deviations (SDs) were remarkably small, averaging just 3.8 on a 100-point scale. These SDs were much smaller than those for any other study and about one sixth of the pooled estimate of the SD from the remaining studies which reported SDs at the same time points. As a consequence, the effect of including data from this study in the analyses would have been to give very large weights (range 50% to 96%, mean 74%) to a small study which had just 9 or 10 observations in each group. Consequently we decided to exclude these data from this study in the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which data from this study were included.</P>
<P>There was a remarkable degree of consistency (homogeneity) of results across studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> for all pooled estimates was 0%). The pooled estimate was that pre-exercise stretching reduced soreness one day after exercise by, on average, half a point on a 100-point scale (mean difference (MD) -0.52, 95% CI -11.30 to 10.26, where negative effects indicate that stretching decreased soreness; 3 studies; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Post-exercise stretching reduced soreness one day after exercise by, on average, one point on a 100-point scale (MD -1.04, 95% CI -6.88 to 4.79; 4 studies; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Similar effects were evident up to three days after exercise.</P>
<P>As there was no sign of statistical heterogeneity, estimates from pre-exercise and post-exercise studies were pooled. The pooled estimates indicate that pre-exercise and post-exercise stretching reduces soreness, on average, by one point on a 100-point scale at one day (MD -0.93, 95% CI -6.05 to 4.20; 7 studies; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), increases soreness by one point on a 100-point scale at two days (MD 1.04, 95% CI -4.14 to 6.22; 7 studies; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) and has no effect on soreness at three days (MD -0.28; 95% CI -6.79 to 6.22; 5 studies; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The only large study (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>) examined effects of stretching before and after all episodes of physical activity undertaken over a 12 week period by people undertaking recreational exercise. <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK> found stretching reduced the intensity of the worst soreness experienced over a week by, on average, four points on a 100-point scale (MD -3.80; 95% CI -5.17 to -2.43; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK> reported that the risk of experiencing bothersome soreness in a week was 24.6% in the stretch group and 32.3% in the control group (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). In the only other study of the effects of stretching on soreness associated with recreational activity, <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2005</LINK> found that post-exercise stretching increased muscle soreness by, on average, three points on a 100-point scale (95% CI -7 to 13) at 15 hours and by four points (95% CI -5 to 13) at 48 hours after an Australian rules football match.</P>
<P>Similar estimates of effects were obtained in the only study that tested PNF stretching. <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1985</LINK> showed the effect of PNF stretching was to reduce soreness by one point (95% CI -13 to 11) on a 100-point scale at both one and two days after exercise</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis investigated the effects of including the data from one study with very small SDs (<LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK>): see the first paragraph of this section for an explanation. Including data from that <LINK REF="STD-Marques-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2006</LINK> yielded slightly larger estimates of the effects of stretching: the pooled estimates of the effects of pre-exercise or post-exercise stretching were that stretching reduced soreness, on average, by six points on a 100-point scale (95% CI -9 to -4) one day after exercise and by two points (95% -6 to 1) two days after exercise.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-03 12:26:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>When this review was first published it concluded the available evidence from randomised studies indicated that stretching soon before or soon after exercise does not produce important reductions in muscle soreness in the few days following exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Herbert-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2007</LINK>). That conclusion remains unchanged in this update of the review.</P>
<P>The primary analysis indicated that stretching has near-zero effects on soreness. Point estimates of the effect were that the average effect of stretching was to reduce soreness by up to four points on a 100-point scale. Inclusion of data from a study with very small standard deviations increased estimates slightly. The estimates were quite precise so, in the primary analyses, it was possible to rule out the possibility that the average effect of pre-exercise or post-exercise stretching was to reduce soreness by more than six points on a 100-point scale.</P>
<P>This update of the review incorporates two new studies, including one very large randomised trial with 2377 participants. The new trial provides an estimate of the effects of stretching both before and after exercise. The estimate is that stretching reduced soreness by, on average, four points on a 100-point scale. This effect, though statistically significant, is very small.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:22:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>All but two of the eligible studies were laboratory-based. These studies assessed whether supervised stretching reduced the soreness produced by standardised exercise involving eccentric contractions of a particular muscle group. Such studies can be considered to have an "explanatory" orientation (<LINK REF="REF-Herbert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2009</LINK>) because they tell us about what the effects of stretching could be when administered under ideal conditions. It might have been expected that the effects of stretching would be smaller in community settings. In community settings, unlike the laboratory settings of these studies, stretching is not usually supervised so it may be carried out suboptimally. Also, the everyday experience of muscle soreness may be across many muscle groups, and it may be difficult to effectively stretch all of the muscle groups that might become sore. These considerations suggest the effects of stretching might be smaller in community settings than in laboratory settings. However the estimates from 10 laboratory-based studies and two community-based study suggest there are similar (near-zero) effects in both settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:23:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>These conclusions are based on studies that rate poorly or moderately on conventional scales of study quality. Only one of the reviewed studies explicitly concealed allocation, none were blinded, few reported low rates of loss to follow-up and only one explicitly analysed by intention to treat. Nonetheless there are some reasons to believe that the findings may not be seriously biased: First, there is a high degree of consistency in estimates of the effect of stretching, both across studies and across comparisons. Also, biases due to non-concealment of allocation, lack of blinding, loss to follow-up and failure to analyse by intention-to-treat typically produce exaggerated effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) yet this review found consistent evidence of near-zero effects. The high degree of consistency of estimates across studies suggests that alternative weightings (based, for example, on different approaches to estimating precision from studies that used within-participant designs) would produce very similar pooled estimates of effects.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other comments</HEADING>
<P>The practice of stretching before or after exercise may have been arisen because of the mistaken belief, prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, that muscle soreness was due to muscle spasm (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1961</LINK>). This view has since been discredited (<LINK REF="REF-Bobbert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobbert 1986</LINK>). Contemporary beliefs about the mechanisms of muscle soreness do not suggest any means by which stretching before or after exercise could reduce the soreness that follows that exercise session. However if, as has been proposed, muscle soreness is due to excessive elongation of some sarcomeres within muscle fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Proske-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proske 2001</LINK>), it is conceivable that any intervention which increased the number of sarcomeres in series in muscle fibres, or which increased the length or compliance of tendons, could reduce sarcomere strains and lessen muscle damage associated with unaccustomed eccentric muscle contractions. This suggests the possibility that stretching may be more effective for people who have very short muscles, or if the stretching is repeated for weeks or months or years. The longest duration of stretching investigated in any of the trials conducted to date (<LINK REF="STD-Jamtvedt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jamtvedt 2010</LINK>) is 12 weeks. No randomised trials have specifically investigated interactions between effects of stretching and flexibility.</P>
<P>The best available evidence indicates that stretching does not reduce muscle soreness. However, there are other justifications for stretching. Some evidence suggests that once muscle soreness has developed, stretching may provide a transient relief of soreness (<LINK REF="REF-Reisman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisman 2005</LINK>). Some people stretch to reduce risk of injury, others stretch to enhance athletic or sporting performance, and yet others stretch because it gives them a sense of well-being. The current review does not provide any evidence of an effect or otherwise of stretching on risk of injury, performance or well-being.</P>

<P>The available evidence from randomised trials suggests that stretching before or after exercise does not produce important reductions in soreness in healthy adults.</P>
<P>Stretching could have other benefits. For example, it is widely believed that stretching can reduce injury risk, improve sporting performance and produce a feeling of readiness for exercise. People who are concerned about these outcomes should also consider the evidence of effects of stretching on these outcomes when deciding whether or not to stretch.</P>

<P>Arguably, the findings of this review are clear enough that further research into the effects of stretching on muscle soreness is not necessary. We see some merit in this view. There may be some merit in conducting further trials of the effects of longer-term stretching programs and trials of stretching for people with reduced flexibility.</P>

<P>The original protocol specified that study quality would be assessed using the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group quality assessment tool. In keeping with the change in Cochrane Collaboration policy, the update of the review used instead the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. In addition, GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
<P>In the first issue of the review, outcome data were extracted for outcomes at 12 hour intervals, rather than at 24 hour intervals. Extracting data at 12 hour intervals yielded little more data than when extracting data only at 24 hour intervals, substantially increased the number of tables and analyses, and had no effect on the findings of the review. Consequently, in the second round of review, only data from 24 hour intervals were included.</P>
<P>The protocol specified that a criterion for inclusion was that studies measured as outcomes either muscle soreness (pain) or tenderness (pain on palpation of the muscle). The first published version of the review did not identify any eligible studies which included only tenderness (not soreness) as an outcome. However, the second version identified one study that might have been considered to have measured tenderness (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). We were uncertain whether this study could be said to have measured tenderness and, had it been included, it would have been the only study included in the review that provided only tenderness data. Moreover, we were uncertain about how data on tenderness would contribute to the objective of the review ("to determine the effect of stretching before or after exercise on the development of post-exercise muscle soreness"). Consequently, we decided to exclude studies which measured tenderness but not soreness.</P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Buckenmeyer, P., Kokkinidis, E., Machairidou, M., Tsamourtas, A. The&lt;br&gt;effect of static stretching and cryotherapy on the recovery of delayed&lt;br&gt;muscle soreness. [Greek] [Article] Exercise &amp;amp; society journal of sport&lt;br&gt;science (Komotini) (19), 1998, 45-53 Total No. of Pages: 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Greek. The English abstract reads: &amp;quot;The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of static stretching and cryotherapy on delayed muscle soreness, that appears 24 hours after eccentric muscular activation of high intensity. Twelve students, (18 to 27 years old) were divided randomly in three groups: stretching (eight minutes of intermittent static stretching), cryotherapy (application of ice compressions for twenty minutes) and control. All subjects performed an eccentric exercise, for the purpose of which aimed at developing muscle soreness to the hamstring muscle group. The rehabilitation methods (stretching cryotherapy) were applied immediately after exercise and 24 hours later. Range of motion (sit and reach test) and muscle soreness (questionnaire) were evaluated 24 hours after exercise, after the second application of the rehabilitation methods and 48 hours after exercise. Analysis of the enzyme creatine kinase was carried out before exercise as well as 24 hours later. Strength (leg curl) was determined before exercise and 24 and 48 hours after exercise. A Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that 48 hours after exercise, the group of stretching was less sore (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, the two experimental methods affected temporarily the range of motion (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results of this study show that stretching can alleviate muscle soreness and restore the decreased range of motion. Cryotherapy also has a positive effect on the range of motion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;In Chinese. English abstract reads: &amp;quot;The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of massage, stretch and meloxicam on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Twenty-eight healthy and untrained male subjects participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to four different groups: 1) massage, 2) stretch, 3) meloxicam, and 4) control groups. All subjects underwent an exercise bout at a workload equal to subjects' own body weight with quarter squats until exhaustion. Subjects in stretch group received a 10-minute passive static stretch immediately after exercise. Subjects in meloxicam group received a 7.5mg-meloxicam immediately after exercise. Subjects in massage group received the first 15-minute massage two hours after exercise. Control group rest for 15 minutes after exercise. Treatments were reapplied at 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. Plasma creatine kinase (CK), range of motion (ROM) and rating of muscle soreness of the quadriceps were measured six different times, before and after exercise, and again after receiving respective treatments. The results showed that: 1) The treatments of stretch, massage and meloxicam could reduce the soreness response; 2) The stretch group performed better ROM the other groups; 3) When DOMS was induced, and CK reached the peak level, the massage and meloxicam treatments could significantly reduce the plasma CK level. It was therefore concluded that stretch was an effective method to increase ROM after muscles experience soreness after exercise. Massage and meloxicam were effective to reduce the plasma CK level after exercise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="BOOK">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;In Chinese. The English abstract reads: &amp;quot;Immuno-electron microscopic observation of the localization of M-protein, alpha-actinin and myosin was made to study the nature of delayed structural alteration of myofibril and the effective mechanism of oblique acupuncture and static stretch on the structural recovery of skeletal muscle myofibril after strenuous exercise. It was observed that: 1. different degrees of structural alteration of Z-line and M-line especially the alteration of thick filament after total disruption of M-line were found; 2. delayed structural alteration of myofibril was accompanied by decrease in label density of contractile proteins and diffusion of these proteins to their adjacent area within sarcomere, these results suggested that delayed alteration of contractile structure was the result of the predominant degradation of contractile protein after over exertion. Therefore, the delayed structural alteration of myofibril could be defined as physiological of transitive state from physiological to pathological in nature. The mechanism of acupuncture and static stretch for relieving muscle soreness or pain is not the same as acupuncture anesthesia, however, by enhancing the turnover (anabolic process) of contractile protein it promotes the structural recovery of the myofibril and relieves soreness or pain of muscle at the same time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

English abstract reads: &amp;quot;The immuno-electron microscopic method was used to study the nature of ultrastructural alteration of M-line in human skeletal muscle after strenuous exercise and the effect of acupuncture or static stretch on those alterations. It was observed that the label density of M-line of the control thigh was lower than that of the acupunctured, but higher on both sides with equal width of the M-line and areas beyond in the sarcomers. Similar results were observed in the static stretch group, but the difference of label density between the control and the static stretch in the areas beyond M-line was nonsignificant. It was also indicated that acupuncture or static stretch could effectively enhance the synthesis of M-protein and promote the recovery process of the M-line. The volume density of the ultrastructural alteration of M-line decreasing from 42-48 percent in the control to 6-9 percent in the acupunctured or static stretched thigh presented further support to the explanation described above.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;In Chinese. English abstract reads: &amp;quot;In order to elucidate the nature of the ultrastructural alterations of Z-band in human skeletal muscles after strenuous exercise and the effect of acupuncture or static stretch on those alterations, we used the rabbit anti-alpha-actinin antiserum and anti-rabbit IgG-gold complex as the label to localize the alpha-actinin of Z-band on the ultrathin sections, of which the tissue was embedded with Lowicryl K4M. The biopsies were taken from vastus lateralis muscles of both thighs of 6 males (aged 20-22 years) 48 hours after exercise. With one thigh as the control, acupuncture or static stretch was treated randomly on the other thigh of each subject at different times and immediately before biopsies. It was found that the specific label density of Z-band of acupunctured or static stretched thigh was 76.64 gold particle/um2 in the acupunctured and 59.25 in the control, 51.02 in the static stretched and 35.44 in the control. The difference between those with or without treatment was significant. Moreover, acupuncture or static stretch can also reduce the rate of ultrastructural changes of Z-band by 36 percent and 22 percent respectively. Results indicate that acupuncture or static stretch can either inhibit the process of ultrastructural alterations of Z-band caused by depolymerization or degradation of alpha-actinin, or promote the process of recovery by accelerating the polymerization or synthesis of alpha-actinin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
