<P>Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) is a new technique to supplement mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care, but benefit and safety have not been proven. Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI - also called 'dead space washout') is a new add-on technique for mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing) for babies in neonatal intensive care. It requires new and expensive specialised equipment and skills. TGI involves sending a continuing flow of air/oxygen into the lower part of a baby's trachea (windpipe). The review found only one trial of TGI, which showed it might reduce the length of time babies need mechanical ventilation, but not necessarily reduce the time on oxygen therapy or the stay in hospital. More research is needed to establish if this technology is safe and beneficial.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-03-17 11:18:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) is a technique where a continuous flow of gas is instilled into the lower trachea during conventional mechanical ventilation. TGI can improve carbon dioxide removal with lower ventilation pressures and smaller tidal volumes, potentially decreasing secondary lung injury and chronic lung disease (CLD).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether, in mechanically ventilated neonates, the use of tracheal gas insufflation reduces mortality, CLD and other adverse clinical outcomes without significant side effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-17 11:18:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches were made of MEDLINE 1966 to December 2001, CINAHL 1982 to December 2001, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001) and conference and symposia proceedings.</P>
<P>This search was updated in December 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) that include newborn infants who are mechanically ventilated, and compare TGI during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) with CMV alone. Primary outcomes - mortality, CLD and neurodevelopmental outcome; secondary outcomes - air leak, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of hospital stay, retinopathy of prematurity, immediate adverse effects. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Each reviewer assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data separately. Study authors were contacted for additional information if necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one small study was found to be eligible. This study found no evidence of effect on mortality, CLD or age at first extubation. The total duration of ventilation was 9.3 days shorter in the TGI group (95% CI from 15.7 to 2.9 days shorter). The age at complete weaning from ventilation was 26 days shorter in the TGI group (95% CI from 46 to 6 days shorter). There was no evidence of effect on the total duration of respiratory support, oxygen therapy or hospital stay. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence from a single RCT that TGI may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants - although the data from this small study do not give sufficient evidence to support the introduction of TGI into clinical practice. The technical requirements for performing TGI (as performed in the single included study) are great. There is no statistically significant reduction in the total duration of respiratory support or hospital stay. TGI cannot be recommended for general use at this time.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-14 14:36:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-14 14:35:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants have a very high dead space to tidal volume ratio which can limit the amount of CO2 clearance possible with conventional mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Dassieu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dassieu 1998</LINK>). This high dead space to tidal volume ratio leads to a relatively greater amount of CO2 trapped in the dead space in the smallest of infants (e.g. extremely low birth weight infants who are most at risk of developing chronic lung disease). Increased CO2 clearance may only be possible by increasing tidal volume, with possible adverse effects such as volutrauma, acute lung injury and chronic lung disease. In this situation washing CO2 out of the trachea may be of particular benefit.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-14 14:35:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI), or dead space washout, is a technique where, in addition to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), a continuous flow of gas (air/oxygen) is instilled into the lower trachea. This additional flow, or insufflation, of gas can occur throughout the ventilator cycle or only during expiration, with or without the addition of active aspiration of gas from the trachea during expiration (<LINK REF="REF-De-Robertis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Robertis 1999</LINK>). TGI can be achieved with the insufflation of gas via extra lumens in the endotracheal tube (ETT) or a catheter placed down the primary lumen of an ETT.</P>
<P>TGI has been demonstrated to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and lower arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bernath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernath 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-De-Robertis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Robertis 1999</LINK>), and in uncontrolled studies in human adults (<LINK REF="REF-Richecoeur-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richecoeur 1999</LINK>) and preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Danan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danan 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dassieu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dassieu 1998</LINK>). It allows the use of lower peak inspiratory pressures and smaller tidal volumes to achieve similar PaCO2s, potentially decreasing volu- and baro-trauma, and secondary lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Bernath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernath 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-De-Robertis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Robertis 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Richecoeur-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richecoeur 1999</LINK>). In neonates this could potentially lead to decreased chronic lung disease (CLD).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-14 14:35:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reports in the literature describe the use of TGI in preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Danan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danan 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dassieu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dassieu 1998</LINK>). Both studies were uncontrolled and investigated short-term respiratory outcomes only. They both confirmed that TGI increases CO2 removal and allows the use of smaller tidal volumes and lower peak inspiratory pressures, but neither assessed the effect on the incidence of CLD.</P>
<P>The response to, or benefit from, TGI may not be the same for all neonates but may vary according to birth weight and/or gestational age. Furthermore, there may be variation in effect dependent upon the strategy used: 1) TGI administered throughout the respiratory cycle or only during expiration, 2) tracheal gas aspiration used simultaneously with TGI or TGI used alone, 3) TGI used as an elective procedure or as rescue treatment.</P>
<P>Potential side effects relate to the smaller internal diameter of the endo-tracheal tubes required for the technique or the use of intra-luminal ETT catheters, possibly increasing the incidence of ETT tube obstruction; increased ETT handling, possibly increasing the incidence of accidental extubation; and uncontrolled manipulations of minute ventilation, possibly resulting in fluctuations in PaCO2 and altered haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow or oxygenation with consequent adverse neurological sequelae.</P>

<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the trials: standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used.</P>
<P>The two reviewers worked independently to search for and assess trials for inclusion and methodological quality. Studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies Table.</P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias Table:</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed &#8220;partial&#8221; was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Only one study was identified and found eligible for inclusion in this review. Dassieu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dassieu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dassieu 2000</LINK>) performed a randomised, controlled trial comparing conventional pressure-controlled ventilation and continuous tracheal gas insufflation with conventional pressure-controlled ventilation alone in preterm infants. The trial included infants &lt;30 weeks gestational age who were ventilated for hyaline membrane disease and had received surfactant. Included infants had to be randomised by six hours of age. Forty-one infants were randomised and after seven post-randomisation exclusions 34 infants were studied - 15 TGI and 19 control. The mean (SD) gestational age was 27.8 (1.3) weeks and the mean (SD) weight was 965 (202) grams. Babies were randomised at a mean (SD) age of 226 (81) minutes and at a mean (SD) interval of 50 (42) minutes after surfactant administration. The primary outcomes of the study were the ventilatory pressures required and oxygenation status during ventilation. Secondary outcomes included mortality, chronic lung disease and duration of mechanical ventilation. </P>
<P>In the experimental group TGI was achieved via a specially constructed ETT with eight secondary lumens in the wall of the ETT. The secondary lumens allow continuous gas flow of 0.5 L/min to produce TGI (6 lumens) and pressure monitoring (1 lumen) - one lumen is left free to use for the introduction of surfactant. A pump is required to draw warmed humidified gases from the inspiratory line for TGI. A separate computerised monitoring system is also needed to monitor pressure at the distal ETT to enable emergency cut-off of the TGI flow with any abnormal rise in intratracheal pressure (to prevent dangerous lung hyperinflation). TGI was used in this group of infants until extubation. TGI was discontinued during any periods of high-frequency ventilation. In both groups conventional mechanical ventilation (with or without TGI) was continued if the oxygenation index remained within the range of two to 12. An oxygenation index of &gt;12 resulted in a switch to high-frequency ventilation. Infants were weaned from ventilation when the ventilatory rate was below 30 breaths per minute and the oxygenation index was less than two.</P>
<P>In response to our request, the study investigators provided unpublished data for some outcomes not included in the primary report (<LINK REF="STD-Dassieu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dassieu 2000</LINK>) including the total duration of respiratory support, oxygen therapy and hospital stay. They also provided data on neurodevelopmental outcomes (cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, visual impairment and/or developmental delay); however, the details of exact definitions and timing of assessments are not clear and these outcomes have not been included in this review. Other data were published as medians and the study investigators have provided the data as means and standard deviations.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In Dassieu et al's study (<LINK REF="STD-Dassieu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dassieu 2000</LINK>):<BR/>- treatment allocation was randomised (exact method not stated);<BR/>- treatment allocation was concealed using 'sealed envelopes';<BR/>- treatment was not blinded - however in both groups ventilation settings were adjusted according to a predefined protocol to target set oxygen saturation and PCO2; and there were predefined criteria for weaning ventilation and extubation;<BR/>- follow-up was not complete - 41 patients were randomised and there were seven (17%) post-randomisation exclusions. Three of these exclusions were because of technical difficulties with the equipment which prevented commencement of TGI; therefore, analysis is not an 'intention to treat' analysis. Follow-up rates for the remaining 34 infants were generally better than 90% (except for ROP and occurrence of severe hypo- or hypercapnia); <BR/>- most of the published outcomes were not assessed by blinded evaluators. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review is limited in its scope given that only one study was identified which met the inclusion criteria. The single included study (<LINK REF="STD-Dassieu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dassieu 2000</LINK>) was a well conducted randomised controlled trial with only one moderately worrisome methodological shortcoming - the post-randomisation exclusions (although the proportion is &lt;20% of those randomised). The study was a small study with only 34 subjects randomised and followed-up. Therefore, whilst most of the comparisons favour the treatment group, only two outcomes, both related to duration of mechanical ventilation, reached statistical significance. The potential for type 2 error is considerable and the 95% confidence intervals are wide.</P>
<P>Nevertheless this study provides some evidence that TGI may be useful in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation for infants &lt;30 weeks gestation with hyaline membrane disease. It is important to note, however, that the total duration of respiratory support (i.e. conventional ventilation, high frequency ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure) was six days longer in the treatment group although this difference was not statistically significant. The duration of hospital stay was reduced in the treatment group by 10 days but this also did not reach statistical significance. Much larger studies would be required to determine whether the advantage of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation is not lost by an increased total duration of respiratory support, or augmented by a reduction in hospital stay. Benefits also need to be weighed against an intervention that is technically demanding, requires additional specialised equipment and may add considerably to the cost of ventilation. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence from a single small RCT that TGI may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants - although the data from this single small study do not give sufficient evidence to support the introduction of TGI into clinical practice. The technical requirements for performing TGI (as performed in the single included study) are great, and there is no statistically significant reduction in the total duration of respiratory support or hospital stay. TGI cannot be recommended for general use at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Appropriately sized RCTs are required to determine whether the advantage of TGI in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation is not lost by an increased total duration of respiratory support, or augmented by a reduction in hospital stay. Future studies should also investigate the effects on long term neuro-developmental outcomes (i.e. cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, visual impairment and/or developmental delay) to determine that any short term gains are not lost with an increased incidence of disability in survivors.</P>
