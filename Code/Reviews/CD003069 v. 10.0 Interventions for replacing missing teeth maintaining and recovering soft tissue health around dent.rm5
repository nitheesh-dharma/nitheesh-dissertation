<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-27 10:40:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth can be replaced by dental implants. However, keeping the gums around the implants healthy is important, as they can be negatively affected by dental plaque and its induced inflammation. Prevention of this may include daily implant cleaning techniques by patients and regular cleaning by dental professionals. Antibacterial mouthrinses may help reduce plaque and bleeding around dental implants, but there is no evidence that powered toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes or that brushing with a certain gel or dentifrice is better than another. Among the professionally administered treatments there is no evidence that phosphoric acid is more effective than scaling and polishing, that chlorhexidine enclosed in the inner part of implants is superior to physiologic solution or that a topical antibiotic inserted submucosally is better than a chlorhexidine gel. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-13 17:48:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and relevant review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of all identified RCTs, to more than 55 oral implant manufacturers and to an Internet discussion group to find unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restrictions were applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 2 June 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing agents or interventions for maintaining or recovering healthy tissues around dental implants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as random-effects models using standardised mean differences for continuous data and risk ratios for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-07 11:48:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials compared interventions for maintaining soft tissue health around implants and a further six trials compared interventions to recover soft tissue health where there was evidence of peri-implant mucositis. No statistically significant differences were found between the effectiveness of powered versus manual toothbrushes for either maintaining or recovering soft tissue health. There was no statistically significant difference found between different types of self administered antimicrobials for maintaining soft tissue health (hyaluronic acid gel compared to chlorhexidine gel, amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash) and triclosan dentifrice compared to sodium fluoride dentifrice showed no statistically significant difference in recovering soft tissue health. However chlorhexidine irrigation was more effective in reducing plaque and marginal bleeding scores compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash and Listerine mouthwash was found to be statistically significantly better than placebo with regard to reducing mean plaque scores and marginal bleeding scores. When interventions administered by dental professional were compared there was no statistically significant difference found between chlorhexidine and physiologic solutions as irrigants at second stage surgery to maintain health of soft tissues. In patients with peri-implant mucositis two trials evaluated interventions performed by dental professionals. There was no statistically significant difference between mechanical debridement followed by either minocycline or chlorhexidine gel, or between debridement with a titanium curette compared to an ultrasonic debridement tool.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-27 10:40:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was only low quality evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues. The included RCTs had short follow-up periods and few subjects and although overall the risk of bias of the studies was either low or unclear, only single trials were available for each outcome. There was no reliable evidence as to which regimens are most effective for long term maintenance. This should not be interpreted as meaning that current maintenance regimens are ineffective. There was weak evidence that antibacterial mouthrinses are effective in reducing plaque and marginal bleeding around implants. More RCTs should be conducted in this area. In particular, there is a definite need for trials powered to find possible differences, using primary outcome measures and with much longer follow up. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-08 09:54:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-18 16:03:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with removable dentures or fixed bridges to allow for restoration of masticatory and phonetic function, as well as aesthetics. In 1977, Brånemark presented his research work carried out over 10 years showing that bone can grow intimately onto the surface of titanium implants (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). The now well-accepted concept, termed osseointegration, has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 30 years. A multitude of implant designs have been marketed since, and the clinical situations in which osseointegrated implant retained prostheses are used have expanded enormously.</P>
<P>One of the key factors for the long term success of dental implants is the maintenance of healthy tissues around them. With one-stage implant placement and with immediately loaded implants, maintenance begins in the earliest stages of implant treatment.<BR/>A cause-effect relationship between bacterial plaque accumulation and the development of inflammatory changes in the soft tissues surrounding dental implants has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Pontoriero-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pontoriero 1994</LINK>). The reversible inflammatory reaction in the soft tissues surrounding a functioning implant is called peri-implant mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Albrektsson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrektsson 1994</LINK>) and it can be defined as a chronic plaque-induced infection of the marginal peri-implant soft tissues without appreciable bone loss (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). If this condition is left untreated, it may lead to the progressive destruction of the tissues supporting an implant (peri-implantitis) and ultimately to its failure (<LINK REF="REF-Mombelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mombelli 1999</LINK>). In the literature data regarding biological complications are underreported (<LINK REF="REF-Berglundh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berglundh 2002</LINK>). Peri-implant mucositis can be a common situation in subjects not following a proper maintenance programme: a long term (9 to 14 years) follow-up study on Brånemark implants (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>) reported the presence of peri-implant mucositis lesions in 76.6% of the subjects. It is important to institute an effective preventive regimen (supportive therapy) for maintaining healthy soft tissues around dental implants and when a pathologic condition is diagnosed, a therapeutic intervention should be initiated as soon as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). Different maintenance regimens and treatment strategies for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis have been suggested, however it is unclear which are the most effective (<LINK REF="REF-Orton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general similar oral hygiene methods are advocated for teeth and implants and they can be self or professionally administered or both. One of the main concerns for dental implants, derived from in vitro studies, is that the metal instruments used for cleaning root surfaces can damage the metallic surface of abutments or implants, thus increasing the chance for bacterial colonisation (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson_x002d_Neal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson-Neal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCollum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCollum 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speelman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speelman 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>For daily self administered maintenance procedures, various mechanical means for bacterial plaque removal have been proposed including soft toothbrushes, nylon coated interproximal brushes and specially designed cleaning instruments made in hard plastic to avoid the roughening and metal 'contamination' of the implant-abutment surface (<LINK REF="REF-Balshi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshi 1986</LINK>), powered toothbrushes and flossing cords to facilitate cleaning in less accessible areas. Adjunctive twice-daily rinsing with antimicrobial agents such as chlorhexidine or Listerine have been recommended for individuals with physical impairment. Powered subgingival irrigation with antimicrobials has also been proposed as an adjunct to routine brushing by the patient.</P>
<P>Professionally administered maintenance consists of removal of dental plaque and calculus from the implant-abutment surface. This can be accomplished in several ways, but special procedures have been recommended for dental implants, such as polishing with rubber cup and fine abrasive polishing paste (flour of pumice, Nupro fine, tin oxide), subgingival irrigation with antimicrobial agents, phosphoric acid gel application. Adjunctive use of local or systemic antibiotics have been advocated in the case of deep pockets (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 2000</LINK>). Plastic scalers were also recommended to avoid galvanic corrosion and contamination of metallic implants (<LINK REF="REF-Dmytryk-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dmytryk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bragger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bragger 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review was published to investigate whether more than 10 years of maintenance procedures could prevent biological complications and implant loss (<LINK REF="REF-Hultin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultin 2007</LINK>). Nine uncontrolled studies were included with inconclusive results. Another literature review (<LINK REF="REF-Renvert-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renvert 2008</LINK>) on non surgical treatment of mucositis and peri-implantitis had different aims and used different criteria for inclusion of the studies.</P>

<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there was insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports, containing names of the authors, institutions, journal of publication and results, obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently by two review authors with expertise in this content area, to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent validity assessment and data extraction. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table, and reasons for exclusion recorded.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-06-27 10:40:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were extracted independently by two review authors who were both content area experts, using specially designed data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as required before use. Any disagreement was discussed and a third review author consulted where necessary. All authors were contacted for clarification or missing information. Data were excluded until further clarification was available if agreement could not be reached.</P>
<P>For each trial the following data were recorded.<BR/>Year of publication, country of origin and source of study funding.<BR/>Details of the participants including demographic characteristics.<BR/>Details on the type of intervention.<BR/>Details of the outcomes reported, including method of assessment and time intervals.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-07 11:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For any relevant studies identified, two review authors independently graded the relevant trials following the domain-based evaluation described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.0.2 (updated September 2009) (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=8D67D37282E26AA201AA9B4D54ED9EBC&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2009#REF-Higgins-2009">Higgins 2009</A>). The review authors then compared evaluations and discussed and resolved any disagreements.<BR/>An assessment of the overall risk of bias involved the consideration of the relative importance of different domains and studies were to be categorised as low, high or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>The review authors were to assess the following domains as 'Yes' (i.e. low risk of bias), 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias) or 'No' (i.e. high risk of bias):</P>
<P>(1) adequate sequence generation;</P>
<P>(2) allocation concealment;</P>
<P>(3) blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors);</P>
<P>(4) incomplete outcome data addressed;</P>
<P>(5) free of selective outcome reporting;</P>
<P>(6) free of other bias.</P>
<P>Risk of bias were categorised according to the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more criteria were assessed as unclear; or</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The review authors reported these assessments for included studies in a risk of bias in included studies table in Review Manager (RevMan).</P>
<P>Further quality assessment was carried out to assess whether a sample size calculation had been performed, definitions of exclusion/inclusion criteria and comparability of control and treatment groups at entry. The quality assessment criteria were pilot tested using several articles.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-06-24 09:37:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as odds ratios (OR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group using mean differences and 95% CIs. Appropriate data were extracted from the split-mouth studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lesaffre-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesaffre 2009</LINK>) and the generic inverse variance method was used to enter this into Revman.</P>

<P>Considering the 6 domains which were assessed, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ciancio-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ciancio 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Araujo-Nobre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Araujo Nobre 2007</LINK> ) were considered to be of low risk of bias for all outcomes. The overall risk of bias was considered unclear in eight studies and in one study it was considered high.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>) reported on sample size calculation; assuming a mean difference of 0.6 mm in clinical measurements of probing depth between groups, these authors calculated that 18 individuals would be required in each group to give adequate power. However the actual statistical calculation was not included. At the end of the trial 17 and 14 patients were analysed in each group, so it is likely that the study was underpowered.</P>

<P>A division was made between trials dealing with maintaining soft tissue health and trials concerned with recovering soft tissue health around implants where mucositis lesions were present. Healthy and diseased soft tissues surrounding dental implants represent different clinical conditions and it would be useful for the clinician to know the best way to manage each condition.</P>
<P>Five trials compared different interventions for maintaining soft tissue health; three evaluating patient administered interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horwitz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horwitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Araujo-Nobre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Araujo Nobre 2007</LINK>); and two evaluating interventions administered by dental professionals (<LINK REF="STD-Strooker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Strooker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groenendijk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Groenendijk 2004</LINK>) .</P>
<P>There was no difference between powered versus manual toothbrushes after 6 weeks with regard to mean plaques scores and probing pocket depths in one study assessed as being at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>). Two trials evaluated self administered antimicrobials. There was no difference in plaque, marginal bleeding or probing pocket depth between hyaluronic acid and chlorhexidene gels after 6 months in a single study judged to be at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-de-Araujo-Nobre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Araujo Nobre 2007</LINK>). Another study, judged to be at low risk of bias compared amine fluoride/stannous fluoride and chlorhexidine mouthwashes and found no difference in the outcomes of implant failure or tooth staining after 3 months (<LINK REF="STD-Horwitz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horwitz 2005</LINK>). Two trials evaluated interventions administered by dental professionals. In one trial judged to be at high risk of bias there was no difference between phosphoric acid etching and mechanical debridement after 5 months for the outcomes of plaque and probing pocket depth and both interventions took a similar time to administer (<LINK REF="STD-Strooker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Strooker 1998</LINK>). The final trial in this group, judged to be at high risk of bias, compared the use of chlorhexidine and physiologic solutions to irrigate the inner part of the implants at second stage surgery and found no difference in plaque levels after 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Groenendijk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Groenendijk 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining six trials compared different interventions for the recovery of soft tissue health in patients who had signs of mucositis. Four studies compared patient administered interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Ciancio-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ciancio 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Felo 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramberg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ramberg 2009</LINK>) and two evaluated interventions administered by dental professionals (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial, judged to be at high risk of bias, compared powered 'sonic' toothbrush with a manual toothbrush and found no difference in plaque, changes in probing pocket depth and ease of use after 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1998</LINK>). Three trials evaluated patient administered antimicrobials; mouthwash versus placebo, subgingival irrigation solutions and dentifrices were each compared in a single trial.</P>
<P>The use of Listerine mouthwash resulted in a statistically significant reduction in both plaque and marginal bleeding in a trial at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ciancio-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ciancio 1995)</LINK>. Chlorhexidine irrigation resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean plaque scores and marginal bleeding scores compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash in one trial at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Felo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Felo 1997</LINK>). There was no difference in plaque reduction either between groups or from baseline to 6 months in a trial comparing triclosan and sodium fluoride dentifrices, in a trial judged to be at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ramberg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ramberg 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final two trials evaluated mechanical debridement procedures undertaken by dental professionals. One trial, at low risk of bias, compared mechanical debridement plus either minocycline or chlorhexidine gel and found no difference in the outcomes of gum soreness at 10 days or plaque levels or probing pocket depth after a year (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2004</LINK>). The other trial compared two mechanical debridement tools, either titanium curette or ultrasonic debridement and found no difference between the groups in plaque index or pocket probing depth after 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>). However there was a statistically significant difference in plaque index between baseline and 6 months in both groups but no difference in probing pocket depth in this study judged to be at low risk of bias. These two studies analysed treatments of incipient peri-implant infections. Since inclusion criteria was bone loss <U>&lt;</U> 3 mm compared to the placement of the prosthesis 10 to 12 years before (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2004</LINK>) or bone loss less than &lt; 2.5 mm (mean loss 1.5 mm; SD ±1.2) (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>), both studies were included in this review and not in the review on peri-implantitis (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2010</LINK>). A bone remodelling to about the first thread is accepted around Brånemark implants and so the authors agreed they have treated mucositis cases. In both studies mean pockets depths were around 4 mm and around 5 mm for the worst sites, and oral hygiene remained poor in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>) and this can partly explain the results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>Reporting of adverse effects and patient preferences was inconsistent and there was insufficient data to quantify these outcomes. Side effects should be reported and they can help clinicians in choosing between treatments with similar effectiveness. Efficacy should be evaluated first. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Horwitz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horwitz 2005</LINK>) reported less changes in taste and more patient desire for future use for an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse versus a chlorhexidine one, but we had no data on its efficacy since plaque and inflammation parameters were not investigated. If two treatments are equally effective, the more patient friendly one should be used: since the application of 35% phosphoric acid had the same efficacy of titanium curettes, but produced pain, the second procedure should be chosen (<LINK REF="STD-Strooker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Strooker 1998</LINK>). Patient preference and ease of maintenance should be considered too, since both factors can play an important role in patient compliance. At the same time patient's preference is not an indication of the efficacy of an instrument: there was no evidence that sonic brush was superior to manual brushing, even if patients liked it more (<LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1998</LINK>), nor that a powered toothbrush was more effective than a manual one (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>). The follow-up period in the trials ranged between 6 weeks and 6 months and this was probably not long enough to detect a difference in implant failure rate should such a difference exist.</P>
<P>Chlorexidine is the most effective antiplaque agent to date. However in its use as a mouthrinse, several side effects have been reported: brown discolorations, taste perturbation, oral mucosal erosion and enhanced supragingival calculus formation (<LINK REF="REF-Addy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addy 2003</LINK>). Even if concerns have been raised about the cancerogenicity of mouthrinses containing alcohol (such as Listerine), up to now there is no evidence of a link between oral cancer and alcohol containing mouthwashes (<LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 2009</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-07-07 14:43:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though maintenance of peri-implant tissues is widely considered an important part of the treatment of patients with dental implants, few randomised controlled trials (RCTs), known to provide the most reliable level of evidence (Higgins 2006), have addressed this topic. Only 11 RCTs could be included in this review and no meta-analysis could be conducted as each trial assessed different interventions. Only one trial compared an active intervention. The remaining ten trials compared different interventions head to head.</P>
<P>We identified a further five RCTs which were never published as full articles, but only in the form of conference abstracts. Due to insufficient information presented in the abstracts and the lack of author's reply to our request to supply missing data, we were not able to include these studies in this review. The reasons why these RCTs were not published as full papers can only be speculated upon. It is important to stress that the results of all trials, either positive or negative, should be properly shared with the rest of the community.</P>
<P>Seven more studies, identified in our search, had problems with the way data were presented, and were therefore excluded from this systematic review. In some cases data were reported with the implant, rather than the patient, as the unit of measurement: the clustering of the implants within a patient was not taken into account in the analysis of data presented in the trial report. In others no outcomes related to presence of mucosal inflammation were given. Ideally, the primary outcome measure of interest would have been implant failure, but surrogate outcomes defined as measures of the disease process were included since they may detect earlier pathological changes allowing an early rescue treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Furberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2001</LINK>). Among surrogate outcomes it is likely that marginal bone level changes on intraoral radiographs taken with the parallel technique are the most reliable for detecting loss of bone support (for a review <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998</LINK>). However, to have meaningful results, assessment of bone level changes (and implant failures) can be applied only to trials of sufficient duration (years).</P>
<P>For short term trials parameters such as plaque and marginal bleeding index may be more appropriate. Since soft tissue health should be evaluated, marginal bleeding (an indicator of plaque-induced inflammation) and plaque (the main causal factor for peri-implant soft tissues diseases) should be considered. The use of probing pocket depths and clinical 'attachment' levels may not provide as accurate results as radiographic assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schou 2002</LINK>), thus being of less importance in clinical trials. However, such parameters could be of great help to clinicians for early identification of potential problems during routine maintenance procedures. Microbiological data can help in understanding clinical data, but the latter should be reported. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Groenendijk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Groenendijk 2004</LINK>) chlorhexidine solution inside the inner part of the two piece implant was effective in reducing the bacteria counts at 6 weeks inside the implant, but not plaque or clinical signs of inflammation (gingival index) around the implant itself. More careful design, analysis and reporting of RCTs on oral implants are needed (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2001a</LINK>).</P>

<P>The risk of bias of the 11 trials included in this review was assessed as being high in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Strooker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Strooker 1998</LINK>), low in only 2 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ciancio-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ciancio 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Araujo-Nobre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Araujo Nobre 2007</LINK> ) and unclear in the remaining eight trials. This is frequently due to poor reporting of the trials and/or unwillingness of authors to supply the missing information in response to our requests.</P>
<P>Peri-implantitis has been shown to develop after several years (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>) and implants are expected to function in the mouth for decades. Only one of the trials included had a follow-up of 1 year (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2004</LINK>), while the other studies ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months. Longer follow-up studies on the effectiveness of maintenance interventions are needed.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>) referred to a sample size calculations being conducted to determine the number of patients needed to detect a clinically important effect at a specified level of statistical significance, but the final number of patients analysed in this trial was fewer that the calculated minimum, suggesting that this trial was underpowered.</P>
<P>It is difficult to determine the extent to which the results of the included trials can be generalised to other populations. The results obtained were within the strict protocols of clinical trials. Many of the patients attended frequent professional maintenance appointments, where professional cleaning was performed and oral hygiene instruction reinforced. The effect of these additional procedures, which are seldom used in routine clinical practice, may have influenced the levels of oral hygiene obtained. It may also be possible that increased contact with dental health professionals may have resulted in oral hygiene being increased to a higher overall level at which it may be difficult to see differences among the tested interventions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-07 13:37:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was little evidence for the most effective interventions for maintaining and recovering health around peri-implant tissues. There was some evidence from two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that Listerine mouthwash, used twice a day for 30 seconds, as an adjunct to routine oral hygiene, gave a reduction of 54% in plaque and 34% in marginal bleeding compared with a placebo and that chlorexidine irrigations were effective in reducing plaque formation by 20% and marginal peri-implant bleeding by 35% versus a chlorexidine mouthwash. No evidence was found that the use of powered or sonic toothbrushes was superior to manual toothbrushing, though patients liked the sonic brush more, and that brushing with a hyaluronic gel was better than with a chlorhexidine gel or that using a triclosan dentifrice was superior to a fluoride one. There was no evidence of any clinical advantage regarding the use of phosphoric etching gel over mechanical debridement and polishing, of chlorhexidine gel over a physiologic solution enclosed in implants, of topical minocycline over chlorhexidine gel and of ultrasonics over manual instruments in peri-implant pockets. When an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF<SUB>2</SUB>) mouthrinse was compared with a chlorhexidine one, no statistically significant differences were found for implant failures and staining index while patients preferred and had less taste change with the AmF/SnF<SUB>2</SUB> mouthrinse. These findings were based on trials having in general short follow-up periods (6 months or less; only one study with 1 year follow-up) and limited numbers of subjects. There was not any reliable evidence for which are the most effective maintenance regimens in a long term perspective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-07 13:38:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More RCTs should be conducted in this area. In particular, there is a definite need for trials powered to detect a difference, using outcome measures such as implant failure, change in radiographic bone level, marginal bleeding and plaque, with data taken at patient level and with follow-up of several years. We do acknowledge that such trials will be expensive and difficult to conduct but they are the only ones able to provide a reliable answer. Simple methods to implement personal and professional oral hygiene should be studied first (different types of hand curettes, different types of brushes, etc). Such trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).</P>
