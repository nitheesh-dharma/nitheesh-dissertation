Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a common pre-cancerous condition of the cervix associated with HPV (the human papillomavirus), which can occur in anyone but is commonly found in younger women who wish to maintain their fertility and treatment often involves surgical excision. CIN can progress to invasive cancer of the cervix. CIN is identified by screening and can be treated with surgery to the cervix either by removal with surgical excision or destruction of the cells covering the cervix such as with laser therapy, heating, or freezing. While this is effective in the majority of cases, the surgery can cause immediate unwanted effects, such as bleeding and infection, or later complications including difficulty with menses due to scarring of the cervix and early (premature) labour.</P><P>NSAIDs have been found to prevent the development of cancer of the large bowel and other organs, but with some unwanted side effects especially on the heart and blood vessels. Although rofecoxib, used in one of these studies, was withdrawn from the market in 2004, it may shed light on the feasibility of treatment with other NSAIDs.</P><P>We wanted to discover whether the use of NSAIDs for women with CIN could promote regression or prevent progression to cervical cancer without undue risk or side effects.</P><P><B>The aim of the review</B><BR/>To identify the utility of treating CIN with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as celecoxib to cause regression of the abnormal findings and avoid surgical procedures.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B><BR/>We identified three randomised studies up to August 2017, including 171 women over the age of 18 years, with moderate or severe CIN. The trials ran from June 2005 to April 2012, June 2002 to October 2003, and May to October 2004. One of them was discontinued before it was completed. The women were given either celecoxib or rofecoxib versus a placebo (sugar tablet) daily by mouth for a period of three to six months.</P><P><B>Key Results</B><BR/>With the addition of the third trial to this review, there is now a sufficient number of patients in the review to conclude that NSAIDs have minimal effect over placebo in causing regression of CIN. No patients progressed to invasive cervical cancer, and overall, the drug was well-tolerated compared to placebo.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence </B><BR/>The studies appear to have been well-conducted. There are some questions related to the quality of evidence in relation to concealment and women dropping out of the study before completion of assigned medications. We therefore concluded that the certainty (quality) of the evidence was moderate. There was insufficient information to assess accuracy of the reporting of information. It is possible that there are other incomplete and unreported studies that have not been identified.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B><BR/>The literature available at this time suggests that there are no convincing data to suggest NSAIDs as a treatment for CIN.<BR/></P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-17 14:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:35:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2014, Issue 4. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) precedes the development of invasive carcinoma of the cervix.

The study with rofecoxib was discontinued when the medicine was withdrawn from the market in 2004. The trials ran from June 2005 to April 2012, June 2002 to October 2003, and May to October 2004, respectively. We have chosen to include the data from the rofecoxib study as outcomes may be similar when other such NSAIDs are utilised.</P><P>Partial or complete regression of CIN 2 or CIN 3 occurred in 31 out of 70 (44%) in the treatment arms and 19 of 62 (31%) in the placebo arms (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.27; P value 0.10), three studies, 132 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Complete regression of CIN 2 or CIN 3 occurred in 15 of 62 (24%) of those receiving celecoxib versus 10 of 54 (19%) of those receiving placebo (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.67; P value 0.45, two studies, 116 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Partial regression of CIN 2 or CIN 3 occurred in 14 of 62 (23%) of those receiving celecoxib versus 8 of 54 (15%) of those receiving placebo (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.4; P value 0.26), two studies, 116 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).</P><P>Progression to a higher grade of CIN, but not to invasive cancer, occurred in one of 12 (8%) of those receiving celecoxib and two of 13 (15%) receiving placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.24; P value 0.60, one study, 25 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported no cases of progression to invasive cancer within the timeframe of the study. No toxicity was reported in the two original articles. The trial added in this update had one Grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse effect in the treatment arm, but otherwise had similar Grade 1 to 2 side effects between treatment and placebo groups. Although the studies were well-conducted and randomised, some risk of bias was detected in all studies. Furthermore, the duration of the studies was short, which may mask identifying progression to cancer.</P><P>The addition of the trial in this update quadrupled the number of patients in the original review and was a well-designed multicentre trial thus, increasing the overall certainty of evidence from very low to moderate for this review.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:37:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>There are currently no convincing data to support a benefit for NSAIDs in the treatment of CIN.

In two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating celecoxib for the prevention of colorectal adenomas, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and death) were increased 12.7% in patients taking celecoxib, and reduced by 4.4% in those taking aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Arber-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arber 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertagnolli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertagnolli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2006</LINK>). These patients had a median age of 59 to 61, were treated for relatively long periods of time (one to three years) and many had pre-existing cardiovascular disease. While these patients represent a different population than most who would be treated for CIN, cardiovascular events remain a concern with the use of COX-2 inhibitors. Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, which was used by one of the studies in this review, was withdrawn from the market in 2004 for such concerns.</P><P>It should be noted that many women may experience regression of CIN without treatment: CIN 2 regression is estimated in around 50% of women within six months (<LINK REF="REF-Bleecker-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleecker 2014</LINK>) and CIN 3 regression in approximately 30% of women within six months. In a RCT investigating medical treatment for CIN 2/CIN 3, 31% in the placebo arm had complete histologic regression in six months (<LINK REF="REF-Follen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follen 2001</LINK>), whilst in another similar study 32% of CIN 2/CIN 3 lesions regressed to a lower level of CIN in three months without treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). Differences in regression may be related to the subtype of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) as HPV-16 and HPV-33 are less likely to be spontaneously cleared and more likely to progress to higher CIN (<LINK REF="REF-Jaisamrarn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaisamrarn 2013</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-03 08:23:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>The potential use of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, to induce regression or prevent the progression of CIN to invasive carcinoma is an exciting prospect.

Regression was defined as reduction in the grade of dysplasia by at least one grade (CIN 3 to CIN 2, CIN 2 to CIN 1, and CIN 1 to no dysplasia).</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:33:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Women 18 years of age and over with an initial diagnosis of CIN.</P></CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:38:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors alone, by any route in an outpatient setting.</P></CRIT_INTERVENTIONS><CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:38:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:38:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><UL><LI>Progression of CIN to higher grades of CIN</LI><LI>Progression of CIN to invasive carcinoma</LI><LI>Regression of CIN</LI></UL></CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY><CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:35:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Adverse events related to treatment.</P></CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY></CRIT_OUTCOMES></SELECTION_CRITERIA><SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-22 14:59:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>We searched for papers in all languages and planned to have them translated as necessary.</P><ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2018-01-22 14:59:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>For the original query, we searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group (CGCRG), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 11) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>); MEDLINE (1946 up to Novemeber, 2013) (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>); and Embase (1980 up to 2013, week 48) (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).

Although there are sound theoretical reasons why non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) might have an effect on prevention of progression of CIN (as detailed in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>), the findings of this review are not surprising in view of the small size and quality of the published data that were identified. The questions can only be resolved through the performance of appropriately designed clinical trials; such trials are difficult to perform in this setting.</P><P>It is important to note that any therapeutic benefit demonstrated as a result of further clinical trials will need to be weighed against the possible adverse effects of both NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors that have been identified in large chemoprevention studies for colorectal adenomas.</P><P>In light of the causal association of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection with the development and progression of CIN (<LINK REF="REF-Munoz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munoz 2006</LINK>), and the high negative predictive value of clearance of high-risk HPV infection following treatment, such testing might be an important factor to incorporate in future studies (<LINK REF="REF-Paraskevaidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paraskevaidis 2004</LINK>). However, HPV-16 status did not seem to contribute to celecoxib response with 36.2% and 38.5% responding with and without the virus in the newly reviewed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rader-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Rader 2017</LINK>).</P><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:39:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>We found no convincing evidence to support the use of NSAIDS in CIN 2/3 to induce complete or partial regression, or to prevent progression to higher grades.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-30 01:21:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This update includes recently published data which adds to the body of literature that unfortunately, while well-tolerated, NSAIDs do not prove effective in the treatment of CIN significantly more than the disease is naturally cleared while on placebo. With the addition of this larger trial, the authors feel that this topic has been adequately explored. </P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:41:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>The trials in our original review appear to have been well-conducted although they were of small size and one was closed early due to withdrawal of the study agent. With the addition of the multi-institution randomised trial in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Rader-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Rader 2017</LINK>), we have upgraded the evidence to moderate certainty according to GRADE criteria given that the addition of the new trial quadrupled the number of patients in our original review and was a well-designed multi-centre trial (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Given that the natural history of CIN lends to some regression without intervention and no convincing evidence that NSAIDs have a significant impact over placebo, we do not feel that further research would alter the conclusions.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:39:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>We undertook a comprehensive search to identify eligible studies. Three review authors extracted data independently. It is possible that there are other incomplete and unreported studies that have not been identified. We chose to retain data from the use of rofecoxib (removed from the market in 2004) in the review as findings may be similar to other COX-2 inhibitors.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:39:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>We did not identify any relevant studies or reviews.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:41:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:41:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>In this updated review, there is sufficient evidence to determine that, while overall safe and well-tolerated, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are not efficacious in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The addition of the multi-centre, randomised trial in this review to the two small short-term studies reviewed previously now provides high-quality support for these conclusions. For those patients strongly opposed to surgery, an NSAID trial would not be unreasonable but close surveillance should be implemented with surgical intervention if no response is achieved.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:41:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in cancer development and the interactions of NSAIDs with these pathways could lead to more effective chemo-preventive agents without substantial toxicity, and should be pursued. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to promote use of NSAIDs for treatment of CIN, further studies may support a medical management approach, and save women (especially in their child-bearing years) unnecessary procedures, particularly as personalised, targeted treatment is being emphasised in medicine.

Histological responses were present in 20/50 (40%) of the celecoxib arm versus 14/41 (34.1%) in the placebo group. With an ITT analysis, response rates were 20/67 (29.9%) and 14/63 (22.2%) for treatment and placebo. 31/81 (38%) response was noted if the lesion was less than 50% of the cervix versus 3/10 (30%) if greater than 50%.

Patients with high serum VEGF levels were more like to response to celecoxib versus placebo at 47.4% and 14.3%.</P></CHAR_OUTCOMES><CHAR_NOTES/></INCLUDED_CHAR><FOOTNOTES><P>ALT: alanine aminotransferase<BR/>AST: aspartate aminotransferase<BR/>CIN: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia<BR/>HPV: human papillomavirus<BR/>ITT: intention-to-treat<BR/>LEEP: loop electrosurgical excision procedure<BR/>NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent<BR/>VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor<BR/></P></FOOTNOTES></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES><CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" SORT_BY="STUDY"><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" STUDY_ID="STD-Ferrandina-2003"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Laboratory study of celecoxib in cervical cancer cell lines</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2013-05-12 14:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Herrera-2007"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2013-05-12 14:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Phase I-II study of celecoxib with chemoradiation in patients with cervical cancer</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" STUDY_ID="STD-Mitchell-1995"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Review of chemoprevention trials and surrogate end point biomarkers in the cervix</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><EXCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" STUDY_ID="STD-Vlastos-2003"><CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 09:40:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Review of biomarkers and their use in cervical cancer chemoprevention</P></CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION></EXCLUDED_CHAR><FOOTNOTES/></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES><CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES SORT_BY="STUDY" USER_DEF_1_ENABLED="NO" USER_DEF_2_ENABLED="NO" USER_DEF_3_ENABLED="NO"><FOOTNOTES/></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES><CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-10-24 19:41:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" SORT_BY="STUDY" USER_DEF_1_ENABLED="YES" USER_DEF_1_NAME="User defined 1" USER_DEF_2_ENABLED="NO" USER_DEF_3_ENABLED="NO"><FOOTNOTES><P>ALT: alanine aminotransferase<BR/>AST: aspartate aminotransferase<BR/>CIN: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia<BR/>COX: cyclooxygenase<BR/>NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent<BR/>ULN: upper limit of normal<BR/>WBC: white blood cells<BR/></P></FOOTNOTES></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_STUDIES><QUALITY_ITEMS MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><QUALITY_ITEM CORE_ITEM="YES" ID="QIT-01" LEVEL="STUDY" MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" NO="1"><NAME>Random sequence generation (selection bias)</NAME><DESCRIPTION><P>Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence</P></DESCRIPTION><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" RESULT="YES" STUDY_ID="STD-Farley-2006"><DESCRIPTION><P>Randomisation was performed using a computer generator Random Allocation Software, which randomised each participant to a single treatment, by using the method of randomly permuted blocks</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" RESULT="YES" STUDY_ID="STD-Hefler-2006"><DESCRIPTION><P>Participants were randomised using a random number sequence with permuted block size of 12</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2017-10-30 03:26:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" RESULT="YES" STUDY_ID="STD-Rader-2017"><DESCRIPTION><P>Patients randomised in 1:1 fashion.</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA></QUALITY_ITEM><QUALITY_ITEM CORE_ITEM="YES" ID="QIT-02" LEVEL="STUDY" MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" NO="2"><NAME>Allocation concealment (selection bias)</NAME><DESCRIPTION><P>Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment</P></DESCRIPTION><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2018-01-17 13:42:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" RESULT="YES" STUDY_ID="STD-Farley-2006"><DESCRIPTION><P>Allocation concealment was accomplished by the Department of Pharmacy.
