<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-16 17:21:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>When performing a caesarean, several layers of the mother's abdomen need to be cut to reach the baby. After the baby's birth, the layers need to be closed again. This review looked at different ways of closing the skin layer after a caesarean. Skin closure can be carried out with stitches that go under the skin, stitches that go over the skin or staples (clips). Suture materials currently available are natural or synthetic, absorbable or non-absorbable, single-filament or braided. Staples are attractive because of the speed of application.</P>
<P>We identified 19 randomized controlled trials and included 11, but only eight contributed data. The most commonly studied methods of skin closure were non-absorbable staples compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Staples were associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and appearance compared with sutures. Non-absorbable staples had an increased risk of skin separation and, therefore, reclosure. Skin separation was defined differently across trials and removal of staples varied from about day three to day seven postoperatively.</P>
<P>There is not enough evidence from the included studies to say which method of closing the caesarean skin incision is superior. Too few trials compared different kinds of sutures. The use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infection was not reported in most trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is a common operation with no agreed upon standard regarding certain operative techniques or materials to use. With regard to skin closure, the skin incision can be re-approximated by a subcuticular suture immediately below the skin layer, by an interrupted suture, or by staples. A great variety of materials and techniques are used for skin closure after caesarean section and there is a need to identify which provide the best outcomes for women.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-15 04:32:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 19 trials and included 11, but only eight trials contributed data. Three trials were not randomized controlled trials; two were ongoing; one study was terminated and the results were not available for review; one is awaiting classification; and one did not compare skin closure materials, but rather suture to suture and drain placement.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two methods of skin closure for caesarean that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with similar incidences of wound infection. Other important secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, were also similar between the groups in women with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, it is important to note, that for both of these outcomes (wound infection and wound complication), staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision, i.e., Pfannenstiel or vertical. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with an increased risk of skin separation, and therefore, reclosure. However, skin separation was variably defined across trials, and most staples were removed before four days postpartum.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>There is currently no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section. Staples are associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and cosmesis compared with sutures, and these two are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure after caesarean section. If staples are removed on day three, there is an increased incidence of skin separation and the need for reclosure compared with absorbable sutures.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-17 10:05:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Caesarean section is the most common major surgery in many developed countries, and is performed on tens of millions of women annually worldwide. It is, therefore, paramount that this laparotomy be performed following the best technique. Several randomized trials have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of many technical aspects of caesarean (<LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Caesareans are started by using a vertical or transverse suprapubic skin incision (a horizontal cut just above the pubic bone), with the Joel-Cohen method preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathai-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathai 2007</LINK>). After the skin incision is made, different techniques may be used to reach the uterus. Some obstetricians dissect their way to the uterus with a knife and scissors, others bluntly tear away the tissues. An opening on the uterus is typically via a low-transverse incision. This incision is extended bluntly with fingers (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2008</LINK>). After delivery of the baby, the placenta should be removed spontaneously, with gentle cord traction and uterine massage (<LINK REF="REF-Anorlu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anorlu 2008</LINK>). External-abdominal repair of the uterus is associated with similar outcomes as intra-abdominal repair (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs_x002d_Jokhan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs-Jokhan 2004</LINK>). Single-layer closure compared with double-layer closure has been associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean blood loss; duration of the operative procedure; and presence of postoperative pain, but there are insufficient data to assess differences in single- versus double-layer closure in terms of long-term outcomes (e.g., chance of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy) (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2008</LINK>). The rectus muscle fascia is repaired next. This layer gives the whole wound its strength. If it is repaired incorrectly, the woman is at risk of developing an incisional hernia. Closure of the subcutaneous fat may reduce wound complications, especially in women with at least 2 cm of fat layer (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-15 12:31:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The skin layer, which is the subject of this review, can be repaired by subcuticular absorbable stitch (immediately below the skin layer), a non-absorbable interrupted stitch (individual stitches, typically placed transdermally), or absorbable or non-absorbable skin staples. A survey of skin closure techniques used in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Tully-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tully 2002</LINK>) showed that the subcuticular skin stitch was the most commonly used (74%) followed by interrupted skin stitch (8%) and others (18%). While this survey suggests little variation in surgical technique within the UK, different situations may apply in other countries.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-15 12:14:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Suture materials currently available are natural or synthetic, absorbable or non-absorbable, single-filament or braided. Until recently, catgut and silk were the two main natural sutures used in obstetrics. Catgut is made by treating strips of a sheep's small intestine with formaldehyde. It is an absorbable suture, but has been withdrawn from use in the UK due to the risk of cross infection with slow viruses. It was rarely used in skin closure.</P>
<P>With a growing choice of techniques and materials to use at skin closure, the effectiveness of the type of stitch and material used is unclear.</P>
<P>In theory, staples are attractive because of speed of application (<LINK REF="REF-Gatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gatt 1985</LINK>) and studies have shown mixed results when comparing wound pain and cosmesis between these two closure techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Eldrup-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eldrup 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaertner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gaertner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranabaldo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranabaldo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rousseau-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rousseau 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>With the wide variety of materials and techniques used at skin closure in caesareans, there is a need to identify which provide the best outcomes for women. This systematic review was conducted to identify evidence regarding the most effective skin closure techniques. Trials from general surgery can provide some information on the possible effects of the use of different techniques and materials, but it is important to analyze these interventions separately for caesareans.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e., where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

This was true even for the subgroup analysis for caesareans performed via Pfannenstiel skin incisions (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.36; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of note, there is significant heterogeneity between the two subgroups in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> with I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 61% and 84%, respectively. Therefore, this suggests that staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of incision, vertical or Pfannenstiel.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant difference with regards to skin separation and requiring reclosure of incision. Incisions closed with staples were more likely to be complicated by separation (RR 3.82; 95% CI 2.05 to 7.12; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and therefore require reclosure (RR 4.98; 95% CI 1.82 to 13.61; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). However, it is important to note that the majority of the studies did not define a minimum width to meet the definition of separation. <LINK REF="STD-Basha-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basha 2010</LINK>, which was the largest of the studies, defined separation as per the patient or medical record; they noted that this varied from small defects in the skin to separation of the entire wound. Also, it is difficult to assess whether the separation preceded another complication such as hematoma, or whether the reverse is true. We are also unable to determine in what percentage the separation could potentially be iatrogenic (as a result of the procedure), e.g., staples were removed early, secondary to suspicion of wound infection. The remainder of the secondary outcomes studied were not significantly different between the groups.</P>
<P>Of note, despite that <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rousseau-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rousseau 2009</LINK> rated pain on 10 cm scales, the pain scale at discharge (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) and pain scale postpartum (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) revealed great statistical heterogeneity (I² values of 88 and 98% respectively). Therefore, we feel that even the random-effects model may not be applicable and that the results of these two studies may be too heterogeneous to be combined.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The two methods of skin closure for caesarean section that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with similar incidences of wound infection. The use of prophylactic antibiotics, known to affect this outcome, was not reported in most trials. Other important secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, were also similar between the groups in women with Pfannenstiel incisions. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with an increased risk of skin separation and, therefore, reclosure. However, skin separation was variably defined across trials. Moreover, removal of staples varied from about day three to day seven postoperatively.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to compare absorbable subcuticular sutures versus non-absorbable interrupted sutures, subcuticular barbed sutures versus subcuticular PDS sutures, absorbable staples versus non-absorbable staples, and absorbable sutures versus non-absorbable sutures. No other trials assessing different comparisons were identified. Therefore, there is also insufficient evidence to compare different kinds of sutures.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:53:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Several outcomes were not reported in any of the published trials: length of stay on readmission, length of scar, cost, maternal length of hospital stay, and presence of hypertrophic scar at one year. There is insufficient evidence to report on women who had preoperative antibiotics, for BMI &gt;= 30 and &lt; 30, and for caesarean prior to labor versus after the onset of labor. It is also impossible to do a subanalysis based on day of removal of staples. Other technical aspects of caesarean can affect wound outcomes. For example, manual versus spontaneous delivery of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Anorlu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anorlu 2008</LINK>) and closure of the subcutaneous space (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004</LINK>).

Therefore, for example, in any of the included studies (except <LINK REF="STD-Gaertner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gaertner 2008</LINK>), a woman with a seroma and hematoma may have been counted as two wound complications, rather than one.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-17 17:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean. Staples are associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and cosmesis compared to sutures; and these two are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure at caesarean. If staples are removed on day three, there is an increased incidence of skin separation and need for reclosure compared to absorbable sutures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-24 04:52:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The evidence suggests that staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of incision, vertical or Pfannenstiel. Additional research is necessary to ascertain whether this is the case. There is still insufficient evidence to determine whether day of staple removal impacts on wound separation. There is also need for future studies that use pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis routinely, spontaneous placental removal, and closure of subcutaneous space when more than 2 cm. More research is needed to assess the effect of body mass index and primary versus repeat caesarean.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The author's comment under 'Implications for research' that 'It is also important to explore the ability of the scar to withstand rupture in future pregnancies'. I am sure the review authors agree that skin suturing has no bearing on 'uterine scar rupture' in future pregnancies, and that 'rupture of skin scar' in subsequent pregnancies has never been reported. I hope this sentence is corrected in future updates.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-16 17:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the studies to include. One reviewer has an expertise in obstetrics, the other has a health services research background. Any articles where there was a dispute regarding inclusion were assessed by the third reviewer.</P>
<P>We assessed study quality using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (Clarke 2000). In addition to adequate allocation concealment, we also assessed blinding of outcome assessment and loss to follow up. We abstracted data onto 'hard copy' data sheets. We then entered data onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), which was checked by two reviewers independently for accuracy, and analysed using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for variables measured on a continuous scale indicating 95% confidence intervals. As there was only one study, we did not carry out a meta-analysis. However, if further trials are identified in the future, we will pool the results using a fixed effect model, which provides an average measure of treatment effect in the studies being analysed. In the presence of significant heterogeneity between studies the planned subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will provide valuable information to interpret findings.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in future work, we will conduct subgroup analyses to explore differences between elective and emergency caesarean sections as emergency sections may have a higher risk of endo-peritoneal infections and subsequent skin infection. We will also conduct subgroup analyses of vertical versus horizontal skin incisions and first caesarean section versus repeat caesarean section. We will explore the influence of trial quality on the findings of the review by conducting a sensitivity analysis of adequate allocation concealment versus unclear allocation concealment as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (Clarke 2000).</P>
<P>Outcome data that we have not prespecified, but have been reported by the authors, are discussed and are labelled 'not specified' in the analysis. The conclusions of the review are based on prespecified outcomes.</P>
