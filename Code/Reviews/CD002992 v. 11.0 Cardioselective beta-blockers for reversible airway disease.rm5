What does &amp;quot;Treatment Minus Placebo&amp;quot; mean in Comparison 1, please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: If there are any new studies this should be mentioned as the first line of the results, if not please say so.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect for those patients with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for single doses (-5.28% [CI, -10.03 to -0.54%]) or continued treatment (1.07% [CI, -3.3 to 5.44%]).&amp;quot; I cannot see this data in the MetaView graphs, the reader of the review cannot see the COPD results by themselves so this should be in another Comparison or Outcome.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In the continued treatment trials there was no significant difference in FEV1 response for beta1-blockers without ISA compared to those with ISA (5.94% [CI, -0.73 to 12.61%]). However, those without ISA produced a 12.6% increase in FEV1 (CI, 0.3 to 25.6%) after beta2-agonist administration compared to beta1-blockers with ISA.&amp;quot; How did you derive these between group differences and confidence intervals. The between group Chi-square test for the latter is NOT significant (Residual Chi score 2.54 with one df).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Studies are mostly cross-overs so how were these analysed? What data has been put in for the comparison 1 Outcome 1, (change from baseline?) Comparison 3,Outcome 3: Symptoms per patient week is not a dichotomous outcome as there is a problem with units of analysis; this needs to be changed to number of patients with symptoms or mean and SD of symptoms per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: I note that some of the SDs have changed since the original version. This needs properly documenting for me and for readers please. BEFORE i GO FURTHER WITH THIS PLEASE COULD YOU SEND A LIST OF WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE REVIEW (AND WHY IF POSS)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: IS THE GREATER RESPONSE TO BETA-AGONISTS DUE TO LOWER BASELINE FEV1 IN THE BETA-BLOCKER GROUP. IF SO THIS NEEDS VERY CAUTIOUS INTERPRETATION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent back to Toby for reviewers on 21/6/2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have outlined all the changes for this review in the What's New section, with the date of the original review. We never had a protocol published. I have also deleted all the extra references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help clarify, the main change in this revision was the different methods used for calculating the SDs for the net treatment effect in the cross-over trials that did not provide that information. This was done at the request of Steve Goodman, the statistician for the Annals of Internal Medicine, to better assess cross-over trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the Metaview labels where necessary, so that they are the right way and say Favours Beta-blocker and Favours Control. I have also clarified Treatment minus Placebo to include &amp;quot;% change from baseline&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Abstract we say there are no new studies in this updated version. We also include the two subgroups, with concomitant COPD and cardiovascular diseases, in the Metaview tables. The third subgroup analysis, comparing those with and without ISA, was calculated by our statistician, Ed Salpeter, and was not calculated in the Cochrane computer. I have now changed it to report each of the results separately, compared to placebo, so that all results can be clearly seen in Metaview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Methods section, we describe the different methods used to calculate the SDs for these cross-over trials, and state that this was changed from the previous version. We have also clarified in this section what data was used for the net treatment effect (% change from baseline for Treatment minus % change from baseline for Control). In addition, we changed the results for symptoms to be number of patients with symptoms, and changed the wording in the Methods, Results and in the Metaview table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the discussion, we clarify that for continued treatment with beta1-blockers without ISA, there is no decrease in FEV1 from baseline, while still maintaining a 12% increase in beta-agonist response compared to placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Feedback on the July Version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Shelley for doing all this tidying up. Paul, I still feel the sub-group testing is problematic (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISA results: &amp;quot;In the continued treatment trials there was no significant difference in FEV1 response for beta1-blockers without ISA compared to those with ISA (-3.22% [CI, -7.79 to 1.36%] compared to 2.72% [CI, -2.12 to 7.59%). However, those without ISA produced a 12.0% increase in FEV1 after beta2-agonist administration compared to placebo (CI, 4.12 to 19.87%) while beta1-blockers with ISA produced no change compared to placebo (-0.60% [CI, -13.93 to 12.73%]).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;The difference between these sub-groups can be assessed by subtracting the subgroup Chi-square totals (8.71) for the total Chi-square (11.25) and testing the difference against one degree of freedom (2.54); I do not think this reaches a P value of 0.05. To my mind this is therefore not a significant difference. In contrast the Chi residual between sub-groups is enormous in #1~1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passed to Toby for Paul 12/7/2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-09-30 16:52:16 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="CBB-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.3" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<P>Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary arterial disease. Traditionally they have not been given to patients with reversible airway disease (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a reversible obstructive component), for fear of adverse respiratory effects. This review of randomized controlled trials, which evaluated cardioselective beta-blocker use in patients with reversible airway disease, demonstrated no increase in adverse respiratory effects. From the available evidence, it appears to be safe to prescribe these drugs to people with reversible airways disease.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Beta-blocker therapy has mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with reversible airway disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:24:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed a search of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials up to June 2011. We checked reference lists of trial reports and review articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:24:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of the effects of single-dose or continued-treatment cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with reversible airway disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two independent review authors extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. We divided beta1-blockers into those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Interventions were: administration of single-dose or continued beta1-blocker, and response to beta2-agonist given after the study drug.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Nineteen studies on single-dose treatment and 10 studies on continued treatment met the inclusion criteria. Single-dose cardioselective beta-blocker produced a 7.46% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.59 to 9.32) reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but with a 4.63% (95% CI 2.47 to 6.78) increase in FEV1 with beta2-agonist, compared to placebo. Treatment lasting three to 28 days produced no change in FEV1 (mean difference (MD) -0.42% change from baseline; 95% CI -3.74 to 2.91), symptoms or inhaler use, whilst maintaining an 8.74% (95% CI 1.96 to 15.52) response to beta2-agonist. There was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect for those patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): single doses (MD -5.28%; 95% CI -10.03 to -0.54); continued treatment (MD 1.07%; 95% CI -3.30 to 5.44).</P>
<P>With continued treatment there was no significant difference in FEV1 response for beta1-blockers without ISA compared to those with ISA: -3.22% (95% CI -7.79 to 1.36) compared to 2.72% (95% CI -2.12 to 7.57). Those without ISA produced a 12.0% increase in FEV1 after beta2-agonist administration compared to placebo (95% CI 4.12 to 19.87) while beta1-blockers with ISA produced no change compared to placebo (MD -0.60%; 95% CI -13.93 to 12.73). These results were obtained in a small number of studies with few patients. The difference was not significant.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:24:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild to moderate reversible airway disease or COPD do not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients. Long-term safety still needs to be established.</P>

<P>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or beta-blockers, are indicated in the management of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia and thyrotoxicosis, as well as to reduce complications in the perioperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koch_x002d_Weser-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch-Weser 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IPPPSH-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPPPSH 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadworth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadworth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doughty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-VI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lechat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heidenreich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidenreich 1999</LINK>). Despite clear evidence of their effectiveness and mortality benefit, clinicians are often hesitant to administer them in the presence of a variety of common conditions for fear of adverse reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viskin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viskin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chafin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chafin 1999</LINK>). Review articles and practice guidelines have listed asthma as a contraindication to beta-blocker use, citing cases of acute bronchospasm occurring during non-cardioselective beta-blocker use (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belli 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-VI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1997</LINK>). Cardioselective beta-blockers, or beta1-blockers, have over 20 times more affinity for beta-1 receptors as for beta-2 receptors, and theoretically should have significantly less risk for bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Wellstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellstein 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>We evaluated only patients with documented reactive airway disease in this review, as these patients have been thought to be particularly susceptible to the respiratory effects of beta-blockers. Patients with COPD, in general, are at greater risk for ischemic heart disease than asthmatics, so may benefit more from the use of beta-blockers. This study evaluates a subgroup of patients with a documented chronic obstructive component, but was not designed to make recommendations about patients with COPD. Another recent Cochrane Review evaluated the use of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with COPD, given either as a single dose or for continued treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2011</LINK>). Pooled data from 22 trials demonstrated no adverse effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or respiratory symptoms for beta1-blockers compared to placebo, even for those with severe chronic airway obstruction.</P>

<P>We included randomized trials (RCTs) of cardioselective beta-blockers and included beta-blockers regardless of whether or not they were considered to possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolaescu-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaescu 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decalmer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Decalmer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lofdahl-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Lofdahl 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falliers-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Falliers 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAreavey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAreavey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadworth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadworth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lois-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lois 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lois-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lois 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We included studies of intravenous or oral beta1-blockers either as a single dose or for continued treatment.</P>
<P>We included single-dose trials if they:</P>
<OL>
<LI>reported forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) at baseline and follow-up or provided per cent variance;</LI>
<LI>withheld beta2-agonists for at least eight hours prior to initial FEV1 measurements;</LI>
<LI>did not include or exclude subjects for prior response, positive or negative, to beta-blockers;</LI>
<LI>were randomized and single or double-blinded;</LI>
<LI>placebo-controlled; and</LI>
<LI>included only subjects with documented reversible airway disease, demonstrated by a mean increase of at least 15% in FEV1 in response to beta2-agonist, response to methacholine challenge, or as asthma defined by the American Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1993</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We decided, a priori, that the above inclusion criteria (3) through (6) would be applied to trials of continued treatment. We included studies of continued treatment if they did not report FEV1, but instead evaluated the amount of beta2-agonist use and respiratory symptoms reported compared to placebo. In addition, we included trials even if beta2-agonists were not withheld during the trial.</P>
<P>We evaluated only cardioselective beta1-blockers in this study as these are the ones most frequently used in clinical practice. We included studies only if participants had clearly documented reversible airway disease. We chose FEV1 to evaluate respiratory function because it is a standardized and reproducible method of airway function. For single-dose trials, only studies that withheld beta2-agonists for at least eight hours prior to measurements were included, to maximize the response seen with beta2-blockers. We analyzed separately clinical trials that did not meet our inclusion criteria, but gave information on FEV1 responses to beta1-blockers in patients with reversible airway disease.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:25:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We estimated the net treatment effect by measuring the ratio of the lowest FEV1 value seen after study drug to baseline FEV1, for both placebo and active treatment, and recorded the per cent change from baseline. We then compared the treatment response to the placebo response. For studies of the response to beta2-agonists, we used the baseline of the FEV1 taken after study drug but prior to beta2-agonist or placebo. We calculated the net treatment effect by calculating the ratio of FEV1 measured after beta2-agonist to the new baseline for both placebo and active treatment, and then compared the treatment-agonist response to the placebo-agonist response.</P>
<P>We measured the results for respiratory symptoms as a risk difference, by subtracting the number of patients with respiratory symptoms after treatment from the number of patients with symptoms after placebo. We then pooled the risk differences using the fixed-effect model for dichotomous outcomes. For inhaler use during longer duration studies, we averaged the standard deviation (SD) for both placebo and treatment from the available data, and we calculated the weighted mean treatment effects using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcomes.</P>

<P>We have changed the methods used to obtain SD in the updated version of the review, to get a better assessment of the net treatment effect in these cross-over trials. Whenever possible, we calculated the SD for the net treatment effect from individual patient data or P values, and then used these figures to derive the SDs for the analysis. Some trials only provided SDs calculated for treatment response and placebo response separately. For those trials that did not report any information on SDs, we obtained the average SD from trials that provided such data and calculated these separately for placebo, treatment and beta2-agonist responses. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of including these trials, by using the lowest and highest available SD in place of the pooled SD, and also by excluding these trials from the analysis.</P>

The average baseline FEV1 for the treatment group was 1.81 (+/- 0.13) liters and for the placebo group was 1.81 (+/- 0.15) liters. Five of the studies (54 participants) did not provide data on FEV1 and were used for information on symptoms and inhaler use.</P>

However, those without ISA produced a 12% increase in FEV1 after beta2-agonist administration compared to placebo (95% CI 4.12 to 19.87%) while those with ISA produced no increase in FEV1 (MD -0.60%; 95% CI -13.93 to 12.73).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-20 14:27:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This meta-analysis pooled the data from 29 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the use of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with reversible airway disease. The results showed that, compared to placebo, the first dose of active treatment produced a small drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which was not associated with adverse respiratory effects. After continued treatment for a few days to weeks there was no difference in FEV1, symptoms or incidence of inhaler use. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given in a single dose or for continued treatment, were associated with an increase in response to beta2-agonists, as compared to placebo. No individual trial demonstrated an increase in respiratory symptoms compared to placebo. In fact, a review of all the 80 trials on cardioselective beta-blockers identified in the database search found no study that demonstrated an increase in respiratory symptoms for beta1-blockers compared to placebo or baseline.</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses to evaluate the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on patients with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, as these patients are most often targeted for beta-blocker treatment. There was no significant difference in the FEV1 treatment effect, number of patients with symptoms, or incidence of inhaler use in these patients.</P>
<P>This meta-analysis has several limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 1999</LINK>). Most of the participants were relatively young with mild to moderate airway obstruction, and those with recent asthma exacerbation were often excluded from study. In addition, many of the studies were of short duration, so it is not possible to comment on the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on the frequency or severity of acute asthma exacerbations after several months of treatment. Furthermore, this analysis was based only on published literature and therefore is subject to publication bias. However, funnel plots of effect size versus standard error for the trials in this analysis showed no evidence of bias. We believe that these pooled results provide valuable information on the safety of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with reversible airway disease, with or without concomitant COPD or cardiovascular disease.</P>
<P>In the past, the standard of care was to consider reversible airway disease to be a contraindication to the use of all beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belli 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-VI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1997</LINK>). Due to the proven mortality benefit of beta-blockers, many of the other relative or absolute contraindications traditionally listed for beta-blockers have been questioned and disproved, including impaired left ventricular function, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression and advanced age (<LINK REF="REF-Kjekshus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjekshus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wicklmayr-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wicklmayr 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beto-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beto 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bright-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bright 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lechat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumholz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumholz 1999</LINK>). Now, with the accumulated evidence of the safety of cardioselective beta-blockers in reversible airway disease, the most recent expert panel guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program state that these agents may be used in patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Expert-Panel-Report-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Expert Panel Report 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The original evidence of a potential adverse effect of beta-blockers in reversible airway disease was based on case reports of acute bronchospasm precipitated by high doses of non-cardioselective blockers, presumably due to their blockade of beta-2 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle (<LINK REF="REF-McNeill-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeill 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaid-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaid 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raine-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1981</LINK>). A search of the literature found 16 trials that met the inclusion criteria for this analysis but that evaluated non-cardioselective beta-blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sue-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sue 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-1983" TYPE="STUDY">George 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Light-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Light 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falliers-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Falliers 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lammers-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Lammers 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doshan-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Doshan 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giulekas-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Giulekas 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chodosh-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chodosh 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devereux-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devereux 1998</LINK>). Pooled results showed that regular use of nonselective beta-blockers, compared to placebo, caused a 13.5% reduction (95% confidence interval (CI) -23.0 to -4.0) in FEV1, and a 22.5% decrement (95% CI -32.5 to -12.5) in the FEV1 response after beta2-agonists were given. No significant increases in symptoms or inhaler use were found. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that the decrement in beta2-agonist response seen with nonselective beta-blockers may increase the risk of a clinically significant adverse effect occurring during an asthma exacerbation.</P>
<P>Cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol, bisoprolol and metoprolol are at least 20 times more potent at blocking beta-1 receptors than beta-2 receptors, so that at therapeutic doses the beta-2 blocking effect is negligible (<LINK REF="REF-Wellstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellstein 1987</LINK>). The doses of beta1-blockers evaluated in this analysis varied from therapeutic to supratherapeutic doses, those that are not generally used for initiation of treatment. For example, in single-dose studies using 50 to 200 mg of atenolol or metoprolol, no clinically apparent effect on respiratory function was demonstrated. Linear regression analysis could not differentiate a treatment effect between low and high doses, as there were so few low-dose trials.</P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis indicate that for cardioselective beta1-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), the minimal decrement in FEV1 noted on a single dose is attenuated over a few days to weeks. In addition, there is an increase in beta2-agonist response that is maintained with continued treatment. These results could be explained by an up-regulation or sensitization of beta-2 receptors, accompanied by an increased effect of endogenous or exogenous beta2-agonist stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motomura-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motomura 1990</LINK>). This paradoxical effect of upregulation on beta-2-agonist receptors may, in fact, be beneficial for patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Dickey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickey 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2011</LINK>). There has been recent interest in studying the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is now accumulating evidence that the use of inhaled beta2-agonists in patients with reactive airway disease is associated with a tolerance to beta2-agonist stimulation and a worsening of asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-Molinoff-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molinoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borst-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borst 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wahedna-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahedna 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2004</LINK>). Meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that the regular use of beta-agonists in asthma results in an increase in severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths, compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also evidence that treatment with beta-blockers that have intrinsic beta2 ISA is associated with down-regulation of beta2 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Busso-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busso 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sbirrazzuoli-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sbirrazzuoli 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodde-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodde 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakubetz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakubetz 1999</LINK>). This is consistent with data from this analysis that showed that continued treatment with beta1-blockers with ISA did not produce the increase in beta2-agonist response that was seen with beta1-blockers without ISA.</P>
<P>Only a small fraction of patients with heart disease who would benefit from beta-blockers are presently given this treatment, mainly due to unfounded fears of their adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sial-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sial 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soumerai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soumerai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumholz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumholz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1998</LINK>). A study by <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK> on survivors of myocardial infarction included 46,000 patients with asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease, and showed a significant reduction in total mortality for those treated with beta-blockers compared to those who were not. Other studies that have investigated the use of beta1-blockers in patients with cardiac disease and concomitant chronic obstructive lung disease or asthma found that these medicines were well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Quan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorow-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Dorow 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mooss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooss 1994</LINK>). Trials that evaluated the use of beta1-blockers in hypertensive patients, many of whom had reversible airway disease, did not demonstrate a worsening of respiratory symptoms or FEV1 in these patients (<LINK REF="STD-Formgren-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Formgren 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-1983" TYPE="STUDY">George 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krauss-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Krauss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falliers-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Falliers 1985</LINK>). A recent study by <LINK REF="REF-Heller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 2000</LINK> showed that COPD and asthma were the co-morbidities most commonly associated with beta-blockers being withheld in elderly patients after a myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>It is generally considered that patients with COPD are at greater risk than those with reversible airway disease for developing ischemic heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions requiring the use of beta-blockers. There is, however, significant overlap in the presenting features of COPD and reversible airway disease. Another recent meta-analysis evaluated the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with COPD and found no change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms for single doses or continued use of these agents compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2011</LINK>). Subgroup analyses revealed no difference in results for those with concomitant reversible airway disease, or with severe chronic airways obstruction as demonstrated by a baseline FEV1 of less than 1.4 liters or less than 50% normal predicted values. Three of the trials from that meta-analysis are also included in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>). The cumulative evidence from these two meta-analyses indicates that cardioselective beta-blockers should not be withheld in patients with reactive airway disease or COPD.</P>

<P>Beta-blocker treatment reduces mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. The available data suggest that there is a small reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following a single dose of a cardioselective beta-blocker, but the response to inhaled beta2-agonists is preserved, without any adverse respiratory effects. Continued treatment with relatively high doses of cardioselective beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) produces no reduction in FEV1, while increasing the sensitivity to beta2-agonist stimulation. It would be reasonable to start treatment with a low daily dose of a cardioselective beta-blocker without ISA and then titrate the dose up as needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-30 23:37:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the accumulated evidence we have now, it is apparent that patients with reversible airway disease should not be excluded from future beta1-blocker trials so that the treatment effect can be studied in this substantial population. It would also be helpful to conduct trials on the regulation of airway responsiveness in patients with reversible airway disease treated with cardioselective beta-blockers, to understand the effects of these medications on respiratory function. Due to the paradoxical effect of upregulation of beta-receptors, studies are now emerging to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of beta-blockers in the treatment of asthma. </P>
