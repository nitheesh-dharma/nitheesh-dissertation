<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-12 09:05:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>Loss of ankle flexibility is a common problem for people with neuromuscular disease. It can cause foot deformity, pain and problems walking. The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions for improving ankle flexibility in people with neuromuscular disease. Four studies were included in the review involving a total of 149 participants. Two studies showed that wearing a night splint was no more effective than not wearing a night splint for increasing ankle flexibility in 26 people who had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. One study showed corticosteroids (prednisone) did not significantly improve ankle flexibility in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the other study showed that while orthopaedic surgery initially increased ankle flexibility in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy this was not sustained in the long term. This review shows that, currently, there is limited evidence supporting any intervention for improving ankle flexibility in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Four studies involving 149 participants met inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies assessed the effect of night splinting in a total of 26 children and adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between wearing a night splint and not wearing a night splint. One study assessed the efficacy of prednisone treatment in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. While a daily dose of prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg/day resulted in significant improvements in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in ankle range of motion between groups. Increasing the prednisone dose to 1.5 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on ankle range of motion. One study evaluated early surgery in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Surgery resulted in increased ankle dorsiflexion range at 12 months but functional outcomes favoured the control group. By 24 months, many boys in the surgical group experienced a relapse of achilles tendon contractures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-10 22:55:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-12 09:05:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>Reduced ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, also known as ankle equinus, is a limitation of the ankle joint complex in the sagittal plane characterised by abnormal heel-to-toe loading during gait (<LINK REF="REF-Maurer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurer 1995</LINK>). It is frequently observed in individuals with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and may occur due to a number of active and passive neurophysiological mechanisms.</P>
<P>The incidence of ankle equinus appears to vary depending on the type of neuromuscular disorder. In conditions such as CMT and DMD, ankle equinus is predictable and commonly recognised as a major clinical concern. In a case series of 16 people with CMT types 1 and 2, 12 demonstrated a limitation of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion with 10 requiring intervention, such as physiotherapy or surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2007</LINK>). In DMD, significant limitation in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion can be expected to be seen in nearly all children older than 13 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1998</LINK>). Ankle equinus appears to be less frequently reported in the literature for neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>In individuals with neuromuscular disease, ankle equinus most frequently occurs as a result of acquired shortening of the posterior lower leg muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus). This shortening often results from ongoing postural compensations and positioning to maintain the body's centre of gravity due to characteristic patterns of muscle weakness and imbalance seen in many types of neuromuscular disorders such as DMD (<LINK REF="REF-Vignos-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eagle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 2002</LINK>) and CMT (<LINK REF="REF-Guyton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyton 2006</LINK>). Other causes of ankle equinus in individuals with neuromuscular disease include limb length discrepancy, prolonged tonic spasm due to pain, hypermobility, structural foot deformity, trauma and inflammatory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance of ankle equinus in neuromuscular disease</HEADING>
<P>Ankle equinus in individuals with neuromuscular disorders can lead to a number of secondary complications. These can be disabling and impact negatively on health related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Pfeiffer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeiffer 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acquired shortening of the posterior lower leg muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) causing ankle equinus results in an abnormal pattern of weight bearing through the foot when standing and walking (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1977a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1977a</LINK>). An inability to achieve at least a plantigrade position of the foot in weight bearing posture results in a concentration of pressure and stress beneath the forefoot (<LINK REF="REF-Macklin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklin 2007</LINK>). This abnormal pattern of weight bearing can lead to biomechanical compensations at the ankle joint complex (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1977b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1977b</LINK>) which over time, can lead to painful musculoskeletal conditions such as plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 1992</LINK>). These conditions can seriously compromise the comfort and functionality of standing and walking.</P>
<P>Inadequate ankle dorsiflexion range of motion can also cause difficulties with foot clearance during the swing phase of walking. This can compromise balance and safety during walking particularly in individuals with an underlying muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2006</LINK>). Trips and falls are commonly reported as being a significant concern in the daily lives of individuals with neuromuscular disorders as these events place limitations on their ability to function productively and safely within their home and community environments. Reduced confidence with ambulation can result in the reduction of activity levels which can have undesirable effects on bone mineral density, physical fitness and cardio-respiratory function (<LINK REF="REF-Vignos-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignos 1963</LINK>).</P>
<P>Premature loss of ambulation is another frequently reported secondary complication of ankle equinus in neuromuscular disease, most notably in the muscular dystrophies (<LINK REF="REF-Hyde-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyde 1982</LINK>). The specific pattern of muscle weakness seen in these disorders leads to postural adjustments in order to maintain the body's centre of gravity, such as toe walking. Over time these compensations can lead to ankle equinus and subsequent joint deformity, making upright mobility very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain.</P>
<P>Interestingly, some people with neuromuscular involvement may rely on passive plantarflexor stiffness for limb support and ambulation, and therapies which are designed to increase muscle length at the ankle joint may not be indicated for some people with neuromuscular disease (for example stroke) (<LINK REF="REF-Salasich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salasich 2000</LINK>). Nevertheless, ankle equinus is a clinical concern which warrants early intervention to prevent undesirable secondary complications. A systematic review of the literature will determine whether interventions to reduce ankle equinus are beneficial or detrimental for those with neuromuscular disorders.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 22:55:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In individuals with neuromuscular disorders, ankle equinus is a clinical problem that warrants early intervention in order to prevent the undesirable secondary complications of ankle deformity, reduced functional activity levels and premature loss of ambulation. Clinicians implement a number of interventions to reduce or resolve ankle equinus in individuals with neuromuscular disease. These include: stretching, for example passive manual stretching (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1981a</LINK>), night splinting (<LINK REF="REF-Refshauge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Refshauge 2006</LINK>), walking splints, orthoses and braces (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1977c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1977c</LINK>), serial casting (<LINK REF="STD-Main-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Main 2007</LINK>), active or passive joint range of motion exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Eagle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroksmark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroksmark 1999</LINK>); electrophysiological agents, for example heat or functional electrical stimulation (FES) (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1986</LINK>); manual therapies, for example soft tissue massage, passive accessory joint mobilisation and manipulation (<LINK REF="REF-Maitland-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maitland 1986</LINK>); surgery, for example tendon transfer procedures, osteotomies, triple arthrodesis, achilles tendon lengthening or release, etc (<LINK REF="REF-Manzur-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scher 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-12 09:05:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>Sustained stretching interventions such as serial casting and splinting are thought to increase extensibility of the posterior calf musculature and surrounding soft tissues through mechanical and neurophysiological mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2007</LINK>). Studies conducted in vitro demonstrate increases in both the length and number of sarcomeres when a muscle is immobilised in a lengthened position for a prolonged period of time (<LINK REF="REF-Cusick-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cusick 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, during sustained stretching of a muscle, tonic stretch reflexes that contribute to muscle stiffness are inhibited (<LINK REF="REF-Gajdosik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gajdosik 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical procedures such as lengthening of the achilles tendon are thought to result in a direct elongation of the tendon, whilst re-balancing procedures, such as a split tibialis posterior transfer, attempt to restore the balance of the musculature acting across the ankle joint (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1978</LINK>). Bony procedures such as osteotomies correct the bony anatomy that can be altered as a result of long term ankle equinus. These procedures are most frequently carried out in a step-wise manner and in combination rather than in isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Vignos-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignos 1983a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Electrophysiological agents such as heat and functional electrical stimulation (FES) may also assist to reduce ankle equinus. Heating modalities are frequently used clinically to complement stretching programs by warming the muscle and surrounding soft tissue of a joint enabling a more compliant stretch (<LINK REF="REF-Cosgray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosgray 2004</LINK>). FES is gaining popularity in the clinical setting to improve the maximum voluntary contraction of muscle groups using low frequency stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1986</LINK>). A larger contraction of the ankle dorsiflexors may increase ankle dorsiflexion range of motion by providing an active stretch of the ankle plantarflexors, particularly in individuals following stroke and in those with neuromuscular disorders who have muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Yan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Manual therapy and manipulation of the ankle joint is often provided by physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths or podiatrists to attempt to increase joint range of motion by providing small movements within the ankle joint complex which individuals may not be able to provide for themselves with everyday activity (<LINK REF="REF-Maitland-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maitland 1986</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 10:55:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>Clinicians such as physiotherapists, podiatrists, rehabilitation specialists and orthopaedic surgeons devote considerable time, energy and resources implementing interventions to reduce or resolve ankle equinus. Unfortunately few of these interventions have been subjected to rigorous investigation and as such their effect has not been well determined. As a consequence, much of our clinical practice is guided by expert clinical opinion. A systematic review of interventions for ankle equinus in neuromuscular disease will assist in providing information regarding the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or resolve ankle equinus and will allow for ongoing evaluation of these interventions in the literature.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-12-10 23:37:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two review authors (KR and JB) rated the risk of bias (or methodological quality) of the trials independently using the standardised grading system described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This grading system considered for each trial:</P>
<P>(1) adequate sequence generation;</P>
<P>(2) allocation concealment;</P>
<P>(3) blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (assessed for each outcome);</P>
<P>(4) incomplete outcome data;</P>
<P>(5) selective outcome reporting;</P>

<P>Each criterion was assigned a classification of 'yes', 'no' or 'unclear'  as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. A 'yes' classification indicated a low risk of bias, 'no' indicated a high risk of bias and 'unclear' indicated there was insufficient information to permit a 'yes' or 'no' judgement.</P>

<P>Where feasible, we combined the results of trials with the same treatment or management approach in a meta-analysis.

For studies measuring the same construct at varying time intervals we used data measured at the same time points. Where the same outcome measure was used, weighted mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for continuous variables. When different outcome measures were used to quantify the same construct, standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CIs were calculated. Results for dichotomous data were reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs using a fixed-effect model.</P>

<B>Included studies</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors selected a total of 14 full-length possibly relevant articles and one unpublished thesis for evaluation. Four of the potentially relevant studies were randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials of interventions for increasing ankle range of motion in people with neuromuscular disease and fulfilled all inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). The characteristics of these studies are summarised in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Electronic searching identified three of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). Discussion with expert researchers in the field identified one unpublished study presented as a chapter in a PhD thesis (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>). Of the four included trials, one was a cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>)<B> </B>and<B> </B>three were parallel-designed randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
</P>
<P>The four studies included a total of 149 participants with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Two studies included a total of 26 individuals with CMT1A (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). One of these studies included 12 individuals with CMT1A aged 7 to 57 years (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>) and the other (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>) included 14 individuals with CMT1A aged 7 to 30 years. The other two studies included a total of 123 boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). One of these studies included 20 boys with DMD aged 4 to 6 years (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>) and the other study included 103 boys with DMD aged 5 to 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>Two studies evaluated the effect of night splinting in individuals with CMT1A. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>)<B> </B>investigated the effect of 12 weeks of night splinting using a commercially available thermoplastic below knee splint (OTS Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia). Participants acted as their own controls, wearing the splint on one leg only (randomly selected) every night for the duration of the study (12 weeks). The splint was hinged at the ankle so it could be adjusted, although the angle at which the ankle was splinted during the study was not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK> also<B> </B>investigated the effect of 12 weeks of night splinting in individuals with CMT1A. A commercially available below knee splint with a hinge at the ankle was also used in this study (brand of splint not reported). Using a cross-over design, participants acted as their own controls, wearing the splint on one leg only (randomly selected) every night for six weeks, then on the opposite leg for the following six weeks. Participants spent the final 12 weeks not wearing splints on either leg. Initially the splint was adjusted into ankle dorsiflexion until the participants felt a stretch sensation in their calf muscle which they felt could be tolerated while sleeping. The participants were encouraged to adjust the splint themselves if they felt they were not getting a sufficient stretch at home, otherwise the treating physiotherapist would adjust it, as appropriate, at each study visit.</P>
<P>Two studies investigated the effect of interventions for increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in boys with DMD. One study compared two different daily doses of prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day and 1.5 mg/kg/day) with placebo tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).The other study investigated the effectiveness of orthopaedic surgery in young, ambulant boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>). Ten boys had orthopaedic surgery using the Rideau procedure which involved surgical release of hip flexors and iliotibial bands as well as achilles tendon lengthening. Ten boys had 'routine management' consisting of passive stretching of the achilles tendon, iliotibial band and hip flexors. Where possible boys were followed up for up to two years following randomisation.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>In the two studies evaluating night splinting in CMT1A, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was measured using the Lidcombe Template (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 1991</LINK>). In the two studies evaluating interventions for boys with DMD, standard goniometry was used to measure ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>), although the method used to report ankle dorsiflexion range varied between these studies. In one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>) ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was included as a component of a contracture index which also incorporated joint range of motion measures for the shoulders, elbows and the knees (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). An average contracture score was calculated consisting of the sum of the contracture measures expressed as a percentage of a theoretical maximum possible contracture for each joint assessed (100 degrees for the ankles, 50 degrees for the iliotibial band and 135 degrees for the shoulders, elbows, hips and knees). In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>) ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was reported as a loss of movement through what was considered to be normal ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (20 degrees).</P>
<P>Three studies assessed muscle strength. Two studies used hand-held dynamometers to assess muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). One study measured isometric foot and ankle muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>) and the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>) measured the isometric strength of six lower limb muscle groups. Two studies measured muscle strength of 34 upper and lower limb muscle groups by manual muscle testing using Medical Research Council (MRC) grades (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Functional motor ability was assessed in the two studies including boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>) used a combination of functional grades and timed tests to assess motor function. Lower limb function was assessed by allocating a functional grade according to the Brooke Scale. Timed function tests of motor function were also included such as time to progress nine metres, rise from the floor (Gower&#8217;s time) and climb a set of four standard stairs. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>) assessed functional motor ability using timed tests including time to rise from the floor as well as time to walk distances of 28 and 50 feet.</P>
<P>Compliance with the treatment intervention was assessed in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). Two studies investigating the effect of night splinting for individuals with CMT1A supplied participants with a study diary where they recorded the number of hours the splint was worn each night. In the study investigating the effect of prednisone in boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>) compliance with taking medication was examined by weighing the medication bottles returned at each study visit.</P>
<P>Adverse outcomes of night splinting, prednisone and surgery were recorded.</P>

<B>Excluded studies</B>
</P>
<P>After reading the full text versions of the 14 potentially relevant studies, a total of 11 studies were excluded (see Table 2: Characteristics of excluded studies). Seven of the potentially relevant trials, published in detail in peer reviewed journals, were excluded because they were not randomised or controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Forst-J-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Forst J 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst--R-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forst R 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Main-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Main 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seeger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Seeger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). Three studies were excluded as they did not include ankle dorsiflexion range of motion as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1981b</LINK>). For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 2000</LINK>) raw data were not available for statistical analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK>)<B> </B>was excluded as it was an extension of one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>), and while randomisation and blinding were maintained from one study to the other there was no wash-out period in the transition between studies. In addition only historical controls from the placebo group in the <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> study were used to compare outcomes in the treatment groups. As a result there was no contemporary placebo group acting as a control which would have been desirable given the rapidly progressive nature of DMD (<LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1983</LINK>).</P>

In each age stratum, five sets of four digit codes were generated using computer software which identified the limb to be studied. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>), the treating physiotherapist randomised the first limb to be splinted by coin toss<B>.</B> Details of how allocation sequence was generated were not reported in the remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequate in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>) (opaque envelopes by the departmental administrator). In two studies it was unclear what steps were taken to implement concealed random allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). In one of the studies allocation concealment was not adequate as it did not occur centrally or via the use of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). Allocation of the first limb to be splinted was via coin toss by the treating physiotherapist, who did not enrol study participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In one double-blinded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>), all study personnel, care givers and participants were blinded to the intervention group. In studies involving therapy and surgery, blinding participants and therapists to study interventions can be difficult, if not impossible to achieve. However it is often possible to ensure the outcome assessor is adequately blinded to the study intervention. In three of the included studies it was not possible to blind participants and their caregivers due to the physical nature of the interventions studied (night splinting and orthopaedic surgery) (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). In two of these studies the outcome assessors were blinded to the study limb (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>) or the order of the limb treated (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>, no blinding occurred as boys allocated to the orthopaedic surgery group would have been easily distinguishable from those who were in the group receiving conservative management.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>All studies adequately disclosed withdrawals and drop outs. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted in two studies to statistically account for participant drop outs and withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>). One study used per-protocol analysis where participants were included in the final data analysis only if they received the intended intervention in accordance with the study protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). In one study, some participants were unable to complete some of the function tests due to progression of their DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). The methods used to account for this missing data were not discussed.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>)<B> </B>also reported feedback received from study participants. The night splints were generally well liked by the study participants especially by those who had worn them previously. Participants in both studies also liked being able to self adjust the splints. The negative aspects of wearing the night splints were also reported by participants in both studies. Many participants noted the splints interfered with their sleep as they were uncomfortable and caused excessive perspiration, which necessitated removal mid-way through the night (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). Some participants also mentioned it was difficult to find the right strap tension on the splint, making it difficult to maintain their heel fully in the splint and as a consequence their foot would fall out of the splint during the night (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compliance with treatment was quantified using a diary in both studies. While it was not specified as an outcome measure for this review it can often be regarded as a surrogate measure of satisfaction. In the <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK> study, the night splint was worn for an average five nights per week with only one participant wearing the splint every night for the duration of the trial. In the <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK> study, participants wore the splints for an average of seven hours each night (SD 2, range 4 to 9) for an average of 37 of a possible 42 nights (SD 8, range 18 to 42) representing an 88% rate of compliance.</P>

In one of the studies a participant withdrew after three weeks due to generalised discomfort when wearing the splint (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). In the other study one participant drop-out was reported due to discomfort in the hip on the same side as the leg being splinted.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-21 18:35:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>Two studies evaluated the short term effect of night splinting on ankle range of motion in 26 participants with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and were combined for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). There was no significant effect of 12 weeks of night splinting in individuals with CMT1A on ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. Subgroup analysis by age group (younger than 18 years and 18 years or older) did not indicate younger participants responded better to night splinting in terms of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion than older study participants. While one of the trials was adequately powered (n = 14) (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>), the other was stopped early and was under-powered to detect a clinically worthwhile treatment effect (n = 12) (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>). In both studies the outcome assessors were blind to the study limb (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>) or the order of the treated limb (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). While double-blinding of study participants or care-givers would have been preferable, it was not possible in these studies due to the physical nature of the intervention. The lack of treatment effect may relate to reported problems with the pre-fabricated night splint used in the study. Difficulties such as the foot slipping out of the splint during the night and concerns regarding the intensity of the stretch were reported in both studies. Future trials evaluating splinting devices, for example custom made removable night casts should be considered. While no other studies of night splinting have been performed in CMT1A, two studies of night splinting in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) reported a delay in the development of ankle contracture with night splints (<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1981a</LINK>). Although the muscle composition of boys with DMD differs from that of patients with CMT1A, and would likely respond to stretch differently, these results are promising and warrant further inquiry.</P>
<P>One study investigated the effect of orthopaedic surgery on ankle range of motion in young, ambulant boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>). The Rideau surgical technique increased ankle range after one year, but this effect was not maintained at two years follow-up. There was no blinding of study participants or the outcome assessor. Boys who had surgery would have been easily identifiable from those who were in the group receiving conservative therapy. Other non-randomised studies have reported significant release of the Achilles tendon can be obtained with the Rideau surgical technique (<LINK REF="STD-Forst-J-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Forst J 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst--R-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forst R 1995</LINK>). Although some regression in ankle dorsiflexion range was seen at four year follow-up, this range was markedly greater than natural history controls.</P>
<P>One trial included measures of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in a trial evaluating the effect of prednisone in boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). No significant difference in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was seen between boys with DMD treated with daily prednisone for six months (0.75 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day) and placebo treated controls. The overall methodological quality of the study was high. No other randomised controlled trials of prednisone treatment in boys with DMD have included ankle dorsiflexion range of motion as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>A variety of methods for measuring ankle dorsiflexion range of motion were reported in the included studies. In two studies, the Lidcombe Template was used to measure ankle dorsiflexion range (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>), a technique with excellent reliability in healthy individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.97) (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 1991</LINK>) but only moderate reliability in individuals with CMT1A (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>) (ICC = 0.62) and a large measurement error of 3.4 degrees (limits of agreement -3.3 to 10 degrees). Given the minimal clinically important difference was considered to be 5 degrees in both night splinting studies in CMT1A, the magnitude of measurement error of the Lidcombe Template is a concern.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Functional improvement</HEADING>
<P>Two studies evaluated the effect of an intervention on functional motor ability (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). In one study improvements in measures of functional motor ability were reported in boys with DMD treated with prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). There is a large body of literature, including a systematic review, reporting similar improvements in strength and function in response to corticosteroid treatment in DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fenichel-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenichel 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griggs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manzur-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzur 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surprisingly, in the other study assessing motor function following orthopaedic surgery in boys with DMD, functional outcomes generally favoured boys who did not have surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>). The results of larger, more recent studies of the Rideau procedure in slightly older, ambulant boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Forst-J-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Forst J 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst--R-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forst R 1995</LINK>) contrast with these findings. In two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Forst-J-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Forst J 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Forst--R-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forst R 1995</LINK>, boys who had the Rideau procedure were seen to ambulate on average 1.25 years longer than boys who did not have the procedure.</P>
<P>In one of the night casting studies, anecdotally, participants felt better able to function in their daily lives and less likely to sprain the ankle on the leg the splint was being worn (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). These personal experiences warrant further inquiry. In a recent study of factors influencing foot weakness in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, reduced ankle flexibility was associated with weakness of inversion (r = 0.231, P<I> </I>= 0.042), eversion (r = 0.377, P = 0.001), dorsiflexion (r<I> = </I>0.404, P <I>= </I>0.001), plantarflexion (r <I>= </I>0.275, P <I>= </I>0.015), and global foot strength (r <I>= </I>0.353, P <I>= </I>0.002), independent of age and physical body size (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2009a</LINK>). Since there is emerging evidence that restricted ankle dorsiflexion range of motion is a strong predictor of recurrent ankle sprain (<LINK REF="REF-de-Noronha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Noronha 2006</LINK>), and impaired motor function and recurrent ankle sprains are substantial problems for people with CMT1A (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redmond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redmond 2008</LINK>) it would be worthwhile to include measures of motor function in future studies of interventions for increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Foot alignment</HEADING>
<P>One trial evaluated the effect of night splinting on foot alignment in 12 participants with CMT1A. No statistically significant difference was seen between wearing the night splint and not wearing the night splint on foot alignment, assessed using the Foot Posture Index. The Foot Posture Index is a reliable and valid tool for measuring foot alignment in CMT1A (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>). As foot deformity is a disabling problem for people with CMT1A, it would be of interest to determine whether the progression of foot deformity in neuromuscular disease can be prevented, slowed or reversed with this type of intervention in larger studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Foot and ankle muscle strength</HEADING>
<P>Only one study investigated the effect of an intervention in increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion on foot and ankle muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). No significant differences with night casting were found. In future studies, it would be worthwhile to continue evaluating the effect of stretching interventions on isometric muscle strength using reliable techniques. Concerns exist amongst some health professionals that lengthening weak muscle could cause further weakness and dysfunction by placing it at a mechanical disadvantage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health-related quality of life</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies investigated the effect of increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion on health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life is a meaningful and important outcome in clinical trials for people with neuromuscular disease. Recent studies have shown neuromuscular disorders such as CMT and DMD can have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Grootenhuis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grootenhuis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kohler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redmond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redmond 2008</LINK>). Considering many regulatory bodies now require the inclusion of outcomes with relevance and meaning to the study participants, it would be desirable in the future to assess the impact of interventions for increasing ankle range of motion in individuals with neuromuscular disease on their health-related quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient satisfaction with the intervention </HEADING>
<P>Participant satisfaction was not assessed in any of the studies included in this review. It is a measure which should be considered in future clinical trials as an important outcome measure to assist cost-benefit analysis and to continue to review and refine therapeutic approaches.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>All trials included in this review reported adverse events. One adverse event was reported in each of the night splinting studies (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>). These were minor and included generalised discomfort when wearing the splint (<LINK REF="STD-Refshauge-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Refshauge 2007</LINK>) as well as hip pain on the side of the splinted limb, which was present before the study started (<LINK REF="STD-Redmond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 2004</LINK>). One adverse event was reported in the study investigating orthopaedic surgery for boys with DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Manzur-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Manzur 1992</LINK>). This event was also minor and involved swelling and tenderness around the site of the Achilles tenotomy. Prednisone treatment in boys with DMD produced a high number of adverse events compared with placebo, particularly boys on the highest prednisone dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). It is widely understood that long term prednisone therapy is associated with an increased risk of fracture, behavioural and gastrointestinal upset as well as acne and cushingoid appearance (<LINK REF="REF-Manzur-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzur 2008</LINK>). However, corticosteroids constitute the current gold standard therapy for DMD (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK>). The benefits that corticosteroids offer in terms of slowing disease progression are, in many cases, considered to outweigh the risk of these events, many of which can be prevented or managed with good standards of clinical care (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost-benefit analysis</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies conducted a formal cost benefit analysis for any of the intervention. In the future a cost-benefit analysis of interventions for increasing ankle range of motion in people with neuromuscular disorders should be considered.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>This review provides a comprehensive appraisal and assessment of the literature regarding interventions for increasing ankle range of motion for individuals with neuromuscular disease. Given the prevalence of neuromuscular disorders worldwide of approximately 1 in 3500 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1991</LINK>), it was surprising that only four studies in two disorders (DMD and CMT1A) involving 149 participants were identified. Although clinicians use a variety of interventions for improving ankle flexibility in people with neuromuscular disorders, it was noteworthy that only three interventions were identified (Rideau surgery, night casting and prednisone). Since the pathological processes involved in muscle and nerve disorders differ and muscle composition varies (<LINK REF="REF-Gallardo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallardo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercuri 2007</LINK>), this review should only be generalised to the specific neuromuscular disorders and interventions reported.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-10-20 10:24:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>This review indicates that there is no evidence of significant benefit from any intervention for increasing ankle range of motion in people with CMT1A and DMD. However, the overall quality of this evidence was very low and further research is required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-19 14:00:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kristy J Rose">
<P>Reduced ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, or ankle equinus, is a highly prevalent and significant problem for people living with neuromuscular disease. There is an urgent need to evaluate interventions for increasing ankle range of motion in this population, particularly since a number of non-randomised, yet well conducted studies suggest similar interventions to those in this review could be effective in other patient groups. Randomised trials that are sufficiently powered and use reliable and valid outcome measures are required to assess the effect of interventions for increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in individuals with a wider variety of neuromuscular disorders. Assessing the impact of these interventions over a longer length of time using outcomes of relevance and importance to these individuals also needs to be considered.</P>
