<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-12-07 12:16:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening type of stroke caused when a small blood vessel near the surface of the brain bursts. The bleeding usually comes from an aneurysm (a weakness in the blood vessel wall). The blood enters the fluid-filled space around the brain called the subarachnoid space, which lies between the outer surface of the brain and the inner surface of the skull. Thus, the condition is called aneurysmal SAH. Approximately one-third of patients develop a complication of the bleeding in which narrowing of the blood vessels occurs. In turn, this may cause the blood supply to parts of the brain to be reduced or stopped. The resulting brain damage is called delayed cerebral ischaemia. It happens most often four to 10 days after SAH, and it can cause disability or even death. In animal studies, the drug tirilazad appeared to reduce brain damage after SAH. We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials of tirilazad in patients with SAH to see if it could reduce the risk of death or disability. The review did not show any evidence of benefit from tirilazad in patients with aneurysmal SAH.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-12-07 12:09:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched October 2009); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 2, 2009); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2009); EMBASE (1980 to October 2009); and the Stroke Trials Directory, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database (searched October 2009). We handsearched 10 Chinese journals, searched the reference lists of relevant publications, and contacted the manufacturers of tirilazad.<BR/>

<P>Randomised trials of tirilazad started within four days of SAH onset, compared with placebo or open control in patients with aneurysmal SAH documented by angiography and computerised tomography (CT) scan or cerebrospinal fluid examination, or both.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-12-21 12:50:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 3821 patients; there was no significant heterogeneity. Oral or intravenous nimodipine was used routinely as a background treatment in both groups in all trials. There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of follow up for the primary outcome, death (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06), or in poor outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21). During the treatment period, fewer patients developed delayed cerebral ischaemia in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant difference in effects of tirilazad on clinical outcomes. Leukocytosis and prolongation of Q-T interval occurred significantly more frequently in the treatment group in only one trial evaluating tirilazad at high dose. There was no significant difference in infusion site disorders or other laboratory parameters between the two groups.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-07 12:04:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-12-21 12:53:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-12-21 12:51:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in contemporary society. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) accounts for approximately 6% to 8% of all strokes and 22% to 25% of cerebrovascular deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 1997</LINK>). In a meta-analysis of relevant studies, the pooled incidence rate was about nine per 100,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-de-Rooij-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Rooij 2007</LINK>). Despite improvement in the medical and surgical management of patients with aneurysmal SAH (the wider use of calcium antagonists, the move from surgical to endovascular treatment of ruptured aneurysms, and improvements in general medical care) morbidity and mortality remain high. Twenty-five per cent of patients allocated endovascular treatment died or were dependent at two months (<LINK REF="REF-ISAT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISAT 2002</LINK>). Delayed cerebral ischaemia, a major complication of SAH, has been demonstrated to be a significant predictor of adverse outcome and an important cause of death and disability in patients with aneurysmal SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Kassell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosengart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosengart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solenski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solenski 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Delayed cerebral ischaemia occurs with a peak four to 10 days after SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Deitrich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deitrich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grasso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grasso 2002</LINK>). Compared with recently identified causes, including microcirculatory dysfunction, thromboembolism and cortical spreading depression, cerebral vasospasm has been considered as the classic and most important cause of delayed cerebral ischaemia after SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 2007</LINK>). Angiographic vasospasm develops in 50% to 70% of patients with SAH, and half of them experience delayed cerebral ischaemia (symptomatic vasospasm) (<LINK REF="REF-Dorsch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keyrouz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keyrouz 2007</LINK>). The presence of cerebral vasospasm has been correlated with a one-and-a-half to three-fold increase in mortality in the first two weeks after SAH.</P>
<P>Free-radical-induced lipid peroxidation has been identified as a potentially important contributor to both the arterial narrowing of vasospasm and the final cascade of ischaemic cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treggiari_x002d_Venzi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treggiari-Venzi 2001</LINK>). Tirilazad mesylate is a non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, which has been developed for the acute treatment of SAH, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), and ischaemic stroke. The substance has an anti-lipid peroxidation action through different mechanisms working in co-operation, including radical scavenging action (that is, a chemical antioxidant effect) and physicochemical interaction with the cell membrane leading to membrane fluidity decrease (that is, membrane stabilisation) (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1988b</LINK>). Tirilazad mesylate has a neuroprotective action in experimental models of TBI, SCI, and acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meden 1996</LINK>). While human studies have not shown tirilazad to be effective in TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>) nor in acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-TISC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">TISC 2001</LINK>), it reduced mortality or increased frequency of good recovery measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in some subgroups of patients with SAH in three of four phase III studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>). Indeed, in experimental models of SAH and focal cerebral ischaemia, tirilazad has been shown to improve cerebral vasospasm and cerebral blood flow, as well as reduce the size of cerebral infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Kanamaru-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanamaru 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanamaru-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanamaru 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsui-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsui 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinke-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinke 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vollmer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollmer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zuccarello-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuccarello 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, preliminary studies with this drug have shown it to be safe and not associated with side effects such as hypotension, mental status changes or glucocorticoid toxicities (<LINK REF="REF-Fleishaker-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleishaker 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleishaker-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleishaker 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleishaker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleishaker 1997</LINK>). Local infusion-related irritation and thrombophlebitis were the main adverse events, partially explained by the presence of citrate in the placebo solution (<LINK REF="REF-Fleishaker-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleishaker 1993b</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of phase II and phase III trials have been undertaken in patients with aneurysmal SAH; this systematic review assesses these trials in the context of safety and efficacy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>To determine the studies to be assessed further, we scanned the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved. We rejected articles on initial screening if we could determine from the title and abstract that the article was not a report of a randomised controlled trial or that the trial did not address the effect of intravenous tirilazad mesylate on the mortality and morbidity of SAH. If there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, we retrieved the full article for clarification. We developed an inclusion/exclusion form to assist with the selection of trials. Two review authors (SHZ, LCW) independently assessed the selection of studies, and resolved any disagreements by discussion, when necessary in consultation with a third review author (ML). If it was not possible to resolve a disagreement, we added the study to those awaiting assessment and we contacted the study authors for clarification.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (SHZ, LCW) independently extracted and cross-checked data on patients, methods, interventions, outcomes and results. The following key information was extracted.</P>
<OL>
<LI>General information: published/unpublished, title, authors, reference/source, contact address, country, urban/rural, language of publication, year of publication, duplicate publications, sponsor, setting.</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics: design, duration of follow up, method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (patients, people administering treatment, outcome assessors).</LI>
<LI>Intervention(s): intervention(s) (dose, route, timing), comparison intervention(s) (dose, route, timing), co-medication(s) (dose, route, timing).</LI>
<LI>Patients: exclusion criteria, total number and number in comparison groups, age (adults), baseline characteristics, diagnostic criteria, similarity of groups at baseline (including any co-morbidity), assessment of compliance, withdrawals/losses to follow up (reasons/description), subgroups.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: outcomes specified above, any other outcomes assessed, other events, length of follow up, quality of reporting of outcomes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The two review authors resolved any inconsistencies in the extracted data by discussion; if consensus could not be reached, the two review authors consulted a third review author (ML) and her decision was final. If there were patients excluded or lost to follow up after randomisation (trials with so-called explanatory analysis) or if any of the above data were not available from the publication, we sought further information by contacting the trialist. If the data remained unavailable, we decided by consensus whether to include the trial in the review or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of reporting of each trial based largely on the following factors as advised by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Minimisation of selection bias: (a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? (b) was the allocation concealment adequate?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of performance bias: were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of attrition bias: (a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? (b) was analysis by intention-to-treat?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of detection bias: were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</LI>
</OL>
<P>Based on these criteria, we broadly subdivided studies into the following three categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analyses</HEADING>
<P>We used the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic to test for heterogeneity between trials results. We reported the results as Peto odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data using the Peto fixed-effect method (<LINK REF="REF-APT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT 1994</LINK>). We examined publication bias and other biases using a funnel plot. We plotted effect size against each study's sample size, resulting in a graphical display which gave some indication of whether or not some studies with particular study and effect size combinations had not been published or located.</P>

<P>We hypothesised that different doses (e.g. 0.6 mg/kg/d, 2 mg/kg/d, 6 mg/kg/d, 15 mg/kg/d) and gender (male and female) might have varying effects on the prognosis of SAH, as suggested by subgroup analysis in some previous trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>).

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-12-21 11:07:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We identified a total of 245 relevant references from the electronic searches and handsearches. Five randomised placebo-controlled trials, including a total of 3821 patients with SAH due to saccular aneurysm confirmed by angiography or surgery, met our inclusion criteria. We did not exclude any trials. We contacted the authors of the five included trials and the company that manufactured and provided tirilazad for the included trials by email to request missing data and details of other unpublished trials; however, only two study authors responded and stated that the trial data were no longer available to them.</P>
<P>The five included trials were multicentre trials, of which one was conducted in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>), two in North America (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>), and two trials in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>). All trials included patients more than 18 years old. Two trials included female patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>). Four trials included patients with any neurological deficit score, whereas one trial included patients with a World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade less than 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tirilazad was administered intravenously from day three to day 10 after SAH onset in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>), from day two to day 10 in the other four trials. Two trials evaluated the efficacy of tirilazad at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>), two trials evaluated tirilazad at a dose of 0.6, 2 and 6 mg/kg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>), and one trial evaluated tirilazad at dose of 2 and 6 mg/kg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>). In addition to tirilazad or placebo, oral or intravenous nimodipine was prescribed for all patients in all five trials; 3H treatment (hypertension, hypervolaemia and haemodilution) and surgery were also allowed if necessary.</P>
<P>All the included trials followed up patients for three months and used similar primary outcome measures including symptomatic vasospasm within two weeks, mortality and overall favourable outcome defined as either good recovery or moderate disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale score ranging from 1 to 2) at the end of three months. Cerebral infarction documented by CT scan, proportion of 3H therapy used for treating symptomatic vasospasm, and incidence of death or permanent disability due to vasospasm were also analysed in most trials. The adverse events related to tirilazad or placebo were recorded in all trials but presented in detail in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-12-21 12:51:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All the included trials were double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Although randomisation methods were not reported in the published articles, baseline characteristics of patients were comparable among groups in all trials except there were more female patients in the placebo group in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>). Losses to follow up were reported in four trials, the rate ranged from 0.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>) to 1.2% (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was stated in all trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>). However, patients who did not receive trial drugs after randomisation were not included in the analysis in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>), although the numbers were small (0.8%, 0.8%, 0.3%, and 1.1%; respectively).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-12-21 12:52:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In the overall analysis, we merged patients treated with different doses of tirilazad in each trial into one group. Since data for 26 patients who did not receive the trial drugs after randomisation were not available, we based the following analyses on data for the remaining 3795 patients.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death from any cause at the end of follow up</HEADING>
<P>All included trials reported the number of patients who were dead at the end of follow up (three months). A total of 28 patients (0.7%) were lost to follow up. We found no substantial heterogeneity among these trials. There was a non-significant tendency of fewer deaths in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the best-case-scenario analysis, in which all patients lost to follow up in the tirilazad group were treated as being alive whereas patients lost to follow up in the control group were treated as being dead, the result is not significantly changed (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.71 to 1.02).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Poor outcome at the end of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for all included trials. Poor outcome was defined as death or severe disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale score &gt; 2) in all trials. A total of 28 patients (0.7%) were lost to follow up. We found no substantial heterogeneity among the trials. There was no significant difference in poor outcome between the tirilazad group and the control group at three months (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In the best-case-scenario analysis described above, there is no significant change in the result (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.17).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptomatic vasospasm within two weeks</HEADING>
<P>The number of patients with symptomatic vasospasm was recorded in the five included trials. The diagnostic criteria of symptomatic vasospasm in the trials were consistent with the definition of delayed cerebral ischaemia in this review. Data for three patients (1.2%) were lost in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>). We found no substantial heterogeneity among the trials. Overall, there were fewer patients with symptomatic vasospasm in the tirilazad group than in the control group (28.1% versus 33.9%), the difference is statistically significant (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The funnel plot did not indicate the presence of publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CT/MRI-documented cerebral infarction</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials followed all patients by CT/MRI scan at the end of follow up. One trial reported the number of patients with cerebral infarction, which was regarded as a serious medical event (<LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>). One trial presented data of all cerebral infarctions within two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>). Two trials only reported the number of patients with cerebral infarction due to symptomatic vasospasm within two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>). No significant difference between the tirilazad group and the control group was reported in each trial. We did not perform meta-analysis because of the previously reported heterogeneity. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events related to tirilazad</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events related to tirilazad and the control were observed in all included trials, but detailed data were reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>). Infusion site disorders including pain, inflammation, tenderness and phlebitis were commonly reported, the incidences ranged from 3.5% to 37% for tirilazad and 1.2% to 37% for placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>). A total of 13 patients (1.2%, five for tirilazad and eight for placebo) withdrew from the trial due to infusion site disorders in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>). The other reported adverse events included elevated levels of liver enzymes and creatine kinase, abnormal electrocardiogram, and leukocytosis. There was no significant difference in these adverse events between the tirilazad group and the placebo group in all trials, except there were significantly more patients with prolongation of Q-T interval in electrocardiogram and patients with leukocytosis in the tirilazad (15 mg/kg) group in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>).</P>

In both subgroups (males and females), there were no significant differences in death or overall poor outcome between the tirilazad group and the control group. No significant subgroup differences were found for death (P = 0.14, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 53.2%) or overall poor outcome (P = 0.70, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%)</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparing the efficacy of various doses of tirilazad</HEADING>
<P>Four doses of tirilazad (0.6, 2, 6, and 15 mg/kg) were evaluated in the five included trials. There was no significant subgroup difference on any outcome among the four doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparing the efficacy of tirilazad therapy by neurological severity</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of tirilazad on clinical outcome and secondary vasospasm</HEADING>
<P>Our aggregation of five trials with a total of 3821 patients suggests that tirilazad may reduce the frequency of secondary symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal SAH (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). However, there is no evidence that tirilazad can improve long-term clinical outcome as assessed with death from any cause or overall poor outcome. There is also a lack of evidence that tirilazad can reduce incidence of cerebral infarction due to symptomatic vasospasm. The results are consistent with a previous meta-analysis which included only four trials identified in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rosengart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosengart 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from individual trials suggested that tirilazad might be efficacious in patients with more serious neurological deficit and when given at a higher dose, especially in women due to their different metabolic mechanism (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>). One previous systematic review of tirilazad also drew the same conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Dorsch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorsch 2001</LINK>): in four trials, which were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kassell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>), only data on male patients treated with tirilazad at a dose of 6 mg/kg and female patients treated with tirilazad at a dose of 15 mg/kg were pooled. In our review, we performed preset subgroup analyses to test the effects of tirilazad. The results showed that when data from all trials were included there is no significant effect of tirilazad on clinical outcomes in any subgroup.</P>
<P>We noticed that nimodipine was commonly used in all trials included in this review. There is sufficient evidence that nimodipine can reduce not only poor outcome (defined as death or dependency in activities of daily life) but also the frequency of secondary ischaemia after SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Dorhout-Mees-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorhout Mees 2007</LINK>). Thus, this review actually evaluated the effects of tirilazad in addition to nimodipine in SAH.</P>
<P>Multivariable analysis based on the data of included patients may help further understand the effects of tirilazad in patients with SAH by adjusting confounding factors. Three studies have analysed predictors of vasospasm (<LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 2003</LINK>), cerebral infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusen 2007</LINK>) and clinical outcome (the Glasgow Outcome Scale three months after SAH) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosengart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosengart 2007</LINK>) in patients with SAH. Data from four trials identified in this review were included in the analyses. However, whether patients received tirilazad or not was not regarded as a prognostic variable participating in multivariable analysis. Therefore, these three studies provide no usable information on the effects of tirilazad for SAH.</P>
<P>This review found no evidence to support tirilazad as a neuroprotectant to be routinely used in the treatment of patients with SAH. The situation is similar to tirilazad for ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-TISC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">TISC 2001</LINK>) and TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>): there were promising results from experimental studies but no evidence of beneficial effects from randomised controlled trials. In the future, Donnan's recommendation of a road map for developing new neuroprotectants for stroke, including better proof of efficacy in animal models, in vivo evidence of efficacy in human tissue using cell cultures or brain slices, and the demonstration of efficacy in novel human models of cerebral ischaemia, before undertaking large sample trials should be adopted when developing new neuroprotectants for SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Donnan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnan 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In this review, limited data from the included trials showed that tirilazad has no more adverse effects than its placebo regarding infusion site disorders. However, the highest incidence of infusion site disorders reached 37% (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1997</LINK>) in both groups and 1.2% of patients discontinued trial drugs because of the adverse events. Thus, the infusion site disorders, whether due to tirilazad or the placebo, can not be ignored when considering compliance of tirilazad in clinical practice. For adverse effects of tirilazad on laboratory parameters, it seems that tirilazad is a safe treatment when given at low or moderate doses. There were significantly more patients with leukocytosis and prolongation of Q-T interval in electrocardiogram when tirilazad was given at a high dose (15 mg/kg), but the results were based on data from just one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999b</LINK>) and were not reported in another trial using same dose of tirilazad (<LINK REF="STD-Lanzino-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lanzino 1999a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological issues of the present review</HEADING>
<P>Two limitations in this review should be noted:</P>
<OL>
<LI>we did not successfully contact the pharmaceutical company who manufactured tirilazad, nor were unpublished trials identified if there are any;</LI>
<LI>data from patients who did not receive trial drugs after randomisation and patients who were lost to follow up in included trials were not available for performing an intention-to-treat analysis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>However, we do not think that the above limitations bias our major conclusions for the following reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>it is unlikely that there were unpublished trials with positive results and high methodological quality;</LI>
<LI>the number of patients with missing data is too small to bias the results of the analysis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Furtheremore, when we did best-case-scenario analyses to test the effect of patients lost to follow up on the primary outcome, the result did not change significantly when patients lost to follow up in the tirilazad group were treated as being alive whereas patients lost to follow up in the control group were treated as being dead. Nevertheless, future trials should present their data in detail for re-analysis such as meta-analyses.</P>

<P>As there have been five double-blind randomised controlled trials with an adequate number of patients to test for clinically meaningful differences between tirilazad and placebo, it is not helpful to conduct further similar trials. New trials of tirilazad or other neuroprotectants for SAH should be conducted only after their efficacies are certified by new rigorous evidence in pre-clinical studies.</P>
