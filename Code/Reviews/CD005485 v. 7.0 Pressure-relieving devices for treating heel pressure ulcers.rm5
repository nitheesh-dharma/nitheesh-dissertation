<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue, believed to be caused by pressure, shear or friction. Pressure-relieving devices such as beds, mattresses, heel troughs, splints and pillows are used as part of the treatment to reduce or relieve the pressure on the ulcer. Heel ulcers were studied specifically as their structure is very different to the other body sites which are prone to pressure ulcers (such as the bottom) and they are more prone to diseases, such as poor circulation, which do not affect other pressure ulcer sites. We identified one study that was at moderate to high risk of bias. This study lost over half the participants to follow up. More high quality research is needed to inform the selection of pressure relieving devices to treat pressure ulcers of the heel.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology of pressure ulcers</HEADING>
<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue, believed to be caused by pressure, shear or friction (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1997</LINK>). They usually occur over bony prominences, such as the heel, where there is little soft tissue, in particular subcutaneous fat, to provide mobility and padding. Animal studies show the severity of tissue damage to be proportional to the time and intensity of the pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>). This has also been shown to apply to humans in a study of people with spinal injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Reswick-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reswick 1976</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Size of the problem</HEADING>
<P>Pressure ulcers cause major morbidity and reduce the quality of life for participants and their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Essex-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essex 2009</LINK>). The financial costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS) are also substantial. In the UK, the cost of preventing and treating pressure ulcers in a 600-bedded large general hospital was estimated at between GBP £600,000 and £3 million per year (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1994</LINK>). Most published data on the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers come from hospital populations. In the UK, pressure ulcer prevalence ranges from 5% to 32% and incidence from 2% to 29% depending on setting and case mix (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of pressure ulcers are found on the lower body including the feet. Although pressure ulcers of the sacral or buttock region are the most common (<LINK REF="REF-Dealey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dealey 1991</LINK>) the heels are frequently reported as affected (<LINK REF="REF-Dealey-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dealey 1991a</LINK>). In the UK most NHS Trusts collect data on the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers. Repeated annual prevalence surveys from one UK hospital revealed that up to one-quarter of all pressure ulcers were located on the heel (based on 19% to 26% in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heel pressure ulcers</HEADING>
<P>Heel ulcers are rarely the focus of research and furthermore most research is focused on reducing the risk of pressure ulcer development (i.e. prevention) rather than the treatment of active ulceration. Treatment strategies (for example, nutritional support) are generally based on the extrapolation of prevention research. This evidence is sparse and of generally poor quality and there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of nutritional supplements in prevention, and particularly treatment, of pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2003</LINK>). The use of local pressure relief through support surfaces has been studied as a preventative intervention (<LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2011</LINK>). The continued use of support surfaces, even when a pressure ulcer has occurred, is advocated to prevent further damage (<LINK REF="REF-RCN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2005</LINK>).<B> </B>It is thought that people with diabetes may be particularly susceptible to pressure ulcers of the foot and indeed diabetic foot ulcers are wounds which occur anywhere on the feet; they may occur on the heel and be pressure-related. There are two Cochrane systematic reviews on preventing and treating diabetic foot ulcers but these do not define foot ulcer and so may include pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valk 2010</LINK>). Neither of the reviews looked at heel ulcers as a subgroup. Since heel ulcers may represent a distinct clinical entity, in terms of risk and responses to treatment, they are worthy of specific scrutiny.</P>
<P>The feet are distinct from other body sites for the following reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>They are designed for weight-bearing, with thickened dermis on the sole of the foot. This means that the skin has a relatively high number of collagen and elastic fibres to allow extensibility and elasticity and Pacinian corpuscles to identify pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Thoolen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoolen 2000</LINK>) compared to skin found on most other areas of the body.</LI>
<LI>The circulation to the lower limbs often becomes compromised due to arterial diseases such as atherosclerosis. Although associated with increasing age (<LINK REF="REF-Vogt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogt 1992</LINK>), poor circulation is seen in younger people, particularly in association with risk factors such as smoking, diabetes and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Vogt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogt 1992</LINK>). The internal capillary pressures reduce and if subjected to external pressure are not able to respond appropriately to prevent occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Kannell-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannell 1973</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Neuropathy (reduced or altered sensation) has been identified as a risk factor for ulceration in the feet of people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-McNeeley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeeley 1995</LINK>). Neuropathy is also known to be associated with other diseases such as stroke, pernicious anaemia, spina bifida and multiple sclerosis although its precise prevalence is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Neale-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neale 1981</LINK>). Although no published papers have been identified so far, data collected during a study on pain in leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2003</LINK>) has shown that many elderly people have some degree of neuropathy of the lower limbs. The presence of neuropathy may result in a person being unaware of pressure and, therefore, not responding to it (<LINK REF="REF-Raney-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raney 1989</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Oedema is the presence of excess extracellular fluid which causes localised swelling. It is associated with peripheral vascular disease, the effects of gravity on a dependent limb and other physiological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Ciocon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciocon 1993</LINK>). The presence of oedema compromises tissue perfusion and removal of waste products (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 1969</LINK>). Also, the weight of the extra fluid in the feet is likely to result in normal resting pressures being exceeded, which may have an impact on tissue tolerance of pressure.</LI>
<LI>The absence of sebaceous glands on the sole of the foot results in a lack of lubrication of the skin; this may increase the likelihood of friction damage (<LINK REF="REF-Tortora-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tortora 1996</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The superficial fascia is dense over the heel and contains loci of fat in facial pockets. Although this provides added protection from pressure, the effect of exceeding normal tissue tolerance has not been identified. This is likely to affect the response to pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Tortora-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tortora 1996</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The presence of arterial disease and neuropathy may have an impact on the tolerance of the heel in terms of the extent and duration of applied pressure. Clearly these pathologies are less likely to influence other pressure sites such as the sacrum or ischial tuberosities (parts of the pelvis prone to pressure ulcers). The review of heel pressure ulcers as a separate entity is, therefore, a worthy study.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-31 11:26:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Once a heel pressure ulcer has occurred, treatment is concerned with reducing exposure of the heel to pressure and the management of the wound. The management of the wound is outside the scope of this review.</P>
<P>Reducing the extent and duration of applied pressure is achieved by changing a person's position, using equipment which provides an overall reduced pressure or alternating periods of low and high pressure or both. Pressure-reducing supports can be for the whole body, for example mattresses, or specific to the body site such as foot protectors and booties. Most interventions are designed for pressure ulcer prevention; however, if an ulcer has occurred it is necessary to reduce the risks of further tissue breakdown.</P>
<P>Devices that reduce the magnitude of the applied pressure are thought to work by distributing body weight over a larger surface area, by conforming to the shape of the body generally or the heel specifically. These are known as constant low pressure devices (CLP). They vary in their construction, for example foam, gel, sheepskin, or an air-filled or water-filled device. Devices which reduce the duration of pressure use a system of air-filled cells (AP) which alternate between high and low pressure by inflation and deflation of alternate cells. Other devices remove pressure from the body site at risk, for example by supporting the foot or calf in a splint, using a foot trough or pillow that leaves the heel with no surface contact.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-28 09:48:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very little is known about the contribution of the reduction or relief of pressure to the wound-healing process. The rationale for this review is based on the assumption that the reduction of external pressure on the pressure ulcer will have a positive effect on the wound-healing process.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2000</LINK> study there was adequate sequence generation through computer-generated random numbers and allocation was concealed. Blinding of the participant and caregiver to interventions is not possible when equipment (from which the patient cannot be moved) is used as the allocation is visually obvious. Russell stated that to prevent bias, the monitoring of the data collection and protocol compliance was carried out by a team member who was 'blinded' to the statistical analysis, however data were collected by nurses who would not have been blind to the intervention. Incomplete outcome data were not adequately addressed; 72 out of the 113 patients (64%) died, were discharged or did not heal. The outcomes were ulcer healed, patients discharged or died but these were reported together as "completed study", which made interpretation difficult. The study reported baseline comparability of the two groups with respect to age, risk of developing pressure ulcers, grade and severity of pressure ulcer but did not report gender and duration of the pressure ulcers. Overall this study should be judged as at moderate risk of bias; many of the bias domains are satisfied but the very high drop-out rate would moderate the overall judgement.</P>

<P>This study (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2000</LINK>) randomised 141 people of whom 113 had heel pressure ulcers to one of two different alternating mattress replacement systems either the Huntleigh Nimbus 3 mattress (this has a 1 in 2 alternating cycle) and Aura cushion system (n = 70) or the Pegasus Cairwave (this has a 1 in 3 alternating cycle) mattress and Proactive cushion (n = 71).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of heel ulcers healed was not reported in the published study, therefore we have analysed data using both the study outcome of "completed study" and heel ulcers healed (based on additional data provided by the author).

<P>The outcome of "completed study" is defined as 'healed, discharged or died' at the end of the 18-month follow-up period. In the Nimbus group 24/55 participants and in the Cairwave group 17/58 participants healed. There was no significant difference when using either mattress system in the number of heel ulcers healed (RR 1.49; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.45)(<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a high risk of attrition bias as many people were lost to follow up: n = 17/55 (56%) in the Nimbus group and n = 27/58 (71%) in the Cairwave group were discharged or lost to follow up. Fourteen participants died in each group.</P>

<P>Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of pressure-relieving devices for healing pressure ulcers of the heel. Only one RCT met the inclusion criteria, it had high losses to follow up therefore findings need to be viewed with caution.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-30 16:31:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two non-English review papers were identified by the search process but no translation was requested as only the bibliographies of reviews were being checked for further citations. There may be a potential risk of language bias with this process. There could be a risk of publication bias as studies of pressure-relieving devices are frequently sponsored by the manufacturers. Results which show no difference or no benefit in their product may not be published. We contacted product manufacturers and experts in the field to reduce this risk.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comments on search strategy</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy was developed to include studies of participants with diabetic foot ulcers. There was a possibility that such studies may have included heel pressure ulcers. The list of titles generated did not include any diabetic foot ulcer papers. On reflection this may have been related to the fact that the strategy did not include the free-text term '(heel or foot or feet) near ulcer'. Discussion took place with the Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Wounds Group and we informally examined citations of treatment studies for foot ulcers in people with diabetes which were identified in other systematic reviews. Most of these were found to include only ulcers on the plantar surface of the foot or forefoot and some specifically excluded ulcers on the heels. The potential benefit of re-writing and running the strategy for all the years, in all the databases at this moment was not thought to justify the work entailed. This would, however, be a consideration for the future.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-02 15:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current guidelines for practice (<LINK REF="REF-RCN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2005</LINK>), based on a review of support surfaces for all pressure ulcers, recommend the use of pressure-relieving devices for all participants with pressure ulcers. Clinical staff, policy makers and users should be mindful that there is no evidence to support one support surface over another for heel pressure ulcers and consideration should be given to participants' quality of life (pain, discomfort, activity and mobility, intrusiveness (noise, size of device) as a priority as well as ease of use, reliability, and direct and indirect costs (purchase price, lifespan, maintenance).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-02 15:30:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clearly further well-designed trials of support surfaces (and in particular devices specifically for heel pressure relief) for treating heel pressure ulcers are needed. Consideration needs to be given to the populations to be studied; these need to include elderly, vascular, diabetic and orthopaedic participants in both hospital and community settings.</P>
<P>Recruiting sufficient participants to pressure ulcer studies can be difficult as many participants appear incapacitated. The high mortality rate in the pressure ulcer population is a major challenge when planning a trial. To ensure sufficient participants are followed up to complete healing will always be difficult. Potential solutions involve exclusion of participants who are likely to die in the short term, and use of survival analysis methods which can use data from patients up until the point of censoring (death). </P>
<P>In modern inpatient settings, the movement of participants between wards and early discharge to alternative care risks compromising data collection. Robust participant follow up with the continuation of the trial intervention needs to take place. Given the high mortality rates in participants with pressure ulcers, healing may not be the most important outcome of interest. More consideration should be given to what are traditionally considered to be secondary outcomes, such as participant quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.</P>
<P>The need to distinguish between the populations of participants with sacral, ischial and heel pressure ulcers remains. The risk factors for healing are different, as are the effects on their quality of life both of the ulcer and of the device used to treat it.</P>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> respectively. We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision). We combined the Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources</HEADING>
<P>We searched the bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications identified by these strategies for further studies. We contacted experts in the field and asked them if they had been involved in any further studies or were aware of recently completed or ongoing studies. We contacted manufacturers of pressure-relieving equipment to request any studies they may have conducted which include heel pressure ulcers. Other journals (<I>Phlebology</I> and <I>Diabetic Foot</I>), which we had originally intended to handsearch, are now indexed in MEDLINE, therefore we undertook no additional handsearching.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-18 21:13:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of &#8216;Low Risk&#8217; or &#8216;High Risk&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Low Risk&#8217; or &#8216;High Risk&#8217;. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.  Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Low Risk&#8217; or &#8216;High Risk&#8217;.</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>

<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of &#8216;Low Risk&#8217; or &#8216;High Risk&#8217; (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>
</UL>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.  Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Low Risk&#8217; or &#8216;High Risk&#8217;. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.  Other sources of potential bias</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalance; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
