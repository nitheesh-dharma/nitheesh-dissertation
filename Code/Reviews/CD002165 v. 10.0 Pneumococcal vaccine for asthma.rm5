<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Pneumonia is a serious illness for people who have asthma and pneumococcal vaccine has been studied to see if it reduces illness or death in those people. A thorough search for randomised controlled trials of pneumococcal vaccine in asthma has found only one small study in children which was not of high quality. This showed a reduction in the rate of asthma attacks from ten per year to seven per year. Randomised trials to test pneumococcal vaccine in asthmatic children and adults are needed to assess how beneficial it is for asthmatics to receive this vaccination.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-11 11:53:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of pneumonia and other serious illnesses, particularly amongst those with certain high-risk medical conditions. High-risk in this respect refers to those conditions that predispose to either increased risk of acquiring pneumococcal infection or adverse outcome following infection. Asthma is widely regarded as one such high-risk disease and there is some evidence in support this position (<LINK REF="REF-Salisbury-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salisbury 1996</LINK>). A recent retrospective study has shown that the presence of pre-existing lung disease is an important predictor of poor outcome in those with pneumococcal pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Marfan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marfan 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>The increasing problems of antibiotic resistance and immunodeficency have provided the catalyst for the development of pneumococcal vaccines and the subsequent health policy decisions regarding vaccination strategy. Pneumococcal vaccine is thought to protect against pneumococcal pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis. In some countries, it is recommended that all patients categorised as high-risk should be vaccinated (<LINK REF="REF-Salisbury-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salisbury 1996</LINK>). This position has been questioned, however, because of the paucity of evidence that asthmatics are at increased risk of pneumococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1982</LINK>) and the lack of evidence that vaccination confers benefit in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Sheikh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheikh 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is a need to review all the evidence for the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in asthmatics to inform policy decisions regarding vaccination strategy. This issue is particularly important in view of the high and rapidly increasing prevalence of asthma in many parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-ISAAC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISAAC 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The original electronic searches identified 15 abstracts; three of these were identified as potentially eligible trials and full copies of the papers were obtained. Two did not have a treatment control group and were therefore excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Lahood-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lahood 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1995</LINK>). The remaining trial satisfied the criteria for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1983</LINK>). Wyeth and Pasteur-Merieux distribute pneumococcal vaccine in the UK; contacting these companies did not identify any additional possible trials. An update search conducted in August 2009 did not yield any further studies, while a search in August 2010 identified one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2008</LINK>) which was not eligible for inclusion because there was neither a placebo nor treatment control arm.</P>
</SEARCH_RESULTS>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:33:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The main purpose of Schuller's study was to investigate the efficacy of a combination of prophylactic sulfisoxazole and pneumococcal immunisation in reducing episodes of otitis media in children with asthma. The trial recruited 80 asthmatic children, aged 2- 6 years, of whom 61% were male. Children were recruited from a paediatric allergy clinic and were included if they had bronchial asthma beginning at least six months prior to enrolment and had four or more physician diagnosed episodes of otitis media. Subjects were followed up for two years after being randomly assigned to one of five treatment arms:</P>
<OL>
<LI>no prophylactic medication (the control group)</LI>
<LI>antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate, dose and frequency of administration not stated) whenever nasally congested</LI>
<LI>daily sulfisoxazole 500 mg twice-daily (one-third were given pneumococcal vaccine after the first year)</LI>
<LI>pneumococcal vaccination (one-third were given sulfisoxazole 500 mg twice-daily during the second year)</LI>
<LI>both pneumococcal vaccine and sulfisoxazole (500 mg twice-daily) from the outset of the study</LI>
</OL>
<P>The primary outcome measure of interest was the number of confirmed episodes of otitis media. Two secondary outcomes were also reported: acute asthma attacks and hospitalisations for asthma.</P>
</INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The trial did not describe the methods of randomisation nor those for concealing allocation. There was no information provided on whether those responsible for data entry and analysis were blinded with respect to treatment allocation. Because of the nature of the interventions, participants could not be blinded to their treatment allocation. This trial was rated as having a Jadad score of one. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:33:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Seventy two (90%) children completed the two-year study; two children moved away from the area and six were deemed non-compliant in taking their medication (no details are provided on the trial arms from which losses to follow-up occurred). There were 12 children in treatment arms one, two and five, and 18 children in arms three and four.</P>
<P>The incidence of asthma attacks, where an asthma attack is defined as bronchospasm associated with a febrile illness, was 10.1 per child per year amongst those in group one (control group) during the two-year study period. Children in group four (n=18) treated only with pneumococcal vaccination are the most relevant comparative group from which to assess pneumococcal vaccine efficacy. All eighteen children in this group were treated with vaccine alone in the first year, results indicating that vaccination conferred significant benefit in reducing incidence of asthma attacks when compared with controls (7.3 per child in year one; SD not presented; p&lt;0.05). In the subgroup (n=12) of children who received no additional treatment during the second year, vaccination maintained benefit (incidence of asthma attacks 7.0 per child in year two; SD not presented; p&lt;0.05), these changes representing a 27% and 30% reduction respectively in frequency of asthma attacks when compared to controls. The greatest reduction in incidence of asthma attacks was however seen in children in group five (n=12) who were treated with pneumococcal vaccination and daily sulfisoxazole. Incidence of asthma exacerbations was 4.5 per child during year one (SD not presented; p&lt;0.01) and 4.4 per child during year two (SD not presented; p&lt;0.01), these figures representing a 55% and 56% reduction respectively in frequency compared to that observed in controls. A significant reduction in asthma attacks was also seen in children in group three who were treated with daily sulfisoxazole (p&lt;0.05) but no similar benefit was observed in children in group two who were treated with antihistamines when nasally congested (p&gt;0.05).</P>
<P>The author also states that there was a 90% reduction (compared with controls) in the number of hospitalisations for wheezing associated with otitis media in children in group five (pneumococcal vaccination and daily sulfisoxazole); no summary data is presented. Furthermore, no information is available about incidence of asthma related hospital admissions in any of the other groups.</P>
<P>Incidence of otitis media in children in group one (control group), was 5.1 episodes of otitis media per child during the first year, and 4.7 episodes per child during the second year. Children in group two (antihistamines whenever nasally congested) experienced an 11% reduction in incidence of otitis media during the first year of the study and a 12% reduction during the second year of the study compared to group one; these differences were not however significant at the 5% level. Children in treatment groups three, four, and five all had significant reductions (p&lt;0.05) in the incidence of otitis media during the study period with the greatest reduction seen in children who from the outset of the trial received both sulfisoxazole and pneumococcal vaccine (group five).</P>
<P>No major adverse events were reported in this study. The following mild reactions were however noted in those receiving pneumococcal vaccination: local arm soreness (35%), local erythema (11%) and fever less than 39 degrees Celsius (5%).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite a comprehensive literature search, we were only able to identify one randomised controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of prophylactic sulfisoxazole and pneumococcal vaccination in reducing incidence of otitis media in children with asthma. Methodological quality was assessed as being poor, the trial receiving a Jadad score of only one. Only the secondary outcomes of this trial are of direct relevance to this review. Presentation of results is incomplete, attempts at contacting the author for clarification proving unsuccessful; results nonetheless seem to suggest that pneumococcal vaccination may confer some benefit in reducing frequency of asthma exacerbations' and, when administered in conjunction with daily prophylactic sulfisoxazole, asthma related hospital admissions. Studying vaccine efficacy in a relatively small sub-set of asthmatic children (those with a history of recurrent otitis media), recruited from a specialist allergy clinic, it is difficult to know how generalisable the findings of this trial are to people with asthma in general. Furthermore, this trial provides no data on vaccine efficacy in reducing incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia or mortality from pneumococcal infection.</P>
<P>Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of pneumococcal vaccine efficacy have independently concluded that vaccination confers no benefit in the heterogeneous group of patients considered high-risk raising further questions about the appropriateness of routinely vaccinating people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The role of routine pneumococcal vaccination in people with asthma is unclear. This review found little evidence to justify routine vaccination of people with asthma. In children with a history of recurrent otitis media, one small study suggested that vaccination may reduce the incidence of otitis media and asthma exacerbations. </P>
<P>Lack of evidence of efficacy due to a paucity of trials should not be interpreted as implying that pneumococcal vaccination is ineffective in patients with asthma.</P>
