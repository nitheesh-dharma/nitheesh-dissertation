<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-03-18 14:03:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">Are stage-based interventions more effective than non-stage-based ones in helping smokers to quit?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 09:30:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The transtheoretical model is one of several stage-based theories of behaviour change. It suggests that smokers move through a series of motivational stages before they manage to stop smoking. These are <I>precontemplation</I> (no thoughts of quitting), <I>contemplation</I> (thinking about quitting), <I>preparation</I> (planning to quit in the next 30 days), <I>action</I> (quitting successfully for up to six months), and <I>maintenance</I> (no smoking for more than six months). According to this widely-known theory, programmes which help people to stop smoking should be matched to their stage of readiness to quit. They are designed to move them forward through the stages to eventual success. In this review, we have compared stage-based programmes of smoking cessation with standard (unstaged) programmes, or with 'usual care', or with assessment only. We found 41 stage-based trials, covering more than 33,000 smokers, which measured quit rates at least six months after treatment. Only four of the 41 trials directly compared the same intervention in a standard and a stage-based version. This showed that the stage-based version was neither more nor less effective than the standard one. Eighteen trials which compared stage-based self-help programmes with any control condition showed better success rates for the intervention groups. Thirteen trials of stage-based individual counselling versus any control condition showed a similar benefit for the intervention groups. These findings confirm the known effectiveness of these interventions, whether staged or unstaged. The evidence was less clear on the effects of stage-based telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of doctors and helpers. This uncertainty may be due in part to smaller numbers of trials. We find on the evidence from this review that providing self-help or counselling support to smokers trying to quit is more effective than 'usual care' or simple observation. However, the extra value of fitting that support to the smoker's stage of change is currently unclear.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:13:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The transtheoretical model is the most widely known of several stage-based theories of behaviour. It proposes that smokers move through a discrete series of motivational stages before they quit successfully. These are <I>precontemplation</I> (no thoughts of quitting), <I>contemplation</I> (thinking about quitting), <I>preparation</I> (planning to quit in the next 30 days), <I>action</I> (quitting successfully for up to six months), and <I>maintenance</I> (no smoking for more than six months). According to this influential model, interventions which help people to stop smoking should be tailored to their stage of readiness to quit, and are designed to move them forward through subsequent stages to eventual success. People in the preparation and action stages of quitting would require different types of support from those in precontemplation or contemplation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-03-18 12:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Our primary objective was to test the effectiveness of stage-based interventions in helping smokers to quit.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-09-14 08:21:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('stage* of change', 'transtheoretical model*', 'trans-theoretical model*, 'precaution adoption model*', 'health action model', 'processes of change questionnaire*', 'readiness to change', 'tailor*') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. The latest search was in August 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:13:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials, which compared stage-based interventions with non-stage-based controls, with 'usual care' or with assessment only. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment, and those which measured stage of change but did not modify their intervention in the light of it.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-02 09:47:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the dose and duration of intervention, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up.</P>
<P>The main outcome was abstinence from smoking for at least six months. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to estimate a pooled risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>We found 41 trials (&gt;33,000 participants) which met our inclusion criteria. Four trials, which directly compared the same intervention in stage-based and standard versions, found no clear advantage for the staging component. Stage-based versus standard self-help materials (two trials) gave a relative risk (RR) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.39). Stage-based versus standard counselling (two trials) gave a relative risk of 1.00 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.22). Six trials of stage-based self-help systems versus any standard self-help support demonstrated a benefit for the staged groups, with an RR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.59). Twelve trials comparing stage-based self help with 'usual care' or assessment-only gave an RR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). Thirteen trials of stage-based individual counselling versus any control condition gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.42). These findings are consistent with the proven effectiveness of these interventions in their non-stage-based versions. The evidence was unclear for telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of doctors or lay supporters. This uncertainty may be due in part to smaller numbers of trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:13:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Based on four trials using direct comparisons, stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents. Thirty-one trials of stage-based self help or counselling interventions versus any control condition demonstrated levels of effectiveness which were comparable with their non-stage-based counterparts. Providing these forms of practical support to those trying to quit appears to be more productive than not intervening. However, the additional value of adapting the intervention to the smoker's stage of change is uncertain. The evidence is not clear for other types of staged intervention, including telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes and training of physicians or lay supporters. The evidence does not support the restriction of quitting advice and encouragement only to those smokers perceived to be in the preparation and action stages.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:13:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Almost five million people worldwide die prematurely from smoking each year. If current trends continue, this will rise to 10 million within 10 years, with 70% of those deaths occurring within the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-FCTC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO FCTC 2000</LINK>). It has been estimated that between 1950 and 2000, 60 million people have died from tobacco-related diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1994</LINK>). In the USA alone, smoking now kills around 512,000 people a year. These premature deaths from smoking on average amount to each individual losing 23 years of life (<LINK REF="REF-CTSU-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTSU 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Smokers are also at increased risk of a number of non-lethal illnesses, including cataracts, Crohn's disease, depression, diabetes Type 2, impotence, visual impairment, osteoporosis and tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-ACSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSH 2003</LINK>). They suffer increased fertility problems, and aggravated symptoms of asthma, chronic rhinitis, diabetic retinopathy, Graves' disease, multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis (<LINK REF="REF-ACSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSH 2003</LINK>). However, stopping smoking before middle age avoids more than 90% of the risk attributable to smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of established aids to smoking cessation, including a range of pharmacotherapies (nicotine replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2008</LINK>), bupropion (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2007</LINK>), varenicline (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2008</LINK>)) and behavioural approaches (group or individual counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005a</LINK>), self-help materials (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005b</LINK>)). One widely-used behavioural approach is the 'stages of change' or transtheoretical model (TTM), propounded by Prochaska and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1997</LINK>). This approach assumes that smokers pass through a discrete series of motivational stages (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2001</LINK>):</P>
<P>
<I>Precontemplation:</I> the individual does not perceive their smoking to be a problem and has no intention of quitting in the foreseeable future (typically over the next six months).<BR/>
<I>Contemplation:</I> the individual is aware that their smoking is a problem, and is thinking seriously about overcoming it but has not committed to a course of action. Contemplators may state that they are seriously considering changing their behaviour within the next six months.<BR/>
<I>Preparation:</I> Individuals intend to take action within the next month, and have unsuccessfully taken action in the past year (there is some debate over the appropriateness of previous failure as a defining feature of this phase; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005a</LINK>).<BR/>
<I>Action:</I> the person makes overt behavioural changes to stop smoking, and has successfully altered their behaviour for a period of anything from one day to six months.<BR/>
<I>Maintenance: </I>the now ex-smoker works to prevent relapse and to consolidate their abstinence for more than six months.<BR/>
<I>Termination </I>(not always an explicit component of the model): the individual has completed the process of change; they have a high level of confidence across all high-risk situations and no temptation to relapse.</P>
<P>The model proposes that individuals move sequentially through the stages, but may revert to earlier stages before finally achieving complete abstinence. The authors also identify 10 strategies or 'processes of change', which help an individual to move through the quitting process, and which vary from stage to stage (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1988</LINK>). Other component variables of the model include decisional balance (weighing the pros and cons of maintaining current behaviour), situational temptations (managing scenarios in which one might lapse), and self-efficacy (the belief that one will be able to change one's behaviour). The theory assumes that an individual's stage of change can be accurately defined, so that the appropriate intervention can be offered, and that the stage will frequently be re-assessed and the intervention tailored accordingly. It also propounds that incremental moves through the stages, independently of an active quit attempt, predict higher eventual levels of abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The stages of change model has been deployed for a number of therapeutic purposes. Its application to alcohol abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Project-MATCH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Project MATCH 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Project-MATCH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Project MATCH 1998</LINK>), to physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Blissmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blissmer 2002</LINK>) and to radon testing (<LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1998</LINK>) have all been explored elsewhere. Similar models of behaviour change were hypothesised concurrently with the development of the TTM, including the Precaution Adoption model (<LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1988</LINK>), and the Health Action model (<LINK REF="REF-Tones-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tones 1987</LINK>). The stages of change model has remained influential in the development of current guidelines for clinical practice. It remains standard practice to set a quit date during supported cessation attempts, on the assumption that abrupt or spontaneous quit attempts are less likely to succeed (cf. <LINK REF="REF-Larabie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larabie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2006</LINK>). However, the conceptual validity and the practical usefulness of the stages of change model for smoking cessation have been challenged over recent years, and a number of systematic reviews of trials based on the model have produced inconsistent or negative findings (<LINK REF="REF-Froelicher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froelicher 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Littell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riemsma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riemsma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Sluijs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Sluijs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bridle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herzog-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzog 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herzog-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzog 2010</LINK>). Our review is intended to contribute to this process of testing the application and value of the model for smoking cessation.</P>

<P>Any intervention using a stage-based design to influence a change in smoking behaviour. We have attempted to distinguish where possible, between those studies which substantively modify the intervention to fit the estimated state of change, and those which simply assess participants' stage of change or use the stage-based model to frame the approach without greatly affecting the content of the intervention. The latter group have not been treated as included studies.</P>

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-09-30 20:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome is smoking cessation at least six months after the start of the intervention, and longer wherever the data are reported. Many of the studies in this review are cessation induction studies, i.e. aiming to persuade mostly reluctant quitters to try and stop, and often supporting them as they make a quit attempt. Assessment of abstinence is therefore made after the period of cessation induction, where that distinction is reported.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes include any adverse effects of the interventions. We have not included movement through stages of change as an outcome of interest, since the primary concern of this review and of the included studies is achievement and maintenance of smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2006</LINK>). However, we consider movement through stages of change in the Discussion section, as a marker of the validity of the model for smoking cessation.</P>

<LI>Implementation issues, attrition rates, withdrawals/losses to follow up. Any differential loss to follow up by treatment group or by stage of change at baseline will be noted.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The primary outcome was the number of quitters at the longest follow up, and at least six months from the start of the intervention. We preferred, but did not require, biochemically validated quitting over self report, and measures of continuous or prolonged abstinence over point prevalence. We treated participants lost to follow up as continuing to smoke, and included them in an intention-to-treat analysis where possible. However, since many of the studies were population- rather than clinic-based, we also conducted sensitivity analyses to test different assumptions about the smoking status of those lost to follow up.</P>
<P>We describe and display results graphically as a risk ratio (RR: [number of quitters/total number of participants in intervention group] divided by [number of quitters/total number of participants in control group]) with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Analyses which included cluster-randomized trials have been conducted with and without adjustment for clustering. Adjustment for clustering generally delivered slightly wider confidence intervals. Where applicable both versions are reported in the Results section. The data, the interclass correlation and the design effects used for these trials are displayed in Additional Table 1.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We have included a brief discussion of secondary outcomes, including movement through stages of change.</P>
<P>We have assessed each included trial for methodological quality and for the quality of the implementation of the intervention, using the following questions:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was the method of randomization (sequence generation) reported and acceptable?</LI>
<LI>Was the method of allocation concealment reported and acceptable?</LI>
<LI>Were the intervention and control groups comparable at baseline? If not, were analyses adequately adjusted?</LI>
<LI>Were rates of attrition (during treatment) and loss to follow-up (post-treatment) at acceptable levels, and did they differ between groups ?</LI>
<LI>Did all groups get the same treatment apart from the intervention being tested?</LI>
<LI>Was stage of change assessed at baseline?</LI>
<LI>Was the stage of change instrument validated?</LI>
<LI>Was the intervention tailored to individual stage of change?</LI>
<LI>Was the quality and fidelity of the implementation reported?</LI>
<LI>Were the statistical methods appropriate?</LI>
<LI>Were details of the training of educators given, where applicable?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We have performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio and fixed-effect method, provided that there was no significant heterogeneity between the trials in their interventions, populations and design. We assess statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation between studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Values over 50% suggest moderate heterogeneity, and values over 75% substantial heterogeneity.<BR/>We have performed sub-group analyses based primarily on types of intervention, where such groupings can be made, with pooling of trials that use the same format for intervention.</P>

<P>We identified 41 trials for inclusion in our review. Full details of each trial are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. A further 58 trials did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review, and are briefly described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, with reasons for their exclusion. Seven additional trials could not be confirmed as meeting our inclusion criteria, and are listed as excluded because of insufficient information (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsoh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsoh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skewes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Skewes 2007</LINK>). One included study (<LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>) did not incorporate a non-stage-based control condition, and has therefore not contributed to the meta-analyses. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prokhorov-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prokhorov 2010</LINK>) have not yet reported their findings, and are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Fifteen of the included studies had more than one intervention arm. In two cases (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK>) we have meta-analysed the data under more than one category, where this could be done without pooling. For the remainder we have either combined intervention arms versus control or have selected the most informative comparison for this review. In each case, the selected comparisons are described in the 'Notes' field of the Included Studies table.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The transtheoretical or stages of change model is often used in conjunction with motivational interviewing (MI). In this review we have included studies which primarily test stage-based interventions for smoking cessation, whether or not they deployed MI techniques. Twelve of the included studies explicitly used some form of MI-based counselling in the delivery of their stage-based or control interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prokhorov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prokhorov 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>). Our review of motivational interviewing for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2010</LINK>) covers studies which concentrate on those interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK> is an included study for both reviews; <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK> is included in this review but excluded from the motivational interviewing review, as the impact of the MI counselling could not be isolated from other intervention components.</P>
<P>
<B>Settings</B>
<BR/>Twenty-one of the included studies were conducted in the USA. Five were in the UK, three each in Australia, the Netherlands and Germany, and one each in Belgium, Canada, Finland, Switzerland, Taiwan and Japan.<BR/>
<BR/>Eleven of the included studies were population-based. Nine were set in clinics or in out-patient departments, three in antenatal clinics and three on hospital wards. Five were set in family practices. Six were education-based, including three set in secondary schools, two in colleges and one accessing the parents of school children. Two trials were conducted through telephone quitlines, and two were set in worksites.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>We have grouped the included studies under six intervention types. Within these broad categories we have then examined them by the comparison condition, i.e. generic self-help, 'usual care', or assessment only. Additionally, four trials which used a non-smoking-related healthcare intervention as their comparator are treated for our purposes as assessment only.<BR/>
<BR/>1: <I>Tailored, computer-generated or 'expert system' letters</I> (18 trials):<BR/>(<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK> [Int 1]).<BR/>These are personalised reports or letters, usually produced electronically in response to baseline and follow-up questionnaires or interviews. They are matched to the participant's perceived stage of change, and may include self-help materials (tailored or standard) and/or follow-up phone calls. <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK> combined individual MI-based counselling with an expert system letter, but is included within this group for our review. Five of the studies were structured incrementally, i.e. augmenting the intervention components across a number of arms, compared with a non-staged control group (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>). This group of studies is discussed separately in the 'Effects of the Interventions' section below. <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> is not included in the meta-analyses, as it did not include a non-staged control group.</P>
<P>2. <I>Individual counselling or brief advice </I>(13 trials):<BR/>(<LINK REF="STD-Bobo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bobo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> [Arm B]; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK> [Int 2]; <LINK REF="STD-Prokhorov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prokhorov 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meysman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meysman 2010</LINK>). This is usually delivered by a physician or other healthcare worker, or by a trained counsellor, and often includes one or more follow-up phone calls or letters, to check progress and to reinforce the advice. The counselling is tailored to the participant's perceived stage of change. <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK> gave all participants a seven-week course of group counselling for smoking cessation, and then tested the addition of tailored versus generic phone counselling. <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> compared usual care (advice from a midwife) with stage-based manuals and counselling (Arm B), and with the same material presented as an interactive computer programme (Arm C). We have included each arm as a separate comparison. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK> compared assessment-only controls with stage-based tailored letters (Int 1) and with stage-based brief advice (Int 2). Each comparison is included in the relevant meta-analysis. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Prokhorov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prokhorov 2008</LINK>) combined individual counselling with biofeedback (lung function testing and measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide).</P>
<P>3. <I>Interactive computer programmes </I>(5 trials):<BR/>(<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escoffery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escoffery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> [Arm C]; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2008</LINK>).<BR/>These programmes are usually made available within a fixed time frame, and are often conducted at the participant's own pace. They may be supervised sessions, and generally provide oral or written feedback. <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> also delivered the material as a stage-based counselling intervention, and this is treated as a separate comparison (see <I>Individual Counselling</I> above).</P>
<P>4. <I>Telephone counselling</I> (2 trials):<BR/>(<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>).<BR/>Assessments and counselling are conducted entirely by phone, with advice tailored to the caller's stage of change.</P>
<P>5. <I>Training in the stages of change model for smoking cessation </I>(3 trials)<I>:</I>
<BR/>(<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK>).<BR/>These trials use rates of abstinence as surrogate markers for the effectiveness of the training.<BR/>(a) <I>Physicians</I>:<BR/>Two trials tested the training of physicians to deliver smoking cessation advice based on the stages of change model. Other outcomes included patient movement through stages of change and number of quit attempts (<LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1998</LINK>), and reduction in daily cigarette consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>).<BR/>(b) <I>Supporters</I>:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK> tested stages of change skills training for lay supporters of smokers trying to quit. Other outcomes included measures of supportive behaviour, acceptability of the programme and receptivity of the smoker to the supporter's attempts to help.<BR/>
</P>
<P>6. <I>Stage-based self-help materials </I>(1 trial):<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Pallonen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pallonen 1994</LINK> provided a manual to participants at six-month intervals, matched to their stage of change. Many of the trials also supplied generic or tailored self-help materials to their participants as part of the intervention programme, or as part of the control condition.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Comparison</B>
<BR/>The control or comparison conditions for the trials included generic self-help materials or services (12 trials), 'usual care' (13 trials), and assessment only (12 trials). Four trials used a non-smoking-related healthcare intervention as the control condition. These were dietary advice (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>), advice on diet, hypertension or stress management (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>), a health risk assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2008</LINK>), and advice on hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2004</LINK>). For our analyses, we have combined the assessment only and the non-smoking-related healthcare intervention groups.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Follow-up assessment</B>
<BR/>All the included studies followed up their participants for at least six months. Nine trials followed up for a maximum of 12 months, nine for between 13 and 18 months, and ten for two years. We have used the longest available follow-up measurement for our analyses.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Validation of abstinence</B>
<BR/>The majority of the trials relied upon self-reported abstinence rates. Five studies validated their outcomes by salivary cotinine samples (<LINK REF="STD-Bobo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bobo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK>), one by expired carbon monoxide (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2004</LINK>), and two by combining carbon monoxide with cotinine testing (<LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>). Two further studies achieved partially validated results, with <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> testing at intermediate but not at longest follow ups. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK>) used the 'bogus pipeline' method, i.e. collecting biological samples for validation but not testing them, and two of these cross-checked self-report against the testimony of family or friends.</P>
<P>
<B>Stages of Change model</B>
<BR/>The generic five-stage transtheoretical model, with its associated processes of change, decisional balance and temptation/self-efficacy, is fully described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Velicer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velicer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CPRC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPRC 1998</LINK>). This model has been variously applied and adapted in the studies covered by this review. Although the stages are generally expressed as discrete steps, the process has also been depicted as a spiral (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>), as cyclical (switching between quitting and relapse; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2004</LINK>), or as a contemplation ladder (<LINK REF="REF-Biener-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biener 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK>), to indicate the likelihood of progression and relapse before achieving behavioural change.</P>
<P>The concept has been reconfigured as 'perspectives on change' (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>), representing the stages as: 'disengaged' (precontemplation and contemplation); 'engaged' (preparation, with a quit date between 15 and 30 days away); 'committed' (preparation, with a quit date set within the next 14 days); 'implementation' (action, during the first one or two weeks of quitting); 'consolidation' (maintenance, from end of implementation to decline of urges to smoke or concurrent nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)); 'synthesis' (maintenance or termination, less than daily urges to smoke and no NRT). <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK> loosened the parameter definitions to 'Not even thinking of quitting' (precontemplation); 'thinking of quitting some time in the near future' (contemplation); 'set a quit date or made a quit attempt' (action); 'successfully remained smokefree for an extended period (maintenance). <LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK> reclassified the stages as low, moderately or highly motivated to make a quit attempt. <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK> mapped the stages to patterns of smoking cessation among pregnant women. Many of the studies modified the individual stages, while preserving the conceptual model.<BR/>
<I>Precontemplation</I>:<BR/>The transtheoretical definition for this stage is 'Not thinking about quitting in the next six months'.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998c" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998c</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2004</LINK> both favoured an additional category, 'immotives', for those smokers not interested in quitting or not planning to quit in the foreseeable future. <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1998</LINK> subdivided the precontemplators into three groups, based on decisional balance (the pros and cons of change), while <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK> subgrouped them as never planning to quit, or planning to reduce but not quit, or thinking of quitting but not in the next six months. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK> classified the precontemplators into four groups, based on decisional balance and levels of self-efficacy.<BR/>
<I>Contemplation:</I>
<BR/>The transtheoretical definition for this stage is 'thinking about quitting within the next six months, but not in the next month'.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK> subdivided this group, based on positive versus mixed or negative decisional balance.<BR/>
<I>Preparation:</I>
<BR/>The transtheoretical definition of this stage is 'having made a 24-hour quit attempt in the past year and planning to stop within the next thirty days'.<BR/>A number of trials did not require a 24-hour quit attempt as a defining characteristic of this stage (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK> subdivided this group on decisional balance. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK> did not identify preparation as a separate stage, and defined action as setting a quit date or making a quit attempt. An earlier transtheoretical model had dropped the preparation stage (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1992</LINK>), but later reinstated it as an integral part of the concept.<BR/>

<P>There was considerable variation among the included trials' attempts to control for risk of bias. Assessment of the quality markers for the risk of bias in each trial are reported in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables, and are displayed in summary form in Figure 1. A funnel plot (not shown) for all the included studies did not suggest any significant risk of publication bias.<BR/>
<BR/>Randomization procedures, defined as sequence generation and allocation concealment, were performed and reported adequately in six trials, and included such techniques as computer-generated tables of random numbers, minimization, and allocation by sealed opaque envelopes. Five trials reported methods of sequence generation or allocation concealment which would be considered inadequate, including shuffling of questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>), assignment by an office assistant (<LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK>), alternate order of assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Escoffery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escoffery 2004</LINK>), and 'topping up' recruitment arms by extending catchment (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK> assigned participants to study arm by which week they attended over a three-week recruitment period. Frequent attenders were therefore more likely to be allocated to the assessment only (control) arm, or to the tailored letter arm.<BR/>The remaining trials either did not report their methods of randomization, or did not describe them in sufficient detail to be assessed.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants to study arm was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>). Blinding of randomization staff was reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>), of interviewers or counsellors by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>), of assessors by three trials ( <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>), and of all study personnel by <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses excluding trials rated as inadequately randomized, allocated or blinded did not demonstrate any significant change in the point estimates, although the confidence intervals had widened.</P>
<P>Other events which might have introduced bias included mixing up questionnaires between the recruitment waves (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>); an intervention response insufficient to make the three- and six-month data usable (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>); a low rate (55%) of intervention delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>); disparate drop-out rates between intervention and control groups (24% vs 8%) (<LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>); and physicians choosing to deliver the intervention to some members of the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK>), with consequent exclusion of their data from the trial analysis. Four trials which aimed to match self-help manuals to participants' stage of change supplied the appropriate manual plus all subsequent manuals in a single delivery, which may have weakened the specificity of the targeted intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001b</LINK>). A similar limitation may apply to <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK> (supplying a composite manual of eight stage-based units) and to <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> (supplying the complete course of six manuals). The degree of bias introduced in such cases would depend on the accompanying instructions, and on the participants' level of compliance.

<P>Studies varied in the type of staged intervention that they tested, in the intensity of the intervention, and in the comparison conditions that they used. We have therefore grouped them into their categories (described above), and then subgrouped each category by the comparison condition. We have preferred the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and have taken the longest reported follow-up period. We also analysed the trials for point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates where reported, at 6- or12-month follow up, but found no important differences between the two sets of analyses.</P>
<P>The most informative comparison for this review is between a generic or non-stage-based intervention and a similar stage-based version of comparable intensity. Very few of the included studies offered such data. For trials of self-help materials (expert systems, manuals, interactive computer programmes), two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>) included this comparison. The relative risk (RR) was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.39); <I>analysis 1.1</I>). For trials testing counselling (individual, with or without supplementary self-help materials), two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>) contributed to the comparison, returning an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; <I>analysis 1.2</I>). These findings demonstrate neither a beneficial nor a detrimental effect of stage-based over standard approaches.</P>
<P>
<B>Type of intervention:</B>
</P>
<P>1. <I>Tailored, computer-generated or 'expert system' letters</I>:<BR/>Eighteen trials tested stage-based expert systems or tailored self-help materials against any non-stage-based control group. <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> was not included in this analysis, since it did not have a non-stage-based comparison group, and shared one of its experimental groups with <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001b</LINK>. We subgrouped these trials on the comparison condition. The relative risk for stage-based versus any standard self-help materials was 1.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.59; <I>analysis 2.1.1; </I>PPA at 6 or 12 months: 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; six trials). This estimate was influenced by the positive findings of <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>, which had a RR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.63), and a weighting of 28% in the meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis removing this trial returned a RR of 1.07 (095% CI .79 to 1.41) and reduced the I<SUP>2</SUP> value (estimating heterogeneity) from 28% to 0%. For the 'usual care' controls the RR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.57; <I>analysis 2.1.2</I>), and for the assessment only controls 1.35 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.52; <I>analysis 2.1.3</I>). Early success for the intervention arm in <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>, the largest trial in analysis 2.1.3, was not sustained beyond the seven-month assessment; by 24 months the four-week point prevalence abstinence rates in both groups were similar (11.1% for the intervention group and 10.5% for the controls; P = 0.6).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Incremental tailored interventions</I>:<BR/>Five of the 18 trials compared a non-staged control group with increasing levels of staged intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>). A comparison of the cumulative effects of adding, for example, a counselling intervention to an expert system to stage-based manuals showed no clear trend in favour of the additional components, with only <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK> demonstrating an incremental benefit across the intervention groups (RRs increasing from 0.43 to 1.87, but confidence intervals including 1 in each case [<I>analyses not shown</I>]). There were no substantive differences between any arms compared with control in <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK> or in <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK> demonstrated a benefit at 18 months for the individualized feedback intervention over standard self-help manuals (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 5.24; <I>analysis not shown</I>), but no clear advantage for stage-based manuals or for additional phone counselling. Although <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> is not included in the meta-analyses because it lacked a non-staged control group, we conducted a separate analysis of this trial, to assess the effect of adding expert system letters to stage-based self-help manuals. The RR of 1.33 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) favoured the expert system component, while increasing the number of contacts conferred no additional benefit (<I>analyses not shown)</I>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>2. <I>Individual counselling or brief advice</I>:<BR/>Thirteen trials compared individual counselling (face-to-face or by phone) with any non-staged control condition. When this group of studies was subgrouped by comparison condition, only one of the findings demonstrated a modest advantage for the staged interventions. The RR for the standard self-help comparator group (three trials) was 1.33 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.78; <I>analysis 2.2.1</I>), for the 'usual care' comparator group (seven trials) 1.19 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.42; <I>analysis 2.2.2), </I>and for<I> </I>the assessment only comparator group (three trials) 1.28 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.73; <I>analysis 2.2.3)</I>. Six of the 13 trials in this group were cluster-randomized, and the analysis was redone using the generic inverse variance method. Relative risks on this basis were 1.20 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.55) for standard self help, 1.24 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.56) for 'usual care', and 1.43 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.17) for assessment only (<I>analysis 8</I>). Key data for the cluster randomized trials are given in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>3. <I>Interactive computer programmes</I>:<BR/>Five trials tested stage-based interactive computer programmes, although none used standard interactive programmes as a comparator. Subgrouping by comparison condition detected no conclusive benefit of this approach versus 'usual care' (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.59; <I>analysis 2.3.1</I> ), and versus assessment only (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.36; <I>analysis 2.3.2</I>). Two of the five trials were cluster-randomized, and the analysis was redone using the generic inverse variance method. The corresponding RRs were 1.14 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.63) for 'usual care', and 1.32 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.28) for assessment only.<BR/>
</P>
<P>4. <I>Telephone counselling</I>:<BR/>Two trials comparing staged telephone counselling with a control condition found no clear benefit for the staged intervention versus standard self help (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.82; <I>analysis 2.4.1</I>), or versus 'usual care' (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.89; <I>analysis 2.4.2</I>).</P>
<P>5. <I>Training in the stages of change model for smoking cessation:</I>
<BR/>(a) <I>Physicians</I>:<BR/>Two trials which tested the training of physicians to deliver stage-based smoking cessation advice against 'usual care' found no advantage for the intervention (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.50; <I>analysis 2.5.1</I>). <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1998</LINK> was cluster-randomized, and the data were reanalysed using the generic inverse variance method. This returned an adjusted RR of 1.33 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.63), the difference being mainly attributable to the redistribution of weighting associated with this statistical method.</P>
<P>(b) <I>Supporters</I>:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK>, testing stages of change skills training for lay supporters of smokers trying to quit, detected a possible benefit of the training (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 8.34; <I>analysis 2.6</I>), but the small numbers of participants and events (five quitters from 60 participants) meant that chance could not be ruled out.</P>
<P>6. <I>Stage-based self-help materials:</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Pallonen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pallonen 1994</LINK>, testing the provision of staged self-help materials versus assessment only, found a possible benefit of the intervention (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.13; <I>analysis 2.7</I>), but could not exclude the likelihood of this being a chance finding.</P>
<P>
<B>Validated outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Relative risks were similar between the studies which relied on self-reported abstinence (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.37) and those which biochemically validated claims of abstinence (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39; <I>analysis 3</I>). However, the quit rates for the validated studies were predictably lower compared with studies giving self-reported rates. The median control quit rate in the eight validated studies, and in the four 'bogus pipeline' trials, was four per cent, giving a median intervention quit rate (based on relative risk) of five per cent. The corresponding rates for the 29 self-reporting studies were medians of seven per cent for the controls and nine per cent for the intervention groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Use of pharmacotherapy</B>
</P>
<P>We excluded five studies which supplied or prescribed NRT, where appropriate, as part of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1996</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Cornuz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cornuz 2002</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Pisinger-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pisinger 2005</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2008</LINK>) .<BR/>Seven of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meysman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meysman 2010</LINK>) either recommended NRT to all participants or included a control condition (self-help or usual care) which was likely to advise the use of pharmacotherapies where appropriate. Four of the seven trials reported usage: <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2005</LINK> found no difference in uptake between intervention and control, while <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Meysman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meysman 2010</LINK> both reported lower usage by controls (6/56 participants and 4/14 quitters respectively) compared with intervention smokers (35/112 participants and 9/28 quitters respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Manfredi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manfredi 2004</LINK> left it to the discretion of each physician whether or not to prescribe NRT, and reported that fewer than 1% of participants used it. <LINK REF="STD-Pieterse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pieterse 2001</LINK> advised intervention participants to use NRT where appropriate but left it to control participants to raise it for discussion with their physician. In that trial, nicotine gum was used by 9.4% of participants, with no significant differences in usage between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK> reported that, although controls received no smoking cessation advice, 24.9% of intervention participants and 20.8% of controls (P = 0.008) reported having used NRT by the two-year follow up.</P>
<P>
<B>Dose-response effects</B>
</P>
<P>Although we have not included <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> in the meta-analyses for this review, it offers evidence that a single staged intervention can be as effective as two, three or six such contacts, and does not support a dose-response effect. <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK> found a positive relationship between quitting and the number of tailored letters received. Among those smoking at baseline, 6% of the recipients of one or two letters achieved six-month sustained abstinence, compared with 45% of those who received seven to ten letters, and 36% of those who received eleven or more letters (P &lt; 0.001). <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK> also observed a linear trend for rates of 4-week abstinence increasing with the number of counselling letters, from two per cent for no letter read to 32% for four or more letters read (P = 0.002). However, these observations may be instances of selection bias, and are examined further in the Discussion section below.</P>
<P>
<B>Match-mismatch studies</B>
</P>
<P>A few smoking cessation studies have sought to test the robustness of the transtheoretical model (TTM) by deliberately mismatching the intervention to the participants' stage of change.The assumption underpinning this approach is that standard interventions target people who are ready to make a quit attempt, i.e. those in preparation or action stages, while contemplators and precontemplators need different kinds of support, to move them through the stages towards action (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1997</LINK>). On this basis, precontemplators and contemplators would not be expected to benefit from standard interventions.</P>
<P>To explore this hypothesis, <LINK REF="REF-Aveyard-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aveyard 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2009</LINK> reanalysed the <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK> data, to compare the efficacy of the TTM versus standard materials in moving people from one stage to the next. They found that the combined TTM study arms were slightly but not significantly more likely to progress through the stages than the control arm. However, contrary to the TTM hypothesis, those in preparation were slightly more likely to make a positive change with the TTM interventions than with the standard materials, and the likelihood of quitting in the TTM arms compared with the control arm was higher for those in contemplation and precontemplation than for those in preparation, although none of these finding reached statistical significance. To account for these disparities, the authors mapped the content of the standard materials to the processes of change described by the TTM, and suggested that the standard manuals were "largely stage appropriate".</P>
<P>The same study group (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>) tested the TTM in an intervention for smoking cessation in pregnant women, and reported comparable findings. The relative benefits of the stage-based interventions were not greater for women in precontemplation or contemplation, but proved particularly effective for those in preparation, for whom they would be considered a mismatch. This study confirmed that the TTM intervention increased cessation rates, but did not support the appropriateness of the stage-matched materials to the predicted groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Quinlan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlan 2000</LINK> (an excluded study) randomized 92 young adult smokers to receive stage-matched manuals, stage mismatched manuals or assessment only, and found that the mismatched group performed better than the other two groups for every outcome. Fifty-four per cent of the mismatched group progressed through at least one stage, compared with 30% of the stage-matched group, and 35% of the assessment only control group.  Fourteen per cent of the mismatched group were abstinent at one month follow up, compared with three per cent of the matched group, and none in the assessment-only group. Although the results of this small trial failed to reach statistical significance, they do not endorse the practical application of the TTM to smoking cessation programmes.</P>
<P>Two studies by Dijkstra have also tested the plausibility of the stage-based model. <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998</LINK> randomized participants to receive (i) pros-of-quitting material appropriate to 'immotives' (i.e. those with no interest in quitting), or (ii) self-efficacy material appropriate to those preparing to quit, or (iii) both types of material, suitable for those in precontemplation or contemplation, or (iv) no intervention (the control group). The group that received both types of material had significantly more sustained quitters at 14 months than the control group (OR 3.74), leading the authors to conclude that smokers with varying readiness to quit can benefit from a combination of information on outcomes of quitting and of self-efficacy enhancement.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> tested the Social Cognitive Stage Model, which is inspired by and similar to the transtheoretical model, with forward stage transition as the primary outcome. Participants were randomized to (i) pros of quitting material (deemed appropriate for precontemplators), or (ii) reducing the cons of quitting (for contemplators), or self-efficacy materials (for preparers and ex-smokers). The study confirmed the highest percentage of transitions in the expected groups for precontemplators, contemplators and ex-smokers, but not for preparers, for whom the pros and cons materials proved a better match than the self-efficacy materials. Overall, matched materials accounted for 44.7% of movement, and mis-matched for 25.8% (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.85 to 4.35).</P>
<P>Other trials have reported findings which are inconsistent with the stages of change model. <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK> reported that 5% of precontemplators in the Phone group had achieved continuous abstinence at 21 months, compared with 2% of the contemplators. The groups in <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK> behaved predictably, apart from the precontemplator controls (standard manuals), who achieved a higher quit rate than the contemplators in the same group.</P>
<P>
<B>Movement through stages</B>
</P>
<P>Movement through the stages of change, without reference to quitting, was not a primary outcome of interest for this review. However, we briefly consider it here for the included studies, as a marker for the validity of the model for behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1996</LINK>). The evidence from the studies in this review was inconclusive. Seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prokhorov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prokhorov 2008</LINK>) confirmed the predicted transitions, although three of them assessed forward movement only. A further five studies did not confirm the expected movement through the stages <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). All five included regression to earlier stages as part of their assessments, with all except <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK> employing a mean change scoring system. Four additional studies detected contradictory or inconsistent patterns of movement through the stages (<LINK REF="STD-Pallonen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pallonen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The most rigorous comparisons that we offer in this review suggest that stage-based self-help materials (relative risk (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.39) and stage-based individual counselling (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22) are no more nor less effective than their generic or non-stage-based equivalents provided at a similar intensity. These findings are based on four trials which construct direct comparisons between the two approaches, involving 3255 participants.</P>
<P>We have also explored other included trials, which test stage-based interventions against a range of control conditions. Six trials (5947 participants) of stage-based self-help interventions, including manuals and expert systems, compared with generic self-help materials, demonstrated a modest benefit, with a RR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.59). Twelve trials (14,446 participants) of stage-based self-help interventions versus 'usual care' or assessment only found a RR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.48; <I>analysis not shown</I>). These estimates are compatible with the Cochrane review of self-help interventions for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005b</LINK>), which demonstrates a RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.39) for 19 trials of self-help materials versus minimal or no self help, and without supportive contact. However, such comparisons are indirect, and although they may be suggestive, their significance should not be overstated. Three trials of stage-based individual counselling (2035 participants), compared with generic self-help, conferred a marginal benefit, with a RR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.78). Pooling all 13 individual counselling studies, regardless of the control condition, produced a RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.42; <I>analysis not shown</I>), which is somewhat lower than the RR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.65) for 18 trials of counselling versus any control in the Cochrane review of individual behavioural counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005a</LINK>). Included studies testing stage-based telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of physicians and lay supporters were too few to offer meaningful comparisons with the relevant Cochrane reviews. Our findings suggest that established cessation interventions, including self-help materials, both tailored and standard, and individual counselling, work at the expected levels of effectiveness when delivered as stage-based interventions.</P>
<P>Evidence for a dose-response effect is currently unclear. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>) support the increased effectiveness of multiple contacts, while the large study <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> found no differences in outcome between single and multiple contacts. <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK> cautions against a simplistic interpretation of the 'more is better' approach, pointing out that the association between quitting and the number of counselling letters in his trial could be an instance of selection bias rather than a dose-response effect, since those with higher motivation to quit were more likely to request the letters. This may also be true for <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>, since the provision of the advisory letters was triggered by the participants' progress through the perspectives on change. The Etter trial also suffered from differential rates of attrition, with losses of 24% in the intervention group at six months, compared with 8% of the controls. Feedback indicated that intervention participants may have wearied of successive mailings, leading to higher attrition and potentially to an inverse dose-response effect.</P>
<P>The five studies which cumulated two or three stage-based components of increasing intensity to the baseline control condition did not demonstrate a clear dose-response trend. The first additional component increased the quit rates compared with controls in all cases except for <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>, but subsequent increments generally failed to establish the trend predicted by the model, and in some cases may have precipitated higher rates of drop-outs than the less intensive arms (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>). The evidence from our review lends little support for the increased effort and resources implicit in this stepped intervention approach.</P>
<P>The analyses in this review have been conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, wherever the data were available, i.e. including all participants randomized in their original groups. We excluded deaths where reported, but counted drop-outs and those lost to follow up as continuing smokers. While this approach may be appropriate for clinic- and counsellor-based intervention trials, and is recommended by the Russell Standard (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005b</LINK>), its applicability to population-based studies has been debated (<LINK REF="REF-Velicer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velicer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>). For the 11 population-based studies eligible for meta-analysis and the two telephone quitline studies, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to test the most conservative assumptions about the smoking status of those with missing data or lost to follow up. The ITT-based relative risk for the 13 studies was 1.21 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.36). We then tested the effect of including all randomized participants in the treatment groups (ITT analysis) versus only those who had follow-up data in the control groups (<I>per protocol</I> analysis). This has the effect of maintaining a conservative quit rate in the treatment group, but a more optimistic one in the control group. The analysis on this basis found little difference between the groups, with an RR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.98), marginally favouring the control groups. It should be emphasised that this approach makes relatively extreme assumptions about differential distribution of missing data in treatment and control groups, which inevitably reduce the relative risk.</P>
<P>To further test assumptions about missing data, we repeated all analyses on a <I>per protocol</I> basis, i.e. including data (where reported) only for those participants who complete the study. Relative risks remained similar; stage-based self-help interventions (18 trials, any control condition) returned a <I>per protocol</I> RR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.51; <I>analysis 7.1</I>), compared with the ITT-based RR of 1.31 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.45). For stage-based individual counselling (13 trials, any control condition), the <I>per protocol</I> RR was 1.26 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.44; <I>analysis 7.2</I>), compared with the ITT-based RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.42).</P>
<P>Although movement through the stages was not a primary outcome of interest for our review, it is a useful test of the validity of the transtheoretical model for behaviour change. To judge the value of the concept solely on numbers achieving abstinence would misrepresent the process and risk underestimating its effects. Evidence from the included studies in this review was unclear, and depended to some degree on what measures were used and whether regression to earlier stages was included in the calculation. Mean change scores were more sensitive to transition than percentages measured at different points in the study process, and took account of movement in both directions. The five studies which used this approach found little evidence for the predictive strength of the model, and our findings on this question remain speculative. However, it should be emphasised that the studies included in this review were selected for their relevance to smoking cessation outcomes, and not to test transition between stages.</P>
<P>Disparities noted in the match-mismatch studies are difficult to square with the theoretical model. Aveyard and colleagues have speculated that standard self-help materials may be more broadly applicable than the stages of change model assumes. They also question the stability of the baseline staging assessments, pointing out that in their trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aveyard-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aveyard 2009a</LINK>) 24% of the precontemplators (i.e. with no wish to quit within the next six months) actually made a quit attempt within three months. They conclude from their own studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>) that the intensity of the intervention for those ready to try and change may be more predictive of success than their baseline stage of change.</P>
<P>The logic of the transtheoretical model is that smokers should be assessed for their stage of change, and that interventions should then be tailored to their stage of readiness to quit. Forward transition is the primary goal rather than smoking cessation, and mismatched interventions are assumed to be a waste of resources and potentially counterproductive. The evidence from this review does not unequivocally support this modular and linear view of the quitting process, with trials frequently showing 'staged' smokers behaving unpredictably. A British Marketing Research Bureau survey in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-West-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2006</LINK>) reported that almost half of the most recent quit attempts among smokers and ex-smokers had involved no previous planning. Furthermore, the odds of unplanned quit attempts being more likely to succeed for at least six months than planned ones were 2.6 times greater (95% CI 1.9 to 3.6) for attempts made during the previous five years. While the findings of retrospective surveys may not be wholly reliable, spontaneous quit attempts such as these, by 'immotives' or 'precontemplators', are at odds with the assumptions underpinning the staged model, and may raise further questions about its validity and application.</P>
<P>Such discrepancies, together with the findings of the match-mismatch studies and the movement through stages, may be attributable to a number of factors. These include a flawed behavioural model, selective recall by survey participants, inaccurate stage assessments, or underestimation of the flexibility and fit of the standard comparators.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<UL>
<LI>Direct comparisons between the same intervention in a standard format or modified by stage of change, with each intervention delivered at a similar intensity, demonstrate neither a beneficial nor a detrimental effect of the staged approach. However, the current evidence base is underpowered, and precludes robust conclusions.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Offering practical support to smokers trying to quit delivers higher success rates than 'usual care' or assessing their smoking status, but the additional value of adapting the intervention to the smoker's stage of change is unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Expert systems, tailored self-help materials and individual counselling, appear to be as effective in a stage-based intervention as they are in a non-stage-based form.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The evidence is inconclusive for other types of stage-based intervention, including telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes and training of physicians or lay supporters.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The evidence does not support the restriction of quitting advice and encouragement only to those smokers assessed as being in the preparation and action stages.</LI>
</UL>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:23:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<UL>
<LI>Additional trials to test the value of modifying an intervention by stage of change are unlikely to alter the conclusions of this review.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Trials testing the use of the transtheoretical model in stage-matched self-help manuals should provide only those materials which match to the participant's current stage of change.</LI>

<TD>
<P>Lapse/slip</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.</P>
