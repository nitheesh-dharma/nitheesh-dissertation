<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-11 07:58:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence to support the assumption that the care of people with dementia in special care units (SCUs) is superior to care in traditional nursing units. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be found comparing the effect of SCUs against traditional nursing units in managing agitated behaviours in people suffering from dementia. This review has examined the results of non-RCTs. The findings about the outcomes of this review arise just from one study except for the outcome of "physical restraint use" at 6 months, which includes data from two studies. Selection bias is a major problem in non-RCTs, and confounds the limited evidence that favoured SCU care with regard to a decrease in agitated behaviour and in the use of physical restraints. A convincing case for the benefits of SCU care cannot be made and further studies are necessary.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-11 22:32:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The behavioural problems of people with dementia are often considered as one of the most challenging issues in caring. Special Care Units (SCUs) have flourished since the 1980s with the aim of taking care of dementia patients, usually those with Alzheimer's disease, and in particular for those with behavioural problems. Although lacking a standard definition, SCUs are usually situated within nursing homes and commonly include the features of trained staffing, special programming, a modified physical environment, and family involvement. The costs of SCUs are commonly higher than for 'standard' nursing home care. However, evaluations of the outcomes of SCUs have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review of this evidence is therefore warranted.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-08-11 22:33:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effect of SCUs on behavioural problems, mood, use of restraints and psychotropic medication in patients with dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), <I>The Cochrane Library,</I> MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 6 September 2007 using the search terms: Special Care Units or SCUs. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from major healthcare databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and LILACS as well as many ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources.</P>

<P>All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the outcomes of SCUs were compared against traditional nursing units (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities) were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewing authors independently read the full reports of the potentially eligible studies and selected those that met the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussions among the two reviewing authors. Final consensus was reached with input from a third member of the team when necessary. </P>

<P/>
<P/>
<P>No RCTs meeting the selection criteria were identified. Since it is unlikely, for ethical and practical reasons that an RCT of SCUs will be conducted, a systematic review of non-RCTs using the same protocol and criteria was conducted. There were eight non-RCTs that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Only four studies had data which could be extracted for pooling in meta-analysis.  Differences between comparator groups in these nonRCTs ? for example in severity of dementia - were not adequately adjusted for and were common in the trial which accounted for almost all of the positive outcomes of SCUs (Nobili, 2006)</P>
<P>All of the results of the outcomes came only from single studies except for "physical restraint use" at 6 months, which included data from two studies.  A small improvement in total Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, favouring SCU was noted in one study at 6, 12 and 18 months.  The use of physical restraints was less common in SCUs at 6 and 12 months (OR= 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.80), p=0.006; and OR=0.49 (0.27 to 0.88), p=0.02 respectively).  Patients in SCUs were less depressed at 3 months than those in traditional nursing home (WMD -6.30 (-7.88 to -4.72) Cornell points, p&lt;0.00001). There was only one observation that favoured the control group: a small but significant effect favouring traditional nursing home care was observed at 6 months in the mean number of psychotropic medications used (WMD 0.20, CI 0.00 to 0.40, z=1.96, P=0.05).</P>

<P/>
<P>There are no identified RCTs investigating the effects of SCUs on behavioural symptoms in dementia, and  no strong evidence of benefit from the available non-RCTs.  It is probably more important to implement best practice than to provide a specialized care environment.  The routine collection of data on behaviour, restraint and psychotropic drug use across multiple nursing home settings offers the best modality for formal evaluation of the benefit or otherwise of SCUs. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Healthcare condition in question</HEADING>
<P>In the 1980s, nursing homes in the United States (US) started to develop special care units (SCUs) to accommodate the special needs of people with dementia. Throughout the 1990s, SCUs increased in numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Aud-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aud 2005</LINK>). To date SCUs remain popular among long-term care providers. For instance, Foster described a SCU director's course offered by the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in the US. However, the efficacy of SCUs in bringing about positive outcomes as opposed to traditional units is still controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Behavioural problems are deemed to be the most challenging issue in the care of people with dementia. Formal caregivers believe placement in SCUs helps with such problems. SCUs commonly refer to specially designed residential care settings catering only for people with dementia or more specifically, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Staff assigned to work in SCUs are often specially trained in dementia care and therefore more tolerant of behavioural disturbances and expected to better manage behavioural problems. Despite continued interest in SCUs in the US, there is no uniform agreement on their characteristics, specific outcomes, or consumers' satisfaction with them (<LINK REF="REF-Parker_x002d_Oliver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker-Oliver 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The intervention</HEADING>
<P>The SCU is not a single intervention but a set of related interventions including features such as a unique staffing pattern, special programming, or environmental designs. To date, there is no standard definition of an SCU. However in the 1990s researchers began to deliberate and study what made a SCU different from a traditional nursing home or a skilled nursing facility. The following components were features consistently described as the defining characteristics of SCUs (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 1994</LINK>):</P>
<P>1.admission of residents with dementia and most often with AD,<BR/>2.special selection, training, and supervision of staff members,<BR/>3.specially designed activity programming,<BR/>4.family involvement, and<BR/>5.a specially designed physical environment that is segregated from other areas.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for the review</HEADING>
<P>Professional staff cite behavioural problems as one of the principal difficulties in caring for elderly patients with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Normann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Normann 1999</LINK>). Symptoms associated with behavioural problems in people with dementia can vary and may include aggression, screaming, restlessness, wandering, sexual disinhibition, hoarding, cursing, resistance to care and so on, However, environmental modifications and caregiver skill can minimize these problems (<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloane 1998</LINK>). SCUs for older adults with dementia were developed on the basis that a prosthetic physical environment and a supportive social environment would reduce excess disability and improve quality of life (QOL) (<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>). SCUs have often been perceived as the epitome of care for people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2000</LINK>) and are believed to facilitate the successful management of behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-Foley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the interest in and proliferation of SCUs in long-term care settings, the outcomes of SCUs are not without controversies. Some studies show associations between SCU environments and improvements or slowed decline in residents' self-care skills, social function, mobility, and affective responses while others reveal no particular benefits when compared with traditional units. <LINK REF="STD-Sand-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 1992</LINK> surveyed 103 long-term care facilities, of which 12 had SCUs, and reported significant differences in therapeutic approaches between the special care and traditional units. <LINK REF="STD-Sand-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 1992</LINK> documented that 92% of the SCUs sampled reported a decreased use of pharmacological restraint and 83% reported a decreased use in physical restraint. They also reported that residents became calmer, less disruptive, less agitated, and exhibited less physical violence following SCU admission. A number of studies echoed the findings of Sand et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Sloane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>). However, a lot of studies that claimed effectiveness are without a control group design, only comparing pre- and post-treatment outcomes (e.g., <LINK REF="REF-Bono-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bono 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellelli 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK> compared SCUs and traditional nursing units and found that the special care group demonstrated less decline in activities of daily living (ADL), more sustained interest in the environment, and less negative affect than residents in the traditional care settings. However, they observed no differences between groups in terms of concentration, memory, orientation, depression, or social withdrawal. They concluded that the QOL for adults with middle to late stage dementia is the same or better in a purpose-built and staffed facility than in traditional institutional settings.</P>
<P>Other studies found no proof of better outcomes when comparing SCUs with non-SCUs. Such studies have not always distinguished between SCUs with and without special environmental features. <LINK REF="STD-Chafetz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chafetz 1991</LINK> compared 12 SCU residents and eight residents of a separate but non-specialized NH unit. They rated cognitive ability and behaviour three times at a 28-week intervals, and their results indicate that there was no significant difference in behaviour or cognitive decline between the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1990</LINK> also concluded that no significant effects, whether positive or negative, could be attributed to SCU care in their study. Other studies reported SCUs as having little or no positive effect on residents' wandering, cognition, physical functions, and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inconsistencies in defining an SCU likely account for significant difficulties in determining outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Mayers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayers 1990</LINK> surveyed 305 nursing homes in the US state of Washington. One hundred and fifty-four homes responded, including 39 that offered SCUs. The findings showed that strategies for managing behavioural problems were greatly varied in SCUs. Further, another study reported similarities between SCUs and traditional nursing home units. In a statewide survey to compare services provided for residents with dementia in SCUs and non-SCUs in the US, the number and quality of services provided between the two types of service facilities were similar (<LINK REF="REF-Gerdner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Establishing a dementia SCU entails an allocation of resources. If the benefits to having a unit solely for people with dementia were greater than the costs incurred, then creating separate units would be prudent (<LINK REF="REF-Bass-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bass 2005</LINK>). Yet empirical evidence has been vague with regard to the outcomes of SCUs. Due to the ongoing interest in and establishment of SCUs despite the presence of conflicting evidence, it is therefore necessary to review the use of SCUs for the behavioural problems of people with dementia.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the outcomes of SCUs were compared against traditional nursing units (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities) were included. Because of the difficulty in recruiting participants in dementia care studies, no limit concerning the number of participants in the trials was set. A double-blind assessment was not a requisite for inclusion for review because allocation concealment is not possible. Studies where participants received more than one intervention sequentially were not included unless results obtained during the first treatment phase assessing the outcomes of SCU placement were clearly documented. However, no such studies were found. Included studies are those that comprise pre- and post-intervention testing with at least two time measurement points. Clinical trials that investigated the effect of a certain dimension (e.g., the physical attributes of the environment) of SCUs were excluded, as were case studies. Clinical trials that included dementia subjects who had no behavioural problems at baseline were included if onset of new agitated behaviour was an outcome measure of those trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention group</HEADING>
<P>The intervention group consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease or related disorders (ADRD). No other participant characteristics were fixed. SCUs commonly have their own admission criteria, and those with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia or AD are frequently admitted. The criteria used in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III (DSM-III) or IV (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1995</LINK>), International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>) or National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>) in diagnosing dementia and AD were used as the operational definitions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The first author screened the reports retrieved from the search, and discarded those papers that were clearly irrelevant on the basis of the title and/or the abstract. Similar reports discussing different dimensions of a study were treated as one study having two different reports. Two team members independently read the full report of the potentially eligible studies and selected those that met the inclusion criteria. Where discrepancies arose, the disagreement was discussed and resolved between the two team members. When a consensus could not be reached, a third member of the team was consulted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data was extracted from published or unpublished reports using the CDCIG template. The table included columns describing the dependent and independent measures of the primary and secondary outcome variables. The design of the studies, sample size, baseline characteristics of the subjects (e.g., age, gender ratio, types of dementia, cognitive and behavioural severity) and the results, recommendations, and future research directions were entered as appropriate. Data was extracted by one team member, who took note of specific details required by each column heading of a summary table. When queries about the data arose or when clarifications were required, another member looked up the full paper and worked with the member who extracted and input data to clarify the questions of concern. The original authors of the studies were contacted for any required data and also when clarifications were needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of studies</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the studies was assessed to minimize potential sources of systematic bias including selection, performance, attrition and detection biases. The criteria for assessment were those as outlined in section 6.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 4.2.5 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Other dimensions of quality assessment being considered included the recentness of the study, the breadth and depth of the critique of other studies, sample size, and the degree of specification of the experimental variables, the levels of data utilized, the appropriateness and specificity of the hypothesis testing, and the extent of extrapolation of the recommendations derived from the results.</P>
<P>Given the inconsistencies in how SCUs are defined and operated, the use of the SCU as an independent variable were also carefully assessed. Special attention was paid when examining studies that employed specific admission policies or operational protocols.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Many of the instruments that examine behavioural outcomes in SCU studies produce data that are continuous in nature, such as the scores of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI, <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1986</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). When the outcomes are standardized measures across studies, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was used. The standardized mean difference was used for outcomes measured differently across studies. The odds ratio (OR) was used for dichotomous data.</P>
<P>The test of heterogeneity was performed if appropriate to check for the presence of significant differences between the results of studies. If heterogeneity was not indicated, a fixed effect approach would be adopted in the analysis. If significant differences were observed, a subgroup analysis will be used to explore the differences.</P>
<P>In SCU studies of a longer duration when the results were presented for different follow-up periods, a number of different outcomes (e.g., selected primary and secondary outcomes) based on the follow-up periods were intended for performing separate analyses. The other option to obtain individual patient data and perform a time-to-event analysis that employs the whole follow-up for each patient was not performed due to the difficulties related to obtaining individual patient data from each reported study.</P>
<P>The statisticians of the universities were consulted on the appropriateness of the statistical analysis used for this systematic review. Statistical support was also sought from CDCIG.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Drafting the review</HEADING>
<P>Data was entered into RevMan according to the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 4.2.5 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Upon completion and publication, updates will be conducted every two years.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-04-12 16:00:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aforementioned searches located 28 studies. One of these was a duplicate (<LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1994</LINK>). After going through the abstracts, 13 studies unrelated to the review topic were excluded. Seven other studies investigated the effects of an intervention and clinical conditions other than dementia, or were not concerned with SCU care. Three studies examined an intervention model rather than comparing SCU and traditional nursing home outcomes and therefore did not meet the criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Matteson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matteson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 2001</LINK>). Four prospective cohort studies (<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nobili-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nobili 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1994</LINK>) examined the outcomes of SCU care as opposed to traditional nursing home care.</P>
<P>No randomized controlled trials were identified that met our criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK> was the only attempted RCT found. They investigated the effects of the SCU on the behaviours of residents with AD as compared with the effects of care of residents with AD in traditional units of a long-term care facility over a 24-month study period. Initially, the subjects were randomly assigned to an SCU, a traditional unit, and a control group to replace subjects lost from the experimental or traditional groups. Randomization was not maintained due to attrition mainly because of death. The causes of death were not mentioned. Intention-to-treat analysis was not mentioned.The study thus became a quasi-experimental non-equivalent groups design.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rationale for including non-RCTs in review</HEADING>
<P>No RCTs are found and therefore the review team examined the available evidence from non-RCTs. A number of factors render the random allocation of subjects in a controlled trial of SCU care highly challenging. First, in the US people with dementia admitted to an SCU are also more likely to be entering under private pay arrangements (<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>). Many SCUs charge residents a higher sum (<LINK REF="REF-Rovner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovner 1990</LINK>). Residents and families self-select into these settings, thus compromising random allocation. Unless there are specially funded demonstration projects, finding adequate controls is difficult because, in the US, nursing homes are primarily businesses (<LINK REF="REF-Rovner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovner 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other reason was ethical. SCUs have a number of special features believed to be good for residents with dementia. Ethical considerations precluded the possibility of randomizing admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>). It would be challenging to try to obtain informed consent from families to agree to have their loved ones be randomly allocated to SCUs or traditional care, when the general assumption is that SCU provides better care. People's perception does influence their willingness to participate in non-SCU.</P>
<P>The last reason is practical. Facilities that have SCUs but did not necessarily charge more, e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>, were unable to maintain random allocation because of deaths occurring among the treatment and control groups. There were no adequate waiting list residents as replacements. <LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK> had the same experience, that there was an insufficient number of people waiting to be admitted to the SCU within the window of time allotted for study recruitment. The above reasons need to be noted when evaluating the quality of evidence studying SCU care.</P>
<P>The same protocol and criteria were used in identifying the non-RCTs to be included for analysis. The non-RCTs had to have matched controls and with pre and post measures in order to be considered for inclusion. That is to say, the included studies are controlled before and after (CBA) studies.</P>
<P>The literature search conducted by the review team was done in accordance with the search strategies as stated in the aforementioned protocol up to 10 September 2007. There were 110 results out of 495,002 records for: "special care units in Title, Abstract or Keywords or SCU in Title, Abstract or Keywords in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials". Among the 110 results, seven were duplicates and 87 were eliminated by title since they were not related to SCUs for people with dementia, resulting in 16 potentially relevant studies. Among these 16 studies, eight were eliminated after going through their abstracts or full text either because they did not meet the types of studies, types of participants, and/or types of outcome measures stipulated. Eight potentially relevant studies remained. Apart from the above Cochrane search, further studies were searched from reference lists of the above identified articles and from Scopus (http://www.scopus.com), a citation database that locates studies citing the identified articles since 1996. A total of 29 studies were located in this round of searches.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> tabulates the search results for this non-RCT review. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> accounts for the number of eligible studies. Only four extra studies - <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Webber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weyerer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weyerer 2005</LINK> - were identified outside of the search of the Cochrane database. Together with the four studies identified from the CDCIG search (<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nobili-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nobili 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>), a total of eight non-RCTs were therefore included in this review.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1994</LINK> examined the occurrence of agitated behaviour. Agitated behaviour was measured by the agitation scale of the Functional Abilities Checklist (FAC). The FAC had five scales but only aggregated scores were reported and they were unavailable. <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK> was a quasi-experimental study examining the effects of a SCU on the incidence of catastrophic reactions and other behaviours with a sample of 13 SCU and nine traditional unit residents. Bimonthly data on catastrophic reactions and social interactions was collected for 12 months both prior to, and post-admission into the SCU. The outcomes were assessed by frequency counts and the data was available. <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK> was included but the data reported in <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1994</LINK> could not be included.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Webber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Webber 1995</LINK> compared the outcomes of residents with AD newly admitted to SCU and to traditional nursing homes in Northern California, US. Four SCUs and four traditional nursing homes participated in the study and the recruited sample had 22 residents. Both the residents and their caregivers were interviewed to measure the quality of care at the facility level and to assess resident outcomes for behavior, cognitive, and physical functioning. Data were collected at admission and again within six months. The authors used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) to assess cognitive functioning, the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS; <LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1982</LINK>) to assess staging of the disease, CMAI to assess agitation, and Minimum Data Set (MDS) subscales to assess activities of daily living. An in-house instrument was developed to document the level of resident participation in activities. Information on the use of physical and pharmacological restraints was obtained by chart reviews.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK> was a multi-national (Italy, France and Sweden) case-controlled study comparing the effectiveness of SCUs with more traditional nursing home in the management of behavioral disturbances in residents with dementia. Only the participants in Italy were reported in this paper. Thirty-one cases in the SCUs and 35 controls in traditional nursing homes were recruited from 43 long-term care facilities. The subjects were assessed seven to 14 days and three months after admission. Cognitive status was recorded using the MMSE. Behavioural status was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>) and the CMAI. Other instruments for evaluation included the Bedford Alzheimer's nursing severity scale (<LINK REF="REF-Volicer-1994c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volicer 1994c</LINK>), Barthel Index (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1965</LINK>), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Alexopoulos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexopoulos 1988</LINK>), and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS; <LINK REF="REF-Parmelee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmelee 1995</LINK>. The assessments were performed by the same assessor whenever possible.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK> studied a nationally representative sample of SCUs. They examined a sample of newly admitted nursing home residents with dementia from 1992 to 1994 for 18 months to investigate whether SCUs were more effective in reducing physically aggressive behaviours within 6-months of placement. Data were collected through baseline assessment and 6-month telephone interviews with family members and facility staff, and a review of medical records. The outcome measures included a seven-item subscale developed from the CMAI, and the use of physical restraint and psychotropic medication.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK> compared the five dimensions of care (preadmission and admission procedures, staff training and education, nonuse of physical and chemical restraints, flexible care routines and resident relevant activities, and the environment) between SCUs and non-SCUs settings. The primary purpose of their study was to examine whether these dimensions of care clustered in SCUs or non-SCUs. They also investigated the outcomes of dementia sufferers in these two different settings over a period of 12 months. The sample had 501 subjects in 77 intermediate care facilities throughout the province of British Columbia, Canada. The outcome measure for agitation was the 14-item CMAI and for mood, the Feeling Tone Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Toner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toner 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK> compared the effect of SCUs with that of traditional nursing homes on the quality of life (QOL) of residents with middle- to late-stage dementia over a one-year period. It had a prospective, matched-group design assessing QOL every three months for a year. Twenty-four long-term care centres and four designated assisted living environments in an urban centre in western Canada were recruited. The sample had 185 residents, with 62 in the intervention group and 123 in the traditional nursing home group. QOL outcomes included the Brief Cognitive Rating Scale (BCRS, <LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1988a</LINK>), Functional Assessment Staging (<LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1988b</LINK>), the CMAI, the Pleasant Events Scale - AD (<LINK REF="REF-Logsdon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logsdon 1997</LINK>), the Multidimensional Observation Scale of Elderly Subjects (MOSES, <LINK REF="REF-Helmes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helmes 1988</LINK>), and the Apparent Affect Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weyerer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weyerer 2005</LINK> was a prospective cohort study that examined two main questions. First, the authors aimed to find out the degree to which the quality of life and care for patients with dementia differed according to the type of care provided (segregative versus integrative approaches in nursing homes. Second, they would like to examine the differences between SCUs care in Hamburg, Germany, as opposed to the traditionally integrative care of dementia patients in Mannheim, Germany. Hamburg was the intervention site whereas Mannheim was the control site. Participants were patients with moderate to severe dementia, aged 65 and above and with behavioural problems. When the study began, there were 594 participants from 28 care homes in Hamburg and 573 participants from 11 care homes in the control site. One hundred and thirty-one new admissions were recruited in the intervention site over a period of one year, and for the control group, 222 new recruits. Information about the measures used were limited. The authors discussed the outcomes in the following areas: the involvement of volunteers, social contacts between the residents and staff and families, expressed positive feelings of the residents, use of physical restraints, whether psychiatric treatment was required, and drug use. The participants were followed up for approximately six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nobili-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nobili 2006</LINK> was a prospective observational study to compare the characteristics and clinical outcomes of a sample of patients with dementia admitted to either SCUs or nursing homes without SCU randomly selected from an accredited list of these facilities in the Lombardy Region of Italy. The 10 most recently admitted residents with dementia were recruited and followed up at a six-month interval for 28 months. Socio-demographic, clinical, cognitive, functional, and behavioural data, and information on medications used were collected. The outcome measures included mortality, hospitalization at six months, use of physical restraints, falls, and exposure to antipsychotic drugs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>: The authors reported the demographic variables of the sample as a whole rather than differentiating them into SCU and traditional unit groups. It is not therefore known whether the two groups had any systematic differences between them to begin with. In another report from the same study, <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1994</LINK> noted that the SCU subjects were more cognitively impaired at baseline although the two groups did not differ in their functional abilities pre-test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Webber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Webber 1995</LINK>: Reportedly, Webber's sample was similar to the profile of institutionalized dementia patients in US (US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment <LINK REF="REF-US-OTA-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">US OTA 1990</LINK>). Although the demographic profile of the sample may be similar to that of the national profile, the differences between the SCU and non-SCU groups showed that they were not equivalent in a number of dimensions (refer to Risk of Bias Table).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>: On admission, the cases and controls had similar socio-demographic status, cognition, diagnoses, somatic health, and psychotropic drug use, but the SCU cases tended to have more severe behavioural disturbances and to be less restrained (19 versus 46%) over the first week after admission.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>: </P>
<P>More of the admissions to SCUs had disruptive behaviour and also of higher levels of disruption (44%) compared with non-SCU admissions (33%). </P>
<P>Among those with disruptive behavior, 37% of the disruptive admissions to SCUs presented extremely high levels of disruption compared to 30% for the non-SCU facilitates. There was no mention of whether these figures reached statistical significance. Those admitted to SCUs were more likely to be entering under private pay arrangements.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK>: The authors conducted a survey on all long-term care institutions in the province that cared for persons with dementia prior to the collection of outcome data. The facilities were stratified into SCUs and non-SCUs. The author's post-facto analysis revealed no significant differences between units included in the study and those excluded on the aspects of staff education, flexible care, use of restraints, or assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>: The residents consented to being moved to the new special care facilities and this induced a self-selection bias. A protocol governed inclusion of the residents into the three groups. The authors found no statistically significant differences between the groups in age, sex, GDS or age-adjusted co-morbidities. Also the pattern of psychotropic drug use did not vary between the three groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weyerer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weyerer 2005</LINK>: Selection bias is a major confound of this study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nobili-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nobili 2006</LINK>: A comparison of the baseline information revealed significant differences between the two groups, suggesting selection biases in the study design. These findings suggest that both the SCU and non-SCU groups were different to begin with.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>: The SCU was specially designed, with special staffing. Also, the staff were trained in geriatric or dementia care and the activities were specially programmed. The traditional units were units located within various location of the same facility.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Webber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Webber 1995</LINK>: An interesting observation was that the SCUs in this sample ranked lower than the comparison facilities on four measures of environmental quality as assessed by Webber and colleagues.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>: There was no particular information on how the SCUs were set up or different from traditional units.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>: There was no discussion on the set up of the SCUs or traditional units. The facilities were differentiated into SCUs, religious, and large facilities, adding a further dimension to the comparison which could also be a confounding factor.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK> defined the SCU as a unit that served primarily dementia residents, identified itself as a specialized unit for people with dementia, was separated from the rest of the facility by closed doors, and satisfied at least one of the following criteria: specially trained staff, special programme activities, or individual assessment and care planning.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>: This special care facility is rather different from other SCUs in general, compromising the validity of comparing the outcomes among studies. The authors also reported that almost all of the comparison groups (MTIFs and STIFs) had implemented some changes within the constraints of their institutional layouts and staffing to enhance the suitability of their physical and social environments for residents with dementia. Their resemblance to traditional nursing homes was again, therefore, hard to compare. The authors reported a short strike of personal care attendants in the STIF, which might have contributed to the dropouts at times 4 and 5 of the measurement points.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>: The authors reported an elaborate data collection process. Baseline data were collected on all dependent measures at time of assignment to the experimental and control groups, then every two months for the 12 months before the opening of the SCU, and for the 12-month period beginning with the fifth month after the SCU had opened. Data was not collected during the first four months after the opening of the SCU to control for relocation effects. Because staff were not blinded to participants' allocation, the researcher conducted inter-rater reliability testing between the staffs and used an independent rater for 10% of the residents in each data collection period. The inter-rater agreement between the staff who collected the data ranged from 85 to 97%. Concerning the validity and reliability of outcome measures, a number of new measures were developed by the authors: the Functional Abilities Checklist (FAC) and the Individual Incident Report (IIR), which had not yet been adequately tested for its validity and reliability.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Webber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Webber 1995</LINK> used more widely accepted outcome measures of improvement in patient behavioural, cognitive and physical functioning identified through an extensive literature review. The participants were assessed as soon as possible after admission. Post-testing was completed at a maximum six-month interval following baseline data collection. Staff informants were interviewed at the time of baseline resident data collection in the facility. A number of in-house instruments were developed and pre-tested to measure areas such as: baseline demographic data, health history and comorbid conditions, level and type of activities provided in the facility, and use of physical and pharmacological restraint. Other measures used include the MMSE for Cognitive functioning, the GDS for staging the disease, the CMAI for behavior, the Feeling Tone instrument for mood because CMAI does not include an assessment of positive mood, and the MDS-ADL for daily physical functioning. Reportedly the authors tested these instruments extensively, but there was no information on the training of the research personnel who collected data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frisoni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frisoni 1998</LINK>: The subjects were assessed seven to 14 days after admission (as baseline) and three months afterwards. The MMSE and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR, <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1993</LINK>) scale were used for the assessment of cognitive status. Functional status was assessed using the Bedford Alzheimer's Nursing Severity Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Volicer-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volicer 1994b</LINK>), the Barthel Index (BI), and the Tinetti Balance and Gait Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Tinetti-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinetti 1986</LINK>). Behavioural disturbances were assessed using the NPI, the CMAI, and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Alexopoulos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexopoulos 1988</LINK>). The CIRS was used to evaluate the presence of concurrent diseases. Data on drug use, the occurrence of falls and restraint use were also documented.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>: Data was collected at baseline and six-month follow-up. The outcome measures included Disruptive Behaviour - a 10-point scale using six disruptive behaviour items from the Minimal Data Set (MDS), which included: wandering verbal and physical abuse, disruptive behaviour, and resistance to take medications, or receive help for his activities of daily living (ADL). Other measures included the MDS-Cognition Scale (MDS-COGS) and MDS-ADL Self-Performance Index, psychotropic medication use and patterns of physical restraints use. Only the statistical management of data was discussed, and the data collection methods were not. It is not known who collected the data or how was it collected.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK>: The 14-item CMAI (short-form) was used to assess agitation. Mood was measured with the affect scale of the Feeling Tone Questionnaire (FTQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Toner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toner 1991</LINK>) but reliability statistics on the FTQ were not available at the time of the study and thus were not reported in the paper. The Multi-focus Assessment Scale-Revised, originally developed by <LINK REF="REF-Crockett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 1991</LINK>, was a tool to assess cognitive and behavioural functioning and has seven sub-scales. Social behaviour skills (0-11 point scale) and expressive language skills (3-15 point scale) were the sub-scales considered as part of the QOL measures because they could potentially be affected by quality of care. Change scores (t1 minus t2) were calculated to produce each outcome score rendering comparison of the results easier.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>: The measures used include the BCRS, Functional Assessment Staging, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Pleasant Event Scale-AD, the MOSES, and the Apparent Affect Rating Scale. Measurements were taken at baseline, three, six, nine, and 12 months and were not blinded. Some assessments were done presumably "objectively" - by a trained rater with direct observation of resident behaviours. Other assessments asked staff or families about behaviours in the previous week, therefore there could be the biases of not knowing the whole picture and problems with memory ratings. This was the only study that clearly indicated their use of intention-to-treat strategy. The authors pointed out that the interactive (BCRS) and observational (AARS) measures were limited by whether it was a 'good day' and the varying circumstances under which the five-min observation occurred.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weyerer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weyerer 2005</LINK> The authors had qualified nursing staffs to collect data in order to obtain "the most complete picture possible" (Abstract, p.85) Information about the details of outcome measures used, and their validity and reliability, was unavailable.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Nobili-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nobili 2006</LINK>: An individual, usually a ward doctor, was in charge of data collection and liaison with the two coordinators of the study. In maintaining data quality, training was carried out for all those involved at the various centres prior to the study. Moreover, during the two years of study, the two study coordinators visited each centre every six months for quality assurance purposes. Data was checked for errors, coherence, and missing information. Socio-demographic, cognitive, functional, behavioural, clinical status, and medications used were collected. The instruments used for clinical evaluation were the MMSE, the Severe MMSE (SMMSE), the BI, the NPI, and the CIRS. These are commonly used instruments and have been extensively tested for their psychometric properties.</P>
<P>It is somewhat surprising to the review team to see that after two decades of SCU research and development, this area of study is still limited in terms of evidence to inform research and practice. Given the proliferation of SCUs in many advanced countries in Europe and America, we need documentation of unequivocal outcomes to point the way ahead. While reported studies in the 1980s and 1990s had a number of methodological problems, more recent ones have been better designed and described clearer study protocols.</P>

<P>In some Cochrane meta-analyses, the reviewers assume a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and subsequent assessment points when changes from baseline scores are not reported. This, however, can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, Frisoni's SCU group had a baseline CMAI score of 40.7 (SD 24.6) and a three months CMAI score of 36.4 (SD 17.8). The overall change (not mean change) from the baseline to three months would be -4.3 (pooled SD not reported). Frisoni's non-SCU group had a baseline CMAI of 31.2 (SD 14.3) and a three months CMAI of 26.7 (SD 11.8). The overall change from baseline to three months would be -4.5 (pooled SD not reported). The difference between the overall change scores of the SCU and non-SCU groups at three months was only 0.2. When a zero correlation is assumed in comparing the CMAI scores at three months, the difference between the SCU and non-SCU groups becomes 9.7, greatly inflating the between-group differences. Such a strategy is therefore not adopted in this review. A randomly assigned sample does not guarantee equivalence between the experimental and the control groups. It only assures that if the groups are not equivalent, the differences are likely due to random errors.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-11 22:41:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of studies that can be pooled for analysis is limited. Nobili's findings, which at first sight, seemed to favour SCU care, need to be interpreted with caution. As the authors highlighted, the two groups were significantly different from each other at baseline along a number of dimensions. Those admitted to the SCUs were considerably younger, better educated, more cognitively and functionally able, and had a lower comorbidity index. The SCU group was behaviourally more disturbed at baseline. Because the two groups were different, the comparison between the groups as to whether SCU benefited them became doubtful. Another factor that might have affected the results was related to residents' time of admission. Although the study protocol was to recruit only newly admitted participants, residents recruited in the non-SCUs had stayed in the unit for 26.5 months (versus 13.6 months in SCUs, P = 0.0001). Nobili pointed out that such a wide variation in the time-since-admission to a nursing home could have influenced the baseline assessments. </P>
<P>It needs to be mentioned that Nobili only included completed cases in his statistical calculations at each time point. Sensitivity analysis was not performed and because only the outcomes of completed cases were analysed, a skewed estimation in favour of SCUs could have been induced.</P>
<P>Frisoni's study observed the outcomes of SCU and non-SCU participants over a period of three months. Their SCU participants were found to be significantly less depressed. This outcome, however, needs to be considered in terms of a person's reactions to relocation in the first few months after placement. In Webber's 1995 study, both SCU and non-SCU participants had an improvement in mood after an initial period of adjustment. Moreover, Frisoni's sample was small (SCU n = 31, non-SCU n = 35). Although Frisoni tried to match the characteristics of the two groups, the baseline scores of a number of outcome measures had a fairly large between-group difference, e.g., the NPI and CMAI had a difference of 10 and 9.2 points respectively. In addition, a three months pre- and post-intervention time point has been considered as too short a period to observe for meaningful outcome changes. <LINK REF="REF-Porell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porell 1998</LINK> argued that even six months was probably too short for evaluation of the impact of long-term care.</P>
<P>Last, there were positive results shown in favour of SCU care in the use of physical restraints. Yet, the evidence from only two non-RCTs cannot be considered as definitive.</P>
<P>SCUs were developed based on the assumption that a supportive specialized environment would improve the QOL and mitigate the challenging behaviours of people with dementia. Yet SCU are highly heterogeneous in terms of their philosophy, set up, staffing and programming. Although our review protocol specifies the components of a SCU to be considered for inclusion, in reality, details about the SCU in each published report were not always forthcoming. If these reports were excluded, then probably even less eligible studies would be available for review. Also, the comparison of SCUs as an intervention across diverse settings located in different countries does not make the results very convincing.</P>
<P>In the following, the four other studies that had acceptable methodological quality but no data available for a pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>) are briefly discussed as supplementary information. Because <LINK REF="STD-Weyerer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weyerer 2005</LINK> had no data at 6 months in the published report to support their findings, their conclusions are not included.</P>
<P>Chappell's 2000 study was conducted between 1996 and 1998. The sample (N = 510) was drawn from long-term care institutions throughout the province of British Columbia in Canada, a fairly extensive sample. Their study reported clear guidelines in data collection and management. Because the aim of Chappell was to examine whether dimensions clustered by facility type (SCU or non-SCU), their analysis did not differentiate between the outcome scores of SCU and non-SCU cases over the course of 12 months. What Chappell found was that there was no clustering of dimensions of care along SCU or non-SCU lines. Neither SCU status nor any single dimension being examined was highly predictive of outcomes. Rather, the residents' affect at baseline emerged as a characteristic that was significantly correlated with other outcomes. Unlike Nobili's study, their SCU and non-SCU groups had no significant differences in terms of cognitive, affect, or agitation at baseline.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1999</LINK>: The sample (N = 596) was drawn from a nationally representative group of 106 SCUs and 47 non-specialized comparison facilities in the US. Participants' outcomes were observed over a period of six months. Data was collected from December 1992 to June 1994. Their results indicated that when differences in age and baseline levels of disruptive behaviour were controlled, SCU placement showed no positive or negative effect on the frequency of aggressive behaviour. In Leon's study, it was the increased use of psychotropic medications and the reduction in the use of physical restraints that showed a relationship with lower levels of physically aggressive behaviour. In this review, the control group used slightly less psychotropic medications but more of them were restrained at six months. </P>
<P>Leon 1999 cautioned us not to jump to the conclusion that SCUs were not worthwhile components of SCU care. He stated that while not absolutely reducing the level of physical aggression, SCU placement did not lead to increased combative behaviour which would be expected if the resident was not under skilful care. This assumption, again needs to be tested.</P>
<P>The participants in Reimer's (2004) study (N = 185) came from a smaller convenience sample of 24 long-term care centres and four designated assisted living environments in an urban centre in western Canada. The focus of Reimer's study was to compare the effects of SCUs and traditional institutional facilities on QOL measures over a one-year period. No differences between groups in concentration, memory, orientation, depression, or social withdrawal were found. However, the authors reported that the SCU group demonstrated less decline in ADL, more sustained interest in the environment, and less negative affect than residents in the traditional institutional facilities. Reimer considered that a purpose-built special care facility could enhance QOL over time for adults with middle- to late-stage dementia. It needs to be pointed out that in Reimer's study, the intervention group resided in a purpose-built special care facility, which was rather different from other SCUs in general, compromising the validity of the comparison between the two types of care.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK> reported that there was a greater reduction in catastrophic reactions among the SCU participants. Their study sample is small (N = 22), and again, the authors reported that the SCU group was more agitated and behaviorally disruptive to begin with. Their claim therefore was not convincing.</P>
<P>The practical challenge of randomizing patients, the non-equivalence of groups at baseline, the heterogeneity of SCUs in the controlled trials being reviewed, the diversity in context (studies were conducted in different countries) and the limited studies available do not permit a definitive reply as to which of the two settings is more suitable for the treatment and care of a person with dementia.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-10 10:53:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of SCU care for people with dementia lacks substantial evidence. <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 2000</LINK> found that many non-SCUs were implementing a similar quality of care to that found within SCUs. One of the possible reasons was the "spilled over" effect from SCU to traditional home care when certain innovations became popular, or it could have been that many SCUs were simply implementing best practice dimension of care (Chappell 2000). As early as 1992, a report completed by the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-US-OTA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">US OTA 1992</LINK>) reported that it was difficult to find measurable differences in staff, resident or family caregivers outcomes between SCU and integrated (standard) nursing facilities. This does not seem to deter the rapid expansion of SCUs in both the public and private sectors (<LINK REF="REF-Porell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porell 1998</LINK>). In a statewide survey of long-term care facilities in Arkansas, <LINK REF="REF-Gerdner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdner 2001</LINK> observed that those facilities with SCUs offered virtually the same services as those without SCUs. To protect the consumer, consistency is needed in what a consumer can expect when a facility advertises having a SCU (<LINK REF="REF-Gerdner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1998</LINK> raised an interesting question about the value of SCUs - If a somewhat more expensive programme was only capable of increasing positive time use and counteracting detriment in positive affect, but unable to diminish negative behaviours, would the investment be justified? The result of this review is unable to answer this question. There was no evidence showing that the SCU group had a better quality of life in terms of more social interactions with others. Consequently, other issues follow - </P>
<P>if no measurable benefits for SCU care can be found, then we need to consider whether it is appropriate to place persons with dementia in a designated unit, with the likely unavoidable stigma of being a difficult group than the rest of the population in a NH.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ohta-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohta 1988</LINK> discussed who were the primary beneficiaries in SCU care, noting that special care can be beneficial to those who are not demented but need to reside in long-term care. Reportedly, cognitively intact people were distressed when they shared the same living space with those who were demented. This aspect, however, is beyond the focus of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2000</LINK> reported in their survey that the feelings of personal space, personhood, and an unforced routine were the significant elements in SCU care as perceived by families and staff. Some may suggest that the appraisal of SCU care by family and staff is just as important in evaluating SCU outcomes. If it is found that family and staff had benefited, then SCU care may still be worthwhile. Yet, studies on family and staff perceptions of SCU care are even fewer than those that examined patient outcomes. The included non-RCTs in this review did not investigate this aspect.</P>
<P>Apparently, SCUs and traditional nursing units admit residents with different clinical and socio-demographic profiles. Different types of care facilities can therefore be viewed as integral parts of a continuum of care for residents in different stages of dementia. Instead of marketing SCU care as better care for people with certain diagnostic groups, it seems more suitable to promote SCU care as appropriate care for people with dementia who are relatively younger and functionally more able.</P>
<P>There is no simple conclusion in terms of recommending practice in SCU care. To come back to the review question, the assumption that the SCU can better manage behavioural problems lacks substantial grounds. It seems that it is more important to implement best practice than to provide a specialized care environment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research about SCU care and its impact on outcomes will require an examination of a wide spectrum of special units, a comprehensive assessment of the characteristics of each unit, and a decision as to what aspects of SCU care are related to outcomes. A study of rigour should have a clear taxonomy of unit characteristics, information about the types of dementing disorders of participants, and assessors who are blinded to group allocation. A nonequivalent control group design in which a control condition is present but participants are not randomly assigned may be unavoidable in SCU research.</P>
<P>Selection bias is a major confound for non-RCTs and therefore needs to be better controlled in future studies. Because random assignment may not be feasible in studies on SCU outcomes, the control of differences in the characteristics of individuals within different settings thus becomes crucial. </P>
<P>Certain factors will need to be better controlled in order to obtain quality data. For instance, some studies controlled for transitions - the time between admission into a nursing home and adjusting to nursing home life (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Reimer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reimer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1993</LINK>) - but others did not. </P>
<P>A balanced decision concerning the choice of instruments is crucial in order to collect trustworthy data. Albeit time-consuming and subject to rater bias, direct observational data does have value over secondary data collected through, for example, caregiver interviews. Given the variability in nursing home services and the self-report nature of the data collected, more observational studies are warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Magaziner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magaziner 1994</LINK>). Both the NPI and the CMAI are commonly used assessments of residents' agitation, but they use information solicited from caregiver interviews. The appropriateness of using sub-scales, individual items, or overall scores as outcome measures (e.g. NPI) still lacks consensus among researchers in the field, not to mention the scalability of these tools. All of these issues deserve our further attention. Targeting research for different stages of dementing illness and in different settings will also be useful. </P>
<P>There is a need for editors of scientific journals to demand a more consistent format of reporting in clinical trials. Many studies reviewed do not provide the key information needed for meta-analysis, e.g., pooled standard deviations. In addition, many of them do not report how missing data was managed and whether intention-to-treat and sensitivity analyses were performed. </P>
<P>In 1994, Leon already pointed out that it is important to recognize that the population of SCU is continually expanding and that their programmatic features are perpetually changing. Over time, the development of specialized dementia care has progressed into a multitude of settings; community care and group living are becoming more popular. Future research should be not only directed at larger and more generalizable samples, but also conducted in a variety of settings such as day care, group living and other community care models. Such a development will make study designs more complex and challenging. But it is not something that is avoidable.</P>
<P>The measurement of specific outcomes in SCUs should continue to be a goal of anyone interested in these facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Parker_x002d_Oliver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker-Oliver 2005</LINK>). The issue about potential benefits for both formal and informal caregivers should also be examined. If the assumption underlying care in these units is that it is superior for the populations they are designed for, if family members continue to pay additional fees for this care (<LINK REF="REF-Maas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1998</LINK>), and if society as a whole, and not just the operators and stake holders, invests more when providing SCU care, then policy makers and consumers need to ask for empirical data measuring the benefits of these units.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In another report from the same study, Swanson 1994 noted that the two groups did not differ in their functional abilities pre-test but the SCU subjects were more cognitively impaired before the SCU opened (baseline).</P>
<P>The Individual Incident Report (the major outcome measure) had not yet been adequately tested for its validity and reliability.</P>
<P>The traditional units were units located within various location of the same facility. Basically it is an intra-facility comparison. In this case, many institutional variables might have been comparable. But the sample was small and the majority were male subjects, rendering this study distinct from other studies in this review</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Out of the 12 facilities that agree to participate, eight were selected as the final sample. It was unclear why were those eight selected</P>
<P>Only 70% of the control group participants had a diagnosis of AD as compared to 100% of the SCU participants </P>
<P>There were twice as many residents who were on Medicaid in the control facilities than in SCUs. That is, SCUs took on patients who were private paid. The two groups were likely to be different in terms of socio-economic status</P>
<P>Also SCUs were noted to admit patients with more problem behaviors than in traditional nursing units. Therefore the intervention and control groups were not equivalent to begin with</P>
<P>There was no information about the training of research personnel who collected data</P>

<P>Residents who were already living at the care homes and those who were newly admitted over a one-year period were recruited. </P>
<P>The control sites in Mannheim (a city in Germany) delivered traditional integrative care but the SCU sites in Hamburg delivered both segregative and integrative care, it is unclear how the datasets were compared, but the results might have been compromised</P>
<P>No discussion about how did the authors control for the different levels of behavioural problems in the participants</P>
