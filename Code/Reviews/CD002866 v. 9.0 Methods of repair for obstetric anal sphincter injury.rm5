<P>Ways of repairing damage to the muscles of the back passage following tearing during a difficult vaginal birth.</P>
<P>The risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries include a midline cut of the perineum (episiotomy) to facilitate the birth, forceps delivery and the baby&#8217;s back presenting posteriorly (occipito-posterior position). Most women give birth without any significant damage to their perineum or back passage. However, in about 1% to 4% of births, there is tearing and damage which extends to the back passage and the anal sphincter. This can cause considerable problems for some of these women in terms of pain, painful intercourse and faecal incontinence. For a few of these women, the incontinence can be very embarrassing and can impact significantly on their daily lives and relationships. This review of randomised controlled trials compared two different stitching techniques, one where the edges of the tissues were overlapped and the other where they were sewn end-to-end. There were 588 women in the six trials analysed. The trials were of moderate quality and differed in the participants, the outcome measures used and the points in time when they were measured. Only three trials with 156 women had 12-month follow-up data, when the overlap technique carried out as soon after childbirth as possible appeared to be better in terms of having faecal urgency and incontinence. Further research is needed to address women's views and experiences of surgery to prevent long-term problems.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-17 13:52:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anal sphincter injury during childbirth - obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) - are associated with significant maternal morbidity including perineal pain, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) and anal incontinence, which can lead to psychological and physical sequelae. Many women do not seek medical attention because of embarrassment. The two recognised methods for the repair of damaged external anal sphincter (EAS) are end-to-end (approximation) repair and overlap repair.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-02 12:17:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Six eligible trials, of variable quality, involving 588 women, were included. There was considerable heterogeneity in the outcome measures, time points and reported results. Meta-analyses showed that there was no statistically significant difference in perineal pain (risk ratio (RR) 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 1.45, one trial, 52 women), dyspareunia (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24, two trials, 151 women), flatus incontinence (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.23, three trials, 256 women) between the two repair techniques at 12 months. However, it showed a statistically significant lower incidence of faecal urgency (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.86, one trial, 52 women), and lower anal incontinence score (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.70, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.14, one trial, 52 women) in the overlap group. The overlap technique was also associated with a statistically significant lower risk of deterioration of anal incontinence symptoms over 12 months (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.79, one trial, 41 women). There was no significant difference in quality of life. At 36 months follow-up, there was no difference in flatus incontinence (average RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.99, one trial, 68 women) or faecal incontinence (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.98, one trial, 68 women).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-17 13:52:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data available show that at one-year follow-up, immediate primary overlap repair of the external anal sphincter compared with immediate primary end-to-end repair appears to be associated with lower risks of developing faecal urgency and anal incontinence symptoms. At the end of 36 months there appears to be no difference in flatus or faecal incontinence between the two techniques. However, since this evidence is based on only two small trials, more research evidence is needed in order to confirm or refute these findings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-28 13:07:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously during vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994a</LINK>)<I>.</I> However, a cut (episiotomy) may be made to facilitate the birth. Until recently there has been inconsistency in the classification of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2002</LINK>). This caused confusion among the clinicians in identification and management resulting in systematic under-reporting and misclassification (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1995</LINK>). A survey amongst consultant obstetricians in the UK in 2000 revealed that 46% were still classifying a complete or partial injury to the external anal sphincter (EAS) as a second-degree tear (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2000</LINK>). The current classification of perineal trauma was modified by Sultan in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1999b</LINK>) and has been adopted by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2007</LINK>) and the International Consultation on Incontinence since 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Koelbl-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koelbl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2002</LINK>).<BR/>

<LI>First-degree: injury to the skin only.</LI>
<LI>Second-degree: injury to the perineum involving perineal muscles but not involving the anal sphincter.</LI>
<LI>Third-degree: injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex: 3a: less than 50% of EAS thickness torn; 3b: more than 50% of EAS thickness torn; 3c: internal anal sphincter (IAS) also<I> </I>torn.</LI>
<LI>Fourth-degree: injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (EAS and IAS) and ano-rectal epithelium.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) include only third- or fourth-degree perineal tears and may cause considerable morbidity when compared to first- or second-degree perineal tears. Over the last five years, there has been an increase in litigation related to anal sphincter injury during childbirth and subsequent complications including faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the most distressing immediate complications of any perineal injury is perineal pain which may interfere with the mother's abilities to breast feed and cope with the daily tasks of motherhood (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>). Short-term perineal pain is associated with reactionary oedema, bruising, tight sutures, infection and wound breakdown. Persistent pain and discomfort from perineal trauma may also cause urinary retention and defecation problems. Several studies reported that following OASIS, perineal pain and dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) may last for several years and up to 50% of women complained of perineal pain and dyspareunia following OASIS (<LINK REF="REF-Haadem-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haadem 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haadem-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haadem 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994b</LINK>). Long-term perineal pain and dyspareunia can have considerable impact on sexual and social well being (<LINK REF="REF-Giebel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giebel 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wheeless-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeless 1998</LINK> reported that some women with dyspareunia following OASIS abstained from sexual intercourse for up to 14 years. <LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 1988</LINK> reported a significant permanent disfigurement of the perineum following OASIS.</P>
<P>Abscess formation, wound breakdown and recto-vaginal fistulae (abnormal communication between rectum and vagina) have been reported following OASIS (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pezim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezim 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothenberger-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothenberger 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Venkatesh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesh 1989</LINK> reported a 10% perineal wound disruption rate following primary repair of OASIS. The reported incidence of recto-vaginal fistulae in women who sustained a fourth-degree perineal tear ranges from 0.4% to 3.0% (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Giebel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giebel 1993</LINK> reported that most recto-vaginal fistulae were caused by failure to recognise the true extent of OASIS at the time of repair resulting in inadequate sphincter reconstruction and subsequent wound breakdown. Recto-vaginal fistulae are difficult to treat and may ultimately result in a permanent colostomy (<LINK REF="REF-Giebel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giebel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pezim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezim 1987</LINK>).<U>
<BR/>
</U>
<BR/>In addition to perineal pain, dyspareunia, wound breakdown and recto-vaginal fistulae formation, OASIS has been reported as the most common cause of anal incontinence following childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1997</LINK>). Anal incontinence is defined by the International Continence Society as involuntary loss of flatus or faeces, which becomes a social or hygienic problem (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2009</LINK>). It is estimated that anal incontinence affects one in 20 women up to one year after childbirth, affecting nearly 40,000 mothers each year in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 1991</LINK>). One-third of these are considered to be due to clinically undiagnosed (occult) OASIS (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1993</LINK>). The reported incidence of anal incontinence following primary repair of recognised anal sphincter injury is between 15% and 61% (<LINK REF="REF-Koelbl-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koelbl 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anal incontinence affects women psychologically as well as physically. Many of them do not seek medical attention because of embarrassment engendered by these taboo symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gjessing-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gjessing 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haadem-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haadem 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998</LINK> reported that the majority of women who sustained OASIS were either unaware of the diagnosis or were given a poor explanation for the injury. Indeed, some women were discouraged from discussing this because they felt that the anal incontinence symptoms were a normal consequence of childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Haadem-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haadem 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1996</LINK>). In one study, only one-third of women with faecal incontinence had ever discussed the problem with a physician (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1996</LINK>). One woman, in a letter to the Continence Foundation, described the eternal shame of being with another person when the worst occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Continence-Foundation-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Continence Foundation 2000</LINK>). The impact of this complication on the vulnerable postnatal woman and her baby is potentially catastrophic, affecting her physically and psychosocially. Furthermore, anal incontinence caused by OASIS has been reported to be associated with very high cumulative costs for the health services (<LINK REF="REF-Mellgren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellgren 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Increased awareness of these complications following vaginal birth has led women to request elective caesarean section without any other medical indication. A survey of female obstetricians reported that 31% would choose an elective caesarean section even in an uncomplicated pregnancy. The reason given by the majority was the potential risk of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Mufti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Mufti 1996</LINK>). However, caesarean delivery is associated with an increased risk of maternal morbidity compared with vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reported incidence of clinically detectable OASIS in the world literature is in the range of 0.5% to 7% with medio-lateral episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Nordenstam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordenstam 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tetzschner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetzschner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uustal-Fornell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uustal Fornell 1996</LINK>), but there are some reports with an incidence as high as 17% with midline episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Fenner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenner 2003</LINK>). In England the rate of reported third- or fourth-degree perineal tears has tripled from 1.8 to 5.9% between 2000 to 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Gurol_x002d_Urganci-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurol-Urganci 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk factors for OASIS include midline episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Fenner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenner 2003</LINK>), forceps delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994b</LINK>) and occipito-posterior position (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2001</LINK>) at delivery and birthweight more than 4 kg (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994b</LINK>). Similar to first- and second-degree tears OASIS is less likely to occur <I>de novo</I> in subsequent pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Poen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two recognised methods for the repair of damaged EAS, end-to-end (approximation) and overlap repair. In the end-to-end method, the torn ends of the EAS are approximated and sutured. In the overlap method, the torn ends of the EAS are brought together and sutured by overlapping one end of the muscle over the other in a double-breasted fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1999a</LINK>). An overlap repair is only possible when the full length and thickness of the EAS is disrupted and 1 to 1.5 cm of the muscle ends are overlapped (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2007</LINK>). Therefore no attempt should be made to overlap Grade 3a tears and partial thickness Grade 3b tears as these should be repaired by the end-to-end technique. In 2000 about half of the consultants in the UK used the end-to-end method and the other half used the overlap method (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2000</LINK>). Repair of OASIS is carried out as soon as possible after childbirth and is defined as a 'primary' repair. This is in contrast to 'secondary' repair which is carried out several months or years after the initial injury which may not be related to childbirth. In the UK, secondary sphincter repair for anal incontinence is usually performed  by colorectal surgeons, although this repair can also be performed by gynaecologists with specific training.</P>
<P>The degree of anal incontinence can be measured by incontinence scoring systems (<LINK REF="REF-Jorge-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorge 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaizey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaizey 1999</LINK>) or by quality of life assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>). These methods involve using validated questionnaires inquiring about different aspects of incontinence and how this affects the individual's day-to-day life. The St Mark&#8217;s score (<LINK REF="REF-Vaizey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaizey 1999</LINK>) ranges from zero to 24, with zero indicating complete continence and 24 indicating complete incontinence.</P>
<P>The anatomy of the anal sphincter can be assessed by anal endosonography. With this method, the extent of damage of the external and internal anal sphincter can be clearly seen. Function can be assessed by anorectal manometry which measures anal length and the pressure in the anal canal at rest and during voluntary squeeze.</P>
<P>There are several important questions related to the management of OASIS. These include the method of repair, suture materials used for the repair, the ideal clinician to perform the repair (obstetrician or colorectal surgeon), effectiveness of immediate versus delayed repair, prevention of OASIS and mode of delivery in subsequent pregnancies. The authors regard each of these questions as being important for future review. However, the aim of the current review is to examine the available studies to determine whether there is any clear scientific evidence that repair technique has any effect on subsequent continence and quality of life. Use of prophylactic antibiotics has been addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Buppasiri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buppasiri 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>We planned to carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we would not combine trials.</P>

<P>There were no quasi- or cluster-randomised trials identified. In future updates, if identified, we would consider these study designs.</P>
<P>There were considerable variations in outcome measures amongst the six included studies. The main outcome measures of the <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK> study were symptoms of faecal incontinence, abnormal findings relating to anal manometry investigations and abnormal findings on endoanal ultrasonography at three months postpartum. The primary outcome measure of <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> was symptoms of faecal incontinence at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included faecal urgency, perineal pain, dyspareunia and quality of life at three, six and 12 months; faecal incontinence at six weeks, three and six months, anal manometry, endoanal scan findings and improvement of anal incontinence symptoms at 12 months. Main outcome measures of the <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK> study were suture-related morbidity at six weeks, bowel symptoms at three, six and 12 months assessed by a validated questionnaire, anorectal physiology at three months and quality of life scores assessed by a validated questionnaire at three and 12 months. The primary outcome of the <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> study was leakage of solid stools once a week or more at 12 months. The secondary outcome measures of this study were leakage of liquid stools once a week or more, flatus incontinence once a week or more, dyspareunia once a month or more, mean Wexner score, continence status based on Wexner score, anal manometry and anal sphincter defects detected by endoanal ultrasonography at 12 months. The primary outcome of <LINK REF="STD-Farrell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farrell 2012</LINK> was flatal incontinence at six months whereas there secondary outcome measures were faecal incontinence, quality of life scales based on <LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>, anal manometry and anal sphincter defects detected by endoanal ultrasound scan at six months. The primary outcome measure of <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2005</LINK> was not clear and the study reported anal incontinence symptoms, flatus incontinence and faecal incontinence based on faecal incontinence score (<LINK REF="REF-Sangalli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sangalli 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>All six studies compared primary end-to-end and overlap repair techniques of external anal sphincter (EAS) performed immediately after obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK> carried out a three-month follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-Farrell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farrell 2012</LINK> followed up for six, 12, 24 and 36 months whereas <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK> performed a 12-month follow-up.

<P>It was somewhat difficult to compare the degree of perineal pain in three included studies because of different definitions and different time intervals. <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK> sub-divided perineal pain into perineal discomfort and need for perineal injection with local anaesthetic at three months. <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> reported rates of perineal pain at six weeks, three, six and 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK> reported perineal pain and dyspareunia together at six weeks, three, six, and 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Farrell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farrell 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> did not report perineal pain as an outcome measure in their studies.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of perineal pain at six weeks (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.26, one trial, 63 women), three months (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34, two trials, 172 women), six months (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.10, one trial, 56 women) and 12 months (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.45, one trial, 52 women) showed no statistically significant difference between overlap and end-to-end techniques, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>. There was also no statistically significant difference in the need for perineal injection with a local anaesthetic between the two repair techniques (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.91, one trial, 112 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life assessment</HEADING>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> reported quality of life assessment following the two repair techniques from six weeks to 12 months based on the scales described by Rockwood (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>). There are four sub scales, addressing lifestyle (effect of incontinence on day-to-day activity), coping and behaviour (effect of incontinence on ability to cope with the situation and resulting behaviour), depression and self-perception (effect of incontinence on feelings and self-confidence), and embarrassment (incontinence causing embarrassment). Each scale ranges from one to five, one indicating lower functional status of quality of life. Analysis of quality of life at 12 months based on four scales showed no statistically significant difference between overlap and end-to-end in mean lifestyle scale (mean difference (MD) 0.06, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.35, one trial, 52 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>, mean coping and behaviour scale (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.50, one trial, 52 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>, mean depression scale (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.26, one trial, 52 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>, and mean embarrassment scale (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.54, one trial, 52 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>.</P>

<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK>) reported modified Wexner anal incontinence scores based on <LINK REF="REF-Vaizey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaizey 1999</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> reported mean anal incontinence scores at six weeks, three, six and 12 months, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK> reported median anal incontinence scores at three months. <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> reported mean anal incontinence score at 12 months but the standard deviations were not reported. Hence anal incontinence scores from <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> were not included in the meta analysis.There was no statistically significant difference in the mean anal incontinence score at six weeks, three and six months between the two repair techniques. However, meta-analysis at 12 months showed a statistically significant lower anal incontinence score in the overlap group suggestive of better continence (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.70, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.14), <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>. This result was based on the <LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK> study where the confidence intervals were wide suggesting skewness of data, hence this finding should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>When analysing the overall number of participants with an anal incontinence score of more than 10 (that is, clinically significant anal incontinence) at 12 months, there was no difference in anal incontinence scores between the two groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.91, three trials 211 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>, (<LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-17 14:25:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are six included randomised controlled studies comparing immediate primary overlap and end-to-end techniques for OASIS. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the outcome measures, time points and reported results among these studies, which made it difficult to group them into similar outcome groups. Two studies have similar design and outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in perineal pain and dyspareunia, flatus incontinence and faecal incontinence between the two repair techniques at six weeks, three, six and 12 months after the repair. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK>), separately analysed faecal urgency symptoms and showed a statistically significant lower incidence in faecal urgency in the overlap group at 12 months. When addressing the outcome of faecal incontinence by mean anal incontinence scores and deterioration of anal incontinence symptoms at 12 months, the overlap group showed significantly lower relative risks compared to the end-to-end group.</P>
<P>The authors noted that the majority of weight in the meta-analysis was based on only one study where repairs were carried out by only two experienced clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Fernando-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernando 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Farrell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farrell 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rygh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rygh 2010</LINK> reported that the surgeons were trained in both techniques and were appropriately supervised. The effect of the surgeon's experience in the outcome of repair technique is not addressed in other included studies.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported the incidence of re-repair and women's view with regards to the type of repair and subsequent outcome.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-17 14:25:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data available show that, compared with immediate primary end-to-end repair of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS), immediate primary overlap repair appears to be associated with a reduced risk for faecal urgency, anal incontinence score and deterioration of anal incontinence symptoms at 12 months. At the end of 36 months there appears to be no difference in flatus or faecal incontinence between the two techniques. However, this evidence was based on only two small trials. The current findings indicate that the practitioner can perform either end-to-end or overlap repair of the external anal sphincter (EAS) at their clinical discretion.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-17 14:25:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review clearly shows the limited research relating to the repair of OASIS and the need for future pragmatic studies with larger numbers. It also highlights the difficulty in analysing data from different studies because of heterogeneity. We recommend that future studies, addressing the repair techniques of OASIS, follow up women with predefined time periods such as six weeks, three, six and 12 months with validated questionnaires with predefined outcome measures such as faecal urgency, faecal incontinence and anal incontinence scores. Outcome measures of future trials need to address quality of life issues that are important and meaningful to women, including the degree of disability caused by anal incontinence during day-to-day activities.</P>

<P>For 2006 version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2006</LINK>), we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (30 January 2006).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.</P>
<P>In addition, authors searched:<BR/>MEDLINE (January 1966 to 31 January 2006);<BR/>EMBASE (January 1974 to 31 January 2006);<BR/>SciSearch (January 1974 to 31 January 2006).</P>
<P>The search terms used were:<BR/>perin*, anal sphincter AND tear*, rupture*, trauma, damage, injur* AND labor, labour, birth, childbirth, delivery.<BR/>Also<BR/>obstetric* AND tear*, rupture*, injur*, damage, trauma</P>
