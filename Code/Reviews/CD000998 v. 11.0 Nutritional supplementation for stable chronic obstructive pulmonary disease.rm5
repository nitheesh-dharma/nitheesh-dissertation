Steiner data added at the end but needs further discussion with Ivone. Comparisons 1.8 and 1.9 are not yet sorted out October 9th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC final edits 4th October 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not usually include reports from single studies in the abstract. Could you check Schols 1995 for FFM/FFMI in comparison 1.8, as it is a very long way off the other results. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 12/04/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for submitting your review update Ivone. I haven't checked all the stats as I am waiting for you to answer the question about how you got the data for the lean body mass. Chris has also made some comments on this as we had some concerns about how the data was interpreted. We have made our comments below, but if anything is unclear, please do let me know. There are some notes in the text of the rview. It will probably be easiest if you rad through those and make your chenges then accept all the changes in the document (go to Edit &amp;gt; global replace &amp;gt; globally accept all changes) then you can look at the notes below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of bias &lt;/b&gt;- this section could do with some fleshing out. How are these potential risks of bias likely to over- or under-estimate the results of the review? I noticed in the characteristic of included studies table that in Ali 2007 there were 320 people randomised, but only 54 people completed the study. Why? This is an unbelievably high drop out rate and the selection process sounds very dodgy - I would discuss this in the review and mention that it did not contribute any data. or did you decide not to include any data from this trial in your review as it had a devastating risk of bias? I would make this study at high risk of bias for randomisation too and state that you excluded it from analysis and discussion because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antropometric data - weigh&lt;/b&gt;t. Why did you downgrade due to limitations in the study design? I think it's good that you are incorporating your GRADE judgments into the text, but it would be helpful for the reader to know why you made that decision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fat mass &lt;/b&gt;-&amp;quot; For the latter sub-group, the control group did much better.&amp;quot; I'm not sure that there is sufficient data to be able to say that so could you tone down this sentence please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked up percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy. I think this should be explained in the review and plain language summary as people might be interested in this as it is certainly a different intervention to eating!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the effect of some of the trials not being randomised or controlled? And which ones were they? this is quite serious and could merit a sensitivity analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please rearrange your discussion under the recommended headings which I have activated for you. There is too much repetition of the results in the first section of the discission. It is a similar length to the results and does not add much to what you already have - please reduce to a succinct paragraph or two highlighting key findings. For instance there is no need to repeat the statistics. It seems helpful to have a section on each of your hypotheses, so I wonder whether the focus could be on that rather than repeating the results section? I think you will need to be careful in making to much of the subgroup analyses given the limitations in the study quality and amount of data. You should to include the subgroup analyses in the results - or it might be best to draw up a table of the subgroup analyses - let me know if you need help in doing this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this seems to be a bit of a leap? &amp;quot;Although improved airflow obstruction was not an expected outcome from nutritional supplementation, recent epidemiological studies of dietary pattern have suggested that processed meat may be associated with an increased risk of COPD.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;rearranged forest plots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.6 - I think the labels are the wrong way round on the graph. COuld you confirm and change please&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;why do you want to include those figures? I can see why you want weight, but the other two seem quite random. I would delete them unless you have a good reason to keep them. if you need to keep them, link them in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC notes 13 April 2012 &lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;(Please see yellow highlighted text in the review)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please add differences between protocol and review (e.g. subgroup analyses that you have added for this update to try to define who gets most benefit)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say in the abstract that some patients gained 2.5 kg on treatment is a misinterpretation of the 95% CI (see below). Also you need very tight confidence intervals to say lean mass was not improved, I think you mean you found no significant difference in lean mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confidence interval does not show what happened to some patients, it reflects that we are uncertain about the mean difference due to the play of chance. The mean might include the possibility of a clinically significant difference in the average response, so we cannot be sure if the treatment works or not! We need the mean and 95% CI for all the results in the abstract please (with the number of patients and trials for each if possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by significant in the conclusions? Clinical, statistical other? The conclusions will need revision once the results in the abstract are clearer (as above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plain language summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not think this is what the results actually mean! Placebo might do all these things in some patients by chance!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issues about the confidence intervals above need to be addressed in the results of the review as well. I have not looked at the discussion, but this will also likely need to be amended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Edit of update Oct 31 2006&lt;br&gt;Toby to add the Weibe reference please&lt;br&gt;Abstract: QOL of life benefit is from a single study. Has been toned down in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;Results - changed random to fixed models in first paragraph.&lt;br&gt;Jadad scores over 2 not equal to 2 usually regarded as high quality? I will check the Moher reference on this.&lt;br&gt;Discussion - was the whole 95% CI below the minimal clinically important difference for FEV1 and 6 minute walk. Also significant needs adding to final para.&lt;br&gt;Changes left in Red.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;========================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing 17 Feb 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: no change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sub-group results on weights have been rephrased.

Is fat mass and fat free mass the same thing? If not should we enter Lean mass as the same as fat free mass? This could well affect the overall estimate for this outcome so I need your help here Ivone. This may men having to rethink the data for that outcome in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have estimated SDs for Steiner 2003 based upon the average SD:mean ratio for the other studies in the weight outcome. This does not seem to unduly affect the pooled effect estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goris 2003 had some FEV1 data - I have added this to the outcome on FEV1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have moved the studies excluded from the review to Excluded studies list. It might be better to keep studies where authors have not responded to requests for data to 'awaiting assessment' and be transparent that it is impossible to include these studies for usre (Vargas 1995 and Rogers 1992). Would you agree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRQOL - Steiner reported this as mean differences in CRQ with 95% CIs - I have entered these in the review as per protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the SMD conversion table (Table 02) - Can you check and agree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Nutritional supplementation for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease UPDATE&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Nutritional supplementation for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (UPDATE AWAITING COMMENT FROM IF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-11-06 10:13:18 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="NUT-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.7" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<P>This update has undergone substantial methodological changes and has added three primary studies and a publication of a previously included PhD thesis. Results for previously reported outcomes changed, there is now evidence of improvement in several outcomes including weight, anthropometric measures, walking distance, respiratory muscle strength, and new data for HRQoL using the SGRQ suggest that total SGRQ scores were both statistically and clinically significant, activity scores were statistically significant, but impact and symptoms were not statistically different.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:50:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Low body weight is common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can weaken their heart and lung function, and reduce their ability to exercise. Some degree of malnutrition is common in people with COPD but it is unclear whether this is the cause of their deterioration, or just part of the progress of the disease. This review of 17 studies (632 participants) that provided nutritional supplementation for patients with COPD for more than two weeks found growing evidence that nutritional supplementation improved body weight, respiratory muscle strength, walking and quality of life.</P>

<P>To assess the impact of nutritional support on anthropometric measures, pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscles strength, endurance, functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in COPD.</P>
<P>If benefit is demonstrated, to perform subgroup analysis to identify treatment regimens and subpopulations that demonstrate the greatest benefits.</P>

<P>We included 17 studies (632 participants) of at least two weeks of nutritional support. There was moderate-quality evidence (14 RCTs, 512 participants, nourished and undernourished) of no significant difference in final weight between those who received supplementation and those who did not (MD 0.69 kg; 95% CI -0.86 to 2.24). Pooled data from 11 RCTs (325 undernourished patients) found a statistically significant weight gain (MD 1.65 kg; 95% CI 0.14 to 3.16) in favour of supplementation; three RCTs (116 mixed population) found no significant difference between groups (MD -1.28 kg; 95% CI -6.27 to 3.72). However, when analysed as change from baseline, there was significant improvement with supplementation: 14 RCTs (five of which had imputed SE), MD 1.62 kg (95% CI 1.27 to 1.96 ); 11 RCTs (malnourished), MD 1.73 kg (95% CI 1.29 to 2.17) and three RCTs (mixed), MD 1.44 kg (95% CI 0.68 to 2.19).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence from five RCTs (six comparisons, 287 participants) supporting a significant improvement from baseline for fat-free mass/fat-free mass index (SMD 0.57; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09), which was larger for undernourished patients (three RCTs, 125 participants; SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47). There was no significant change from baseline noted for adequately nourished patients (one RCT, 71 participants; SMD 0.27; 95% CI -0.20 to 0.73), or for a mixed population (two RCTs, 91 participants; SMD -0.05; 95% CI -0.76 to 0.65).</P>
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence from two RCTs (91 mixed participants) that nutritional supplementation significantly improved fat mass/fat mass index from baseline (SMD 0.90; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.33).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (eight RCTs, 294 participants) of an increase in mid-arm muscle circumference change (MAMC; MD 0.29; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (six RCTs, 125 participants) of no significant difference in change from baseline scores for triceps measures (MD 0.54; 95% CI -0.16 to 1.24).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (five RCTs, 142 participants) of no significant difference between groups in the six-minute walk distance (MD 14.05 m; 95% CI -24.75 to 52.84), 12-minute walk distance or in shuttle walking. However, the pooled change from baseline for the six-minute walk distance was significant (MD 39.96 m; 95% CI 22.66 to 57.26).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (seven RCTs, 228 participants) that there was no significant difference between groups in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>; SMD -0.01; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.30) when measured in litres or percentage predicted.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (nine RCTs, 245 participants) of no significant between group difference in maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP; MD 3.54 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O; 95% CI -0.90 to 7.99), but those who received supplementation had a higher maximum expiratory pressure (MEP; MD 9.55 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O; 95% CI 2.43 to 16.68). For malnourished patients (seven RCTs, 189 participants), those with supplementation had significantly better MIP (MD 5.02; 95% CI 0.29 to 9.76) and MEP (MD 12.73; 95% CI 4.91 to 20.55).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence (four RCTs, 130 participants) of no significant difference in HRQoL total score (SMD -0.36; 95% CI -0.77 to 0.06) when pooling results from both the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).</P>
<P>Two trials (67 participants) used the SGRQ to measure individual domains of activity, impact and symptoms. At the end of treatment, the pooled total SGRQ score was both statistically and clinically significant (MD -6.55; 95% CI -11.7 to -1.41). The three RCTs (123 participants) that used the CRQ to measure the change in individual domains (dyspnoea, fatigue, emotion, mastery), found no significant difference between groups.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:50:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found moderate-quality evidence that nutritional supplementation promotes significant weight gain among patients with COPD, especially if malnourished. Nourished patients may not respond to the same degree to supplemental feeding. We also found a significant change from baseline in fat-free mass index/fat-free mass, fat mass/fat mass index, MAMC (as a measure of lean body mass), six-minute walk test and a significant improvement in skinfold thickness (as measure of fat mass, end score) for all patients. In addition, there were significant improvements in respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP) and overall HRQoL as measured by SGRQ in malnourished patients with COPD.</P>
<P>These results differ from previous reviews and should be considered in the management of malnourished patients with COPD.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-05 10:38:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-01 00:45:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some degree of malnutrition is common in about a third of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be severe in advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rochester-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochester 1992</LINK>). Depletion measured by fat-free mass can be present even if body weight is normal (<LINK REF="REF-Schols-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 1993b</LINK>). Although malnutrition is more common among patients with emphysema than those with chronic bronchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Openbrier-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Openbrier 1983</LINK>), it is unclear whether malnutrition is the cause of the deterioration or a marker of disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Angelillo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelillo 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have shown an association between malnutrition and impaired pulmonary status in patients with COPD. Low-weight COPD patients have greater gas trapping, lower diffusing capacity and lower exercise capacity than patients with the same degree of airflow obstruction but normal weight (<LINK REF="STD-Sahebjami-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sahebjami 1993</LINK>). Malnutrition is also associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (<LINK REF="REF-Goris-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goris 1997</LINK>) and a higher mortality rate (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>), independent of their ventilatory limitation. Several studies have shown greater mortality in underweight and normal weight patients with COPD compared with obese and overweight patients. Schols and colleagues demonstrated that fat-free mass is an independent factor of mortality, regardless of fat mass (<LINK REF="REF-Schols-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 2005</LINK>). The BODE index (body-mass index, airflow obstruction dyspnoea and exercise capacity; <LINK REF="REF-Celli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2004</LINK>) includes body mass index (BMI), reinforcing the importance of nutritional status as an important predictor in COPD. In addition, mid-thigh muscle mass, measured by computer tomography (CT) scan, has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality than weight (<LINK REF="REF-Marquis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquis 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous factors may contribute to the impairment in respiratory status in malnourished patients with COPD. Malnutrition impairs skeletal muscle function among healthy individuals and those with respiratory conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Arora-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arora 1982</LINK>). It can lead to a reduction in diaphragmatic mass with a decrease in strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Arora-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arora 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiaccadori-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiaccadori 1992</LINK>). Evidence in support of a relationship between metabolic changes and inflammatory mediators has been reported among patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Schols-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 1996</LINK>). We now understand COPD as a multi-component disease with known systemic effects such as weight loss, osteoporosis, muscle depletion, tissue depletion and peripheral muscle dysfunction. Several inflammatory markers are increased in patients with COPD, including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;; <LINK REF="REF-de-Godoy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Godoy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schols-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 1996</LINK>), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>If malnutrition is important in COPD, nutritional support might be an important component of their management. Some authors have reported benefits of nutritional support in COPD patients; for example, there is evidence that when ambulatory COPD patients receive nutritional repletion, the strength and endurance of their respiratory and limb muscles improves (<LINK REF="REF-Rochester-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochester 1992</LINK>). However, other studies could not demonstrate the same results (<LINK REF="REF-Donahoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donahoe 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, it remains unclear as to whether an improvement in respiratory and peripheral muscle function results in better functional exercise capacity or improvements in HRQoL.  Although several reviews on nutritional support in COPD have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Rochester-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochester 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donahoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donahoe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1996</LINK>), no meta-analysis or clinical practice guidelines were published prior to the original version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2000a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2001</LINK>).

<P>For post-treatment data, we used MD to pool data from studies that measured outcomes with the same measurement tool and SMD when the outcomes were similar but the measurement tools were different.

<P>For change from baseline scores, we calculated the MDs between the pre- and post-treatment values and SE whenever possible, using information given on change: SD, 95% confidence interval (95% CI), patient data, P values or graphical displays.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 10:38:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We used a broad definition of nutritional support (any caloric supplementation given for at least two weeks) to enable us to include as many trials as possible. In this update, 17 trials (632 participants) were included; four new RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>) were added and data were updated for one (<LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK>). Thirteen RCTs were performed in an outpatient setting, four had an inpatient component (<LINK REF="STD-Fuenzalida-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fuenzalida 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>); 15 used oral supplementation, mostly liquid pre-prepared supplement, one used nocturnal enteric tube feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>), and one used a tailored and fortified diet with milk products (<LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK>); 13 included only undernourished/depleted patients, four included both malnourished and nourished patients (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>) and in five trials, nutrition was combined with exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our original meta-analyses, we found only small estimates of effect when comparing end of treatment results and similar results when we compared change from baseline scores (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2000a</LINK>). In the present review, we used post-intervention values in our analyses for all outcomes, and pooled the change from baseline scores for primary outcomes, albeit with imputations of variance for five of the 14 studies. As the body of knowledge builds, we are able to see the effects of the intervention overall, and on the subgroups of undernourished and nourished populations.</P>
<P>Nutritional supplementation improved weight, fat mass and lean body mass, as measured by MAMC, fat-free mass/fat-free mass index, fat mass/fat mass index and functional exercise capacity in malnourished COPD patients. This change was more likely to be statistically significant when change from baseline rather than end of treatment scores were pooled, as the correlation between baseline and final score in individual patients was high and there was baseline imbalance in weight.</P>
<P>Weight was the most frequently reported outcome in the 17 included trials, 14 of which included data that could be pooled. Recent trials have suggested that a planned nutritional programme can reverse malnutrition in patients with COPD. When we pooled the end results of 14 trials including both undernourished and nourished participants (15 comparisons), there was moderate-quality evidence showing no statistically significant difference in final weight between those who received a supplement and those who did not. Some of the reports showed that on average, those in the control group lost weight (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>). When we analysed trials that included only undernourished patients, there was statistically significant difference in final weight in favour of supplementation, suggesting that malnourished patients do benefit from supplementation.</P>
<P>The high correlation between baseline and end of study (0.962) justified the need to look into change from baseline scores. Consequently, the change score had a smaller SD than the end of intervention results. The change score results are statistically more powerful and showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the intervention. This did not change when we excluded trials that included nourished patients or a mixed population. The fact that the end of intervention analysis is also significant for the depleted/undernourished group is reassuring.</P>
<P>Schols and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Schols-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 1998</LINK>) performed a retrospective evaluation of predictors of mortality in 400 patients and then prospectively validated the results. They found that low BMI, age and hypoxaemia were independent predictors of mortality in the retrospective trial. After stratification into BMI quintiles, a threshold of 25 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> was identified, below which mortality risk was increased. In the prospective group, weight gain greater than 2 kg over eight weeks in depleted and non-depleted patients with COPD, as well as an increase in inspiratory muscle strength, were significant predictors of survival. <LINK REF="REF-Schols-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 2005</LINK> suggested that cachexia should be defined in terms of lean body mass index (LBMI = lean body mass divided by height squared). Cachexia is present in males when the LBMI is less than 16 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> and in females when it is less than 15 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>Newly included trials provided data for lean body or fat-free mass or fat-free mass index, measured with different methods (bioelectrical impedance or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). When we pooled the mean changes from baseline from these trials (using SMD; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>), the results were significant overall (SMD 0.57; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09); pooled results from trials that only included undernourished patients were higher (SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47). When we look at MAMC as an indirect measure of lean mass, there was again a statistically significant difference in favour of supplementation.</P>
<P>When we pooled the end of trial measures of fat mass, there was a statistically significant difference in skinfold thickness, suggesting that some fat mass was increased. This was not confirmed when we pooled change from baseline scores for skinfold thickness, possibly because the same trials could not be included in both analyses, but was confirmed when pooling change from baseline scores for fat mass/fat mass index (SMD 0.90; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Alterations in weight can be due to changes in fat mass (<LINK REF="STD-Donahoe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Donahoe 1994</LINK>), but this may not be the case here, as an increase in MAMC suggests improvement in lean body mass.</P>
<P>Pooling the mean end measures did not show a significant difference for functional exercise capacity; however, when we pooled the change from baseline scores, there was a statistically significant difference of 40 m during the six-minute walk test. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID), defined as the smallest difference perceived as important by the average patient, is conservatively considered to be 54 m (<LINK REF="REF-Redelmeier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redelmeier 1997</LINK>), although some now claim that the MCID is 25 m (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2010</LINK>). Of the five trials used in change score the SE was imputed in two trials, and the other three trials included exercise as part of the pulmonary rehabilitation programme. We cannot exclude that exercise may have acted as a co-intervention.</P>
<P>There was a small, statistically significance difference in respiratory muscle strength, both inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in favour of nutritional supplementation, more so in undernourished patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>) that included a mixed population also used respiratory muscle training. Although the increment was small, for malnourished patients that clearly have decreased respiratory muscle strength (average of 57 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O) this may be of clinical significance.</P>
<P>Improved airflow obstruction was not an expected outcome from nutritional supplementation, and there was low-quality evidence that there was no statistically or clinically significant change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Redelmeier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redelmeier 1996</LINK>). Some epidemiological studies have suggested an association between a diet that includes processed meat and an increased risk of COPD and that a 'prudent pattern' (high consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish oil and whole grain cereals) may protect against impaired lung function and COPD, especially in male smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Shaheen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaheen 2010</LINK>). Keranis and colleagues reported on the association between foods rich in anti-oxidants and lung function in COPD that suggested a protective effect attributable to an anti-oxidant diet (<LINK REF="REF-Keranis-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keranis 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review now includes more data on HRQoL, but the trials used different measures (SGRQ, CRQ and SF-36) to report the results. Some trials reported the total scores, while others reported changes in different domains. The pooled results of total scores (SGRQ and CRQ) showed little or no difference between groups. This may have been influenced by the baseline imbalance in <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; the control group had higher baseline scores and although their HRQoL decreased and there was significant improvement in the treated group, the post-intervention scores of the control group remained higher.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence, at the end of treatment; the pooled total SGRQ score was both statistically and clinically significant. <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK> used the SGRQ to measure individual domains of activity, impact and symptoms. There was low-quality evidence that pooled data for activity was statistically and clinically significant and impact and symptoms were not. See <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>. There were no statistically significant pooled changes noted for any of the domains measured with the CRQ (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>). See <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK>), provided low-quality evidence of a significant improvement in health, measured by the SF-36 (MD 24.20; 95% CI 10.62 to 37.78), a general rather than a disease-specific measure of HRQoL.</P>
<P>The studies that included HRQoL suggest that nutritional supplementation may promote improvement in the quality of life of malnourished patients with COPD. As this is a very important outcome, more trials using these end points are needed. Although four of these trials included pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise, which may have influenced the outcomes, one study <LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK> did not include exercise, so the improvement cannot be attributed solely to exercise.</P>
<P>The mechanisms involved in cachexia are complex and include increased metabolism, diet-induced thermogenesis, tissue hypoxia, inactivity, oxidative stress, accelerated ageing, anabolic hormonal insufficiency, corticosteroids and systemic inflammation. Different factors may affect COPD phenotypes differently (<LINK REF="REF-King-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2008</LINK>). Systemic inflammation has been a primary focus of research in the genesis of cachexia and weight loss in COPD. Elevated levels of soluble TNF-&#945; receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Francia-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Francia 1994</LINK>), such as CRP, IL-6 and IL-8, have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garrod-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrod 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>). More mechanistic knowledge is still needed, and it is not possible to attribute cachexia in COPD unequivocally to inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">We had outlined a number of hypotheses before starting the original review, which we will discuss below.</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Do undernourished patients benefit more from supplementation than nourished patients?</HEADING>
<P>When we pooled the end of intervention results from the 11 RCTs (325 patients) that included only undernourished patients, there was a statistically significant MD of 1.65 kg (95% CI 0.14 to 3.16), whereas, the RCTs with nourished patients did not do as well (MD -1.70 kg; 95% CI -4.97 to 1.57), neither did RCTs with a combined nourished/undernourished population (MD -1.28 kg; 95% CI -6.27 to 3.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The same pattern was seen when we pooled the change from baseline scores (undernourished: MD 1.73 kg; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.17; nourished: MD 1.50 kg; 95% CI -0.08 to 3.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooled change from baseline results in fat-free mass and fat-free mass index also showed that undernourished patients improved much more (SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47) than adequately nourished patients (SMD 0.27; 95% CI -0.20 to 0.73) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Are the benefits of supplementation linked to the amount of supplementation?</HEADING>
<P>In this review, we noted that all included trials reported an increased caloric intake for the supplementation groups. Not all trials reported similar amounts; the current evidence neither supports nor refutes this hypothesis. The weighted average of calories at end of treatment for the intervention group was 2065.1 kcal and for the control group was 1918.1 kcal.</P>
<P>We can speculate that our inability to get an even bigger response to nutritional support reflects the multifactorial mechanisms of weight loss in COPD, whereby increased energy expenditure is not balanced by an adequate dietary intake (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>); in some cases, the intervention may have been started in a late stage of the disease, leaving the patient unable to respond positively (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2008</LINK>); in yet other cases, patients may be replacing their usual intake with the supplement (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2008</LINK>). However, there are insufficient data to support any of these hypotheses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Does the length of supplementation determine the extent of the improvement?</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials that included only malnourished patients provided supplementation for at least seven weeks and showed a mean weight change of 1.65 kg (95% CI 1.20 to 2.09); two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fuenzalida-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fuenzalida 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>) provided supplementation for less than seven weeks, and showed a mean change of 2.46 kg (95% CI 0.85 to 4.06). However, if <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK> is excluded, since they used enteral tube feeding, the mean change drops to 1.22 kg (95% CI -1.58 to 4.02). Seven weeks were chosen as a cut-off, since most rehabilitation programmes range from six to eight weeks. The data did not support this hypothesis; however, there may be other confounding factors that are not readily apparent.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK> showed significant positive effects of supplementation after four months (data used for the meta-analyses), which were maintained at 24 months. During the maintenance phase, nutritional supplementation was provided "when indicated" for depleted patients. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Does supervised supplementation result in better improvements in anthropometric measures and exercise capacity than unsupervised supplementation?</HEADING>
<P>Studies of nutritional support in which the observer is blinded and impartial to the group allocation present challenges in both design and execution. Controlling for nutritional support in the outpatient setting is especially difficult as only partial supervision is possible. If the supplements are associated with side effects such as bloating, fullness or dyspnoea, subjects are tempted to reduce either the supplement or their usual nutritional intake, leading to reduced caloric intake (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1988</LINK>). The four trials with malnourished patients that had an inpatient component (<LINK REF="STD-Fuenzalida-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fuenzalida 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>) showed a statistically significant mean change in weight gain of 2.46 kg (95% CI 1.57 to 3.35) while the seven trials that examined malnourished outpatients showed a statistically significant but smaller mean change in weight gain of 1.49 kg (95% CI 1.03 to 1.96). However, given today's economic realities, inpatient supplementation would only be carried out in rare circumstances.</P>
<P>The distance walked in six minutes was only measured in trials that examined outpatients, therefore we can offer no conclusions on these measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Is nutritional support combined with exercise training better than supplementation alone?</HEADING>
<P>Exercise training is regarded as an obvious adjunct therapy in chronic diseases of most types, especially if associated with weight loss. It is an important anabolic stimulant and a key intervention to improve exercise tolerance, peripheral muscle function and HRQoL in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). Cachectic patients with COPD retain the capacity for peripheral remodelling in response to rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Vogiatzis-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogiatzis 2010</LINK>). However, in COPD, findings suggest that markers of oxidative stress are increased by exercise that has the potential to further compromise them (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garrod-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrod 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2008</LINK>). When malnourished patients are involved in pulmonary rehabilitation, they may lose weight (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 1998</LINK>); as noted among the control group in some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>). Even if it does not significantly contribute to weight gain, adequate nutrition could be preventing further weight loss by counteracting the impact of increased inflammation.</P>
<P>The five trials (six comparisons) that included exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>) reported a statistically significant change in weight of 1.80 kg (95% CI 1.28 to 2.33). Nine trials did not include exercise and reported a smaller statistically significant change in weight of 1.48 kg (95% CI 1.03 to 1.93). The three trials that included exercise and just included malnourished patients (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>) demonstrated a higher weight gain of 2.31 kg (95% CI 1.09 to 3.36), while the difference in the results from trials that only included malnourished patients who did not have exercises was much less at 1.51 kg (95% CI 1.02 to 2.00).</P>
<P>Three trials, <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK> (low intensity) and <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>, had home-based exercise programmes, <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK> used an inpatient rehabilitation programme and <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>, an outpatient rehabilitation programme.</P>
<P>The change score results in weight suggest an additional anabolic effect of exercise and the importance of physical activity for patients with COPD.</P>
<P>Exercise did not make a statistically significant difference in maximal inspiratory strength for those who were malnourished, while for maximal expiratory muscle strength there was an increased MD of 20.08 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (95% CI 5.18 to 34.98) for two trials with exercise, versus MD of 9.94 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (95% CI 0.75 to 19.13) for the five trials without exercise. The clinical relevance of these changes remains to be established.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Are the results of the trials determined by their methodological quality (risk of bias)?</HEADING>
<P>The overall mean difference in final weight from 14 trials (15 comparisons) was 0.69 kg (95% CI -0.86 to 2.24). The mean difference from the six trials (seven comparisons) with a low risk in sequence allocation and concealment (selection bias) was 0.07 kg (95% CI -2.07 to 2.21), while the other eight trials with a higher risk of selection bias found a mean difference of 1.60 kg (95% CI -0.51 to 3.72). However, these differences in final weight are not supported by the results considered as change from baseline. When the differences in change from baseline weight are examined there is less difference: overall MD 1.62 kg (95% CI 1.27 to 1.96); low risk of selection bias MD 1.80 kg (95% CI 1.24 to 2.35); higher risk of selection bias MD 1.54 kg (95% CI 1.06 to 2.02). We would expect to see this, since the change from baseline scores may be less affected by selection bias than the change measured as final weight.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:57:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Interest regarding weight loss among those with COPD has resulted in several trials of nutritional support, administered orally or by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (a surgical technique for inserting a feeding tube directly into the stomach for those who cannot swallow; <LINK REF="STD-Donahoe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Donahoe 1994</LINK>). Unfortunately, some reported studies were not randomised or controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donahoe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Donahoe 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sridhar-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Sridhar 1994a</LINK>) and therefore they were excluded from this review.</P>
<P>There is growing evidence that patients with COPD and low body weight are associated with higher healthcare utilisation. A subgroup analysis in <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK> suggested that patients receiving nutritional support gained weight and were less frequently hospitalised. This was suggestive of cost savings. This was also previously suggested by Weekes (2004 unpublished data), and to a lesser extent by <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>.</P>

<P>Overall, the risks of bias in the primary studies suggests poor internal validity and the caveat that caution should be exerted when interpreting the results. Uncertain methods of randomisation, allocation concealment, and lack of blinding of research personnel and participants are known to result in an overestimation of the estimate of effect. This was supported by our sensitivity analysis of trials that measured final weight, but not by the findings of change from baseline weight. Coupled with small numbers of participants in the studies, care should be taken when generalising the results to a broader target population. None of the outcomes were supported by high-quality evidence; only a few by moderate and most were only supported by low-quality evidence, suggesting that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:57:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Inevitably a meta-analysis involves a retrospective analysis, subject to the limitations of any retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>). However, the primary scientific studies from which the data were collected were all prospectively conducted randomised and controlled. A small total number of participants was studied in the trials reviewed here. Meta-analysis of small studies may be subject to publication bias favouring a positive result. The fact that we found positive results in weight with two different statistical analyses is re-assuring. The meta-analyses would have had greater statistical power with a larger number of participants. With only 17 trials included, we tried to maximise the available data by contacting the authors of the primary studies; we were unable to include the data from three studies because of incomplete reporting of methods and data.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the above points, the meta-analyses did increase the statistical power of the primary end points, in comparison with any of the individual trials, thus narrowing the CIs around the estimates of the magnitude of the treatment effect. It also served to reduce uncertainty when reports disagreed (<LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1987</LINK>). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>). Results from many outcomes were supported by low-quality evidence, meaning that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Moderate-quality evidence was identified for weight gain, fat mass and fat-free mass; further research may have an important impact in our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-01 11:35:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This study differs from our original review as there is now emerging evidence that supplementation improves anthropometric measures, functional exercise capacity, respiratory muscle strength and quality of life, especially for the malnourished COPD patient. It also differs from earlier versions in methodology, in keeping with the updated standards in <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Collins and colleagues performed a similar review (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2012</LINK>). They included 13 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Efthimiou-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Efthimiou 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otte-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Otte 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuenzalida-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fuenzalida 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLetter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DeLetter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weekes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weekes 2009</LINK>), used different methodology and showed a statistically significant MD of 1.94 kg (SE 0.26; P &lt; 0.001) for 11 trials with depleted patients and a statistically significant MD of 1.319 kg (SE 0.368; P &lt; 0.000) for 13 trials that included both depleted and non-depleted patients.</P>
<P>We pooled both end of intervention and changes scores (GIV method) and used the new Cochrane criteria to assess risk of bias; the difference between our results and theirs may be because of the inclusion of data from different trials (we had no data from <LINK REF="STD-Goris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goris 2003</LINK>; Collins and colleagues did not include <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2008</LINK> also performed a similar review in stable COPD. The literature search was from 1966 to 2007; they included 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Efthimiou-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Efthimiou 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otte-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Otte 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuenzalida-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fuenzalida 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>), used Review Manager 4.2, and found no statistically significant difference in SMD for weight, MAMC, triceps skinfold thickness, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or forced vital capacity (FVC). They concluded that caloric supplementation had no effect on improving nutritional status or pulmonary function in patients with COPD, and that there was no evidence that acute exacerbation and mortality could be reduced.</P>
<P>Newer types of nutritional supplementation are being evaluated. An interesting study by Broekhuizen showed that an oral dose of 9 g of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) taken daily for eight weeks improved exercise capacity although it did not decrease levels of inflammatory markers (<LINK REF="STD-Broekhuizen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Broekhuizen 2005</LINK>). Association of nutritional support in a small subgroup of depleted patients did not have an additional effect on fat-free mass (both groups received nutritional supplementation). In contrast, Sugawara and colleagues showed, in a smaller number of patients, that nutritional support with omega 3 (PUFA), in association with low-intensity exercise, improved weight, exercise capacity and HRQoL as well as decreasing cytokines, CRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945; (<LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2010</LINK>). The control group showed increases in inflammatory levels.</P>
<P>Laviolete and colleagues provided 16 weeks of pressurised whey for patients with COPD and they demonstrated an improvement in exercise capacity (cycle endurance time), fatigue and emotional control, with no change in inflammatory markers as measured by CRP, IL-6, or advanced oxidation protein products or in quadriceps muscle function (<LINK REF="REF-Laviolette-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laviolette 2010</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2012</LINK> also used whey peptide as the anti-inflammatory nutritional supplementation and low-intensity exercise and again demonstrated a decrease in CRP, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-&#945;. The difference in results could be because of the difference in exercise intensity, the heterogeneity of the population, or both.</P>
<P>Supplementation of essential amino acids for 12 weeks have shown impressive increase in fat-free mass (3.6 kg) with significant improvement in HRQoL in patients with severe COPD and sarcopenia (muscle-depleted patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Dal-Negro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Negro 2010</LINK>). Baldi and colleagues also showed positive effects of essential amino acids (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other ergogenic aides such as creatine (<LINK REF="REF-Fuld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuld 2005</LINK>), L-carnitine (<LINK REF="REF-Borghi_x002d_Silva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borghi-Silva 2006</LINK>), growth hormone releasing factor and appetite stimulants (<LINK REF="REF-Weisberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberg 2002</LINK>) have also been tested in COPD. Increases in lean body mass has not been shown to translate into improved exercise endurance or improved HRQoL. Growth hormone has resulted in improvement in anthropometric measures, but not in exercise capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Burdet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burdet 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2000</LINK>), nutritional support alone failed to show benefit and our recommendations for further research suggested trials that combined modalities. A combination of nutritional supplementation and exercise is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society-European Respiratory Society (ATS-ERS) (<LINK REF="REF-Nici-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006</LINK>) and has been used in recent trials. Other trials have also combined anabolic steroids with nutritional support and will be assessed in an upcoming review. The subgroup analysis in this review did suggest that exercise added some anabolic stimuli in patients with COPD and should be encouraged.</P>
<P>Pison and colleagues compared home health education with combined rehabilitation including health education, exercise, nutritional supplementation and oral testosterone for three months in patients with COPD and chronic respiratory failure (<LINK REF="STD-Pison-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pison 2011</LINK>). There was no improvement in the primary outcome (six-minute walk test), but there was improvement in anthropometric measures (including fat-free mass index) and quality of life in women. Improvement in survival was seen in an per-protocol analysis, but not in an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:57:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:57:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found moderate-quality evidence that nutritional supplementation promotes significant weight gain among patients with COPD, especially if malnourished. Nourished patients may not respond to the same degree to supplemental feeding. We also found a significant change from baseline in fat-free mass index/fat-free mass, fat mass/fat mass index, MAMC (as a measure of lean body mass), six-minute walk test and a significant improvement in skinfold thickness (as measure of fat mass) for all patients. In addition, there was significant improvements in respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP) and overall HRQoL as measured by SGRQ in malnourished patients with COPD.</P>
<P>These results differ from previous reviews and should be considered in the management of malnourished patients with COPD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-30 15:57:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>As there is no high-quality evidence, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. There is growing evidence that nutritional supplementation improves anthropometric measures, muscle strength and quality of life for patients with COPD. The hope is that by improving weight, muscle strength and quality of life, we will also be able to decrease exacerbation and hospitalisations and increase survival. This should be accessed in future prospective trials.</P>
<P>Further outcome studies are required to evaluate the combination of enhanced nutrition, anti-inflammatory nutritional supplements, exercise, vitamin D, anabolic agents (<LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pison-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pison 2011</LINK>), anti-inflammatory nutritional supplements, novel treatments such as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists, neuro electric stimulation and specific anti-inflammatory medications. The effect of these combinations may vary, depending on the COPD phenotype. The use of PUFA (<LINK REF="STD-Broekhuizen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Broekhuizen 2005</LINK>) and essential amino acids (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Negro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Negro 2010</LINK>) associated with exercise seems promising. The response to nutritional supplementation may be linked to a particular phenotype that incorporates disease severity and the level of inflammatory markers; timing of initiating nutritional supplementation in regards to the disease is also an important factor to be further explored. </P>
<P>The studies that included HRQoL, suggest that nutritional supplementation promotes improvement in the quality of life of malnourished patients with COPD. As this is a very important outcome, more trials using these end points are needed.</P>
<P>As this review was performed only in stable COPD, it would also be important to access the response to nutritional supplementation in acute states.</P>

<P>A total of 272 abstracts were identified. After the 2 primary review authors assessed the abstracts, the number was reduced to 55 reports closely related to nutrition and COPD (Kappa for agreement between the review authors 0.89; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96). These were read in detail. Of these studies, 34 were excluded (Kappa 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). Review authors agreed on all except 4 reports. These were sent to a third review author (YL) for arbitration. Reports were excluded for the following reasons: uncontrolled study (6), no randomisation (2), investigations into weight loss without nutritional support (11), nutritional assessment without nutritional support (10), subjects not meeting eligibility criteria (4) and second report in the same trial (1). Reports were then classified according to the type and duration of supplementation and the presence of anabolic substances. Only 2 papers were retrieved in which anabolic steroid supplementation was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>). In a further paper (<LINK REF="STD-Burdet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burdet 1997</LINK>) and an additional abstract (Casaburi 1997, see <LINK REF="STD-Casaburi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casaburi 2004</LINK>), growth hormone was administered. Papers in which the influence of 1 meal was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Efthimiou-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Efthimiou 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akrabawi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Akrabawi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frankfort-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frankfort 1991</LINK>), were excluded as were papers that reported supplementation of 2 weeks or less (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelillo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Angelillo 1985</LINK>)</P>

<P>From an update search conducted in March 2004, a total of 43 references were identified. Of these 10 were retrieved for full-paper assessment. Following the exclusion of duplicate references, 9 studies were identified. One study report was translated from Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2001</LINK>). Studies were excluded because of an inadequate intervention (3); inadequate control (1); assessment of nutritional intervention during an acute phase (1); non-randomised design (1) and assessment of food intake on bioavailability of a pharmacological intervention (1). Two studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goris 2003</LINK>). Three studies remain awaiting assessment as the trialists have yet to confirm methods or data (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fukuoka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fukuoka 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vargas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vargas 1995</LINK>)</P>
