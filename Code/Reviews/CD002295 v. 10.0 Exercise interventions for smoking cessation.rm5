<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-28 12:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of exercise programmes in people who want to quit smoking. We looked at whether exercise programmes, either alone or combined with stop smoking programmes, helped more people to quit at six months or longer than stop smoking programmes alone or stop smoking programmes combined with health education.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Specialist clinics and self-help materials regularly recommend exercise to people who want to quit smoking. Taking regular exercise may help people give up smoking by helping with withdrawal and cravings, and by helping to manage weight gain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to April 2014. We found 20 trials with a total of 5,870 participants. Nine studies were in women only and one study was in men only. Studies varied in the timing and intensity of programmes offered. We only included studies that measured smoking at six months or longer. In most of the trials, the exercise programmes included group and home-based exercise.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Since these studies used different types and intensities of exercise programmes, the results were not combined.</P>
<P>In four studies, people who received the exercise programme were significantly more likely to quit smoking at end of treatment than people who only received a stop smoking programme. Only two of the 20 trials offered evidence for exercise helping people to quit smoking in the long term. In one of these studies, the people in the exercise group had significantly higher quit rates at three-month follow-up and at 12 months, the results from this study were borderline significant. In this study, people who received the exercise programme were more than twice as likely to still be quit at 12 months. Another study reported significantly higher quit rates at six month follow-up for a combined exercise and smoking cessation programme compared with brief smoking cessation advice. The other studies did not find an effect of exercise programmes on quit rates but that could have been because they were small studies or because the exercise programmes were not intense enough.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The level of evidence for whether exercise programmes help people quit smoking is very low and more research is needed. There are issues with study design, possible risk of bias, and differences between the studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-28 09:31:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized trials which compared an exercise programme alone, or an exercise programme as an adjunct to a cessation programme, with a cessation programme (which we considered the control in this review). Studies were required to recruit smokers or recent quitters and have a follow-up of six months or more. Studies that did not meet the full inclusion criteria because they only assessed the acute effects of exercise on smoking behaviour, or because the outcome was smoking reduction, are summarised but not formally included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-28 09:31:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data on study characteristics and smoking outcomes.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-28 12:12:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 20 trials with a total of 5,870 participants. The largest study was an internet trial with 2,318 participants, and eight trials had fewer than 30 people in each treatment arm. Studies varied in the timing and intensity of the smoking cessation and exercise programmes offered. Only one included study was judged to be at low risk of bias across all domains assessed. Four studies showed significantly higher abstinence rates in a physically active group versus a control group at end of treatment. One of these studies also showed a significant benefit for exercise versus control on abstinence at the three-month follow-up and a benefit for exercise of borderline significance (p = 0.05) at the 12-month follow-up. Another study reported significantly higher abstinence rates at six month follow-up for a combined exercise and smoking cessation programme compared with brief smoking cessation advice. One study showed significantly higher abstinence rates for the exercise group versus a control group at the three-month follow-up but not at the end of treatment or 12-month follow-up. The other studies showed no significant effect for exercise on abstinence.</P>

<P>Only two of the 20 trials offered evidence for exercise aiding smoking cessation in the long term. All the other trials were too small to reliably exclude an effect of intervention, or included an exercise intervention which may not have been sufficiently intense to achieve the desired level of exercise. Trials are needed with larger sample sizes, sufficiently intense interventions in terms of both exercise intensity and intensity of support being provided, equal contact control conditions, and measures of exercise adherence and change in physical activity in both exercise and comparison groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-28 12:13:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cancer and hypertension, and is one of the major causes of premature mortality in industrialized nations (<LINK REF="REF-Doll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peto-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1996</LINK>). Stopping smoking prolongs life and reduces morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2002</LINK>). Many attempts to stop smoking are made unaided (<LINK REF="REF-West-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>), with a success rate (6 to 12 months prolonged abstinence) of around 3 to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>). Aided quit attempts, particularly through a combination of behavioural counselling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion or varenicline can improve success rates, but these remain low (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>). More effective smoking cessation interventions are needed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of exercise on tobacco withdrawal and cravings</HEADING>
<P>Exercise has been proposed as an aid for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1981</LINK>). In this review the terms exercise and physical activity (PA) are used interchangeably and refer to both 'lifestyle' physical activities, such as walking, as well as more formal structured activities, such as using a stationary cycle. The severity of 'desire to smoke' reliably predicts relapse in smokers who are trying to stop (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1989</LINK>) and interventions are required which reduce the desire to smoke. In experimental studies, cardiovascular-type exercise has been shown to have an acute effect on reducing both psychological withdrawal symptoms and desire to smoke in abstinent smokers. This has been shown to be the case for both brief (5 to 10 minute) bouts of moderate intensity exercise among smokers who have been abstinent overnight and for 30 to 40 minute bouts of vigorous intensity among smokers who are trying to quit smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Haasova-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haasova 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haasova-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haasova 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK> - also see the table of acute studies in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The mechanism underlying the observed beneficial effect of exercise on withdrawal and cravings is not clear. Exercise has been shown to have some similarities to smoking in its effects on stimulating the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1983</LINK>) and on neurobiological processes in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Dishman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dishman 2009</LINK>), including increasing beta-endorphin levels in smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK>), and consequently it has been argued that exercise may provide an alternative reinforcer to smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Marlatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlatt 1985</LINK>). This argument is consistent with behavioural theories of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Correia--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correia 1998</LINK>) and animal studies have demonstrated that exercise is an effective alternative reinforcer to illicit substances for rats (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Cosgrove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosgrove 2002</LINK>), but no studies could be identified which have investigated the role of exercise as an alternative reinforcer to smoking. It seems plausible that the attention to somatic cues during exercise presents a unique strategy for distracting smokers from the cravings and negative cognitions experienced during smoking abstinence, although the findings from one study suggest that distraction is unlikely to play a major role (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2006</LINK>). Another possible mechanism is that exercise influences cognitive functioning in smokers; for example, exercise appears to reduce attentional bias to smoking images (<LINK REF="STD-Janse-van-Rensburg-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Janse van Rensburg 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Besides the potential benefits of exercise for moderating psychological withdrawal symptoms and cravings, there is evidence for exercise reducing post-smoking cessation weight gain in the long-term (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 2012</LINK>), and for reducing cravings for sweet foods during the first week of abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Teo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teo 2014</LINK>). The weight control benefits of exercise may be of particular importance to female smokers (see <LINK REF="REF-Linke-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linke 2013</LINK> for discussion of exercise interventions for female smokers) who report smoking to control weight (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 1992</LINK>), and report fear of post-cessation weight gain as a motivation for continued smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorenson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorenson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2001</LINK>) and for smoking relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Gritz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gritz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1992</LINK>). Exercise has also been shown to have a positive effect on other factors that may protect against smoking relapse, including perceived coping ability (<LINK REF="REF-Steptoe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steptoe 1989</LINK>) and self esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Spence-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 2005</LINK>). In addition, being physically active has many general health benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>), which have been observed for smokers who have quit (<LINK REF="REF-Albrecht-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrecht 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niaura-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaura 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinton 1997</LINK>) and for continuing smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Colbert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hedblad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedblad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Senti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senti 2001</LINK>). Moreover, a review suggests that participation in regular physical activity satisfies eight of the principles characterising a tobacco harm reduction strategy (<LINK REF="REF-deRuiter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">deRuiter 2006</LINK>). For example, one study observed that physical activity levels were inversely associated with lung carcinoma among current and former smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Leitzmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitzmann 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Associations between exercise and smoking behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from a number of large cross-sectional surveys indicates that levels of PA are inversely related to smoking rates (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Boutelle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutelle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Picavet-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picavet 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takemura-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takemura 2000</LINK>). Among smokers with a depressive disorder attempting to quit, lower physical activity levels at baseline predicted an increased likelihood of relapsing (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2012</LINK>). One survey has shown an association between higher levels of cigarette dependence and lower levels of physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Loprinzi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loprinzi 2014</LINK>). Other evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that this relationship may be influenced by both gender and mode of PA. For example, when only examining leisure-time PA, heavy smoking has been shown to be inversely related to PA in men but not in women (<LINK REF="REF-Schroder--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroder 2003</LINK>). Elsewhere, participation in sport has been negatively associated with smoking in men but not in women (<LINK REF="REF-Helmert--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helmert 1994</LINK>). Additionally, some earlier studies have shown a weak relationship or no relationship between PA and smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>We only found one study (<LINK REF="REF-Sasco-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasco 2002</LINK>) which examined the relationship between smoking and exercise in pre-adolescents, and this cross-sectional study reported a positive association between engaging in PA and 'ever smoking'. Among adolescents, cross-sectional studies have consistently shown that smoking is negatively associated with participation in sport (<LINK REF="REF-Escobedo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobedo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peretti_x002d_Watel--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peretti-Watel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>) and with overall levels of PA (<LINK REF="REF-Coulson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pate-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pate 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verkooijen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkooijen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2003</LINK>). There is some evidence to suggest that this pattern may be different for boys versus girls and some of the evidence is contradictory. For example, a cross-sectional study of adolescents found a negative association between sporting activity and smoking for boys and heavy smoking, but not for girls or for lighter smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Peretti_x002d_Watel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peretti-Watel 2002</LINK>). Another study observed no association between sports participation and smoking levels in males (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>), while a prospective study found that leisure-time PA was positively associated with initiating smoking for girls but not for boys (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 1995</LINK>). Two prospective studies found that higher levels of PA reduced the odds of starting smoking for boys and girls both during childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Audrain_x002d_McGovern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audrain-McGovern 2003</LINK>) and adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Kujala-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kujala 2007</LINK>). One study showed that the negative association between physical activity and smoking is mediated by having a physically active identity (<LINK REF="REF-Verkooijen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkooijen 2008</LINK>). A detailed review of studies examining associations between smoking and physical activity has been published by <LINK REF="REF-Kaczynski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaczynski 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>Smokers trying to quit are likely to be more receptive to an active lifestyle than smokers in general (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1996</LINK>). An exercise-based smoking cessation intervention has been found to significantly improve cardiovascular disease biomarkers (e.g. inflammatory markers) within three months (<LINK REF="REF-Korhonen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korhonen 2011</LINK>) and smokers report that they value exercise as a strategy for reducing the risk of developing tobacco-related disease (<LINK REF="REF-Haddock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddock 2004</LINK>). In addition, higher levels of exercise are associated with less depression in smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>). Being physically active has been positively associated with initiating a quit attempt (<LINK REF="REF-deRuiter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">deRuiter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaulthier-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaulthier 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haddock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddock 2000</LINK>), with confidence to maintain smoking abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-King-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1996</LINK>) and with success at stopping smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Abrantes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrantes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derby 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paavola-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paavola 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sedgwick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedgwick 1988</LINK>), although one large survey found no association between exercise levels and intention to quit smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1998</LINK>). Other work shows a positive trend between avoiding relapse to smoking and physical health and fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Metheny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metheny 1998</LINK>) and a significantly reduced risk of smoking relapse among those who are more physically active (<LINK REF="REF-McDermot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermot 2009</LINK>), including among those with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, from the above evidence one might hypothesize that pursuing regular exercise during an attempt to stop smoking could act both to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings and to increase rates of smoking cessation. In practice, exercise has for many years been routinely recommended as an aid to smoking cessation by specialist smoking clinics (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Everson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1992</LINK>), by pharmaceutical companies (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Boots-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boots 1998</LINK>), in self-help guides (<LINK REF="REF-Ashelman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashelman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2004</LINK> ), by physical therapists (<LINK REF="REF-Pignataro-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignataro 2012</LINK>), and in national guidelines (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Quit-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quit 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodhouse-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodhouse 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2008</LINK>), and many smokers are likely to view physical activity as an aid to quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Everson_x002d_Hock-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everson-Hock 2010a</LINK>). In the short term, most smokers are unlikely to spontaneously increase their levels of PA after quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vander-Weg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vander Weg 2001</LINK>), and the present review examines studies which have evaluated exercise interventions as an aid to smoking cessation.</P>
<P>The objective of the main review is to evaluate studies on the effect of exercise on smoking cessation after at least six months. Two secondary questions are also addressed: the acute effects of exercise on smoking related outcomes, and, for this update of the review, the effects of physical activity on levels of cigarette consumption. Evidence for the acute effects of exercise on cigarette cravings and withdrawal provides the main rationale for promoting exercise for smoking cessation; therefore we consider it important to present these studies. The effect of a physical activity intervention on levels of cigarette consumption is important as there is increasing interest in the effectiveness of interventions (pharmacological and behavioural) targeting smoking harm reduction (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). While smoking cessation is the ultimate goal of interventions, there is evidence that cessation can be induced through smoking reduction, among both smokers who wish to quit and those who do not. Exercise interventions that seek to reduce cigarette consumption, whether it be to implicitly or explicitly lead to a quit attempt, are therefore reviewed.</P>

<P>We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group for studies including the terms 'exercise' or 'physical activity' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. At the time of the search in April 2014 the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), issue 3, 2014; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20140321; EMBASE (via OVID) to week 201413; and PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20140317. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/sect0-meta.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> in the Cochrane Library for full search strategies and list of other resources searched. We also searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL Plus, using the terms 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'exercise', 'physical activity', and 'intervention' (searches completed May 2014). We also carried out a hand search of reference lists and conference abstracts, conducted additional searches on key authors, and contacted key authors.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-28 12:14:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted the following data from each study report: study design; recruitment and randomisation method; subject characteristics including age, gender, smoking behaviour, and exercise levels at entry; sample size; description of exercise and smoking cessation programmes (including number of sessions and duration); rates of exercise adherence; control conditions; length of follow-up; definition of cessation; and method of validation. The primary outcome was quitting at longest follow-up using the strictest definition of abstinence reported in the study. Data on change in cigarette consumption was also extracted.</P>
<P>Due to the differences in study design and intervention, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. For each study the risk ratio for quitting at longest follow-up ((number of events in intervention condition/intervention denominator)/ (number of events in control condition/control denominator)) and the 95% confidence interval were displayed graphically. Where the event is defined as smoking cessation, an RR greater than one indicates that more people successfully quit in the treatment group than in the control group.</P>
<P>Unless noted otherwise, quit rates are calculated based on numbers randomised to an intervention or control, and exclude any deaths or untraceable moves. We regard participants who dropped out or were lost to follow-up as continuing to smoke. We have where possible conducted intention-to-treat analyses (i.e., all participants initially assigned to intervention or control are included in their original groups).</P>
<P>Included studies were assessed for risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) and attrition bias (incomplete follow-up) in accordance with Cochrane guidelines.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>The literature search revealed a number of trials which did not satisfy the inclusion criteria (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table), but had exercise as an independent variable and smoking cessation behaviour as a dependent variable. These studies mainly fell into four categories:</P>
<P>(a) Multiple independent and dependent variables: a number of studies were identified in which exercise was one element in a multiple risk factor intervention, with smoking cessation behaviour as one of a number of health-related outcomes. The specific effects of exercise on smoking cessation could not be determined due to possible interaction and confounding between the independent variables. For example, it is not possible to separate the effects on smoking cessation due to a change in diet versus a change in exercise.</P>
<P>(b) Multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable: these studies included multiple smoking cessation elements one of which was exercise. In these studies the specific effects of exercise on smoking abstinence were not addressed.</P>
<P>(c) Single independent variable and multiple dependent variables: in these studies exercise was encouraged without a smoking cessation programme, and changes in various health and behavioural indices including smoking cessation were examined. None of these studies found a significant effect on smoking abstinence for the active condition. However, as these studies did not record the number of smokers who were trying to stop, it is difficult to evaluate their success.</P>
<P>(d) Acute studies: These experimental studies assessed the acute impact of an exercise intervention on withdrawal symptoms and desire to smoke, mostly following temporary abstinence. Details and findings of these studies are shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and summarised in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>
<P>(e) Did not meet other inclusion criteria: These studies either had a follow-up of less than six months, did not include all smokers who wish to quit at the outset, did not include a non-exercise control group or did not have smoking abstinence as an outcome. Studies which reported change in cigarette consumption are included in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>

Four studies showed significantly higher abstinence rates in a physically active group versus a control group at end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>). One of these studies also showed a benefit for exercise versus control on abstinence at the three-month follow-up and a benefit for exercise of borderline significance at the 12-month follow-up point (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>). The latter study showed a difference in abstinence rates for the exercise condition compared with the control of 11.9% versus 5.4% (p = 0.05, RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.96) at the 12-month follow-up. One study observed significantly higher cessation rates for a condition combining exercise with a cessation programme compared with a brief advice only control group at three and six month follow-ups (at six months: p = 0.013, RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.49), but the differences were not significant when comparing the exercise condition with a cessation programme plus brief advice (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>). In this study, abstinence was not biochemically validated at six months. One study showed significantly higher abstinence rates for the exercise group versus a control group at the three-month follow-up but not at the end of treatment or 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>). The latter study also found that those with higher levels of exercise adherence were significantly more likely to achieve smoking abstinence at the end of treatment. The other studies showed no significant effect for exercise on abstinence. Several of the studies showed a trend for higher rates of abstinence in the exercise condition compared with the controls (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>). Only seven studies had a sufficiently large sample size to have a good prospect of detecting a significant difference between the treatment and control conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>).

<P>The evidence on the effectiveness of exercise interventions for smoking cessation is very limited (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Four of the 20 studies found an effect in favour of the intervention at end of treatment, one study detected a borderline significant difference in favour of the intervention at 12 months, and one study detected a significant difference at six months when evaluating an exercise programme as an adjunct to brief advice, but not when comparing the exercise programme to a more intensive smoking cessation programme. Key limitations to the body of evidence include clinical heterogeneity, unclear risk of bias, issues with generalisabilty to other population groups, and issues with study design and outcome measures. These are explored in more detail below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cessation programmes</HEADING>
<P>In one study the effect of the treatment may have been compromised by the smoking cessation programme being limited to a single counselling session (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>). In this study the interventions were not intended to initiate smoking abstinence but rather to maintain abstinence in smokers following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Thus the results, which did not show any benefit for exercise, cannot easily be generalized beyond abstaining post-AMI smokers. This trial also compared the combined effect on smoking abstinence of four different exercise interventions with the combined effect of two different control interventions; therefore it was not possible to relate outcomes for smoking cessation to specific interventions. This study is further limited by providing smoking cessation counselling for only one of the two control conditions.</P>
<P>The results of one of the studies, showing a positive effect for exercise on smoking abstinence at end of treatment, may have been confounded by the exercise group receiving a different cessation programme than the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>). In two studies showing a significant benefit of exercise versus control at end of treatment the exercise condition received more staff contact time than the control (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>), leading to the question of whether the outcomes for abstinence were due to exercise alone or due to additional social support.</P>
<P>It has been recommended that a smoking cessation programme should start before the quit date and continue into the period of abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Raw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raw 1998</LINK>). Yet almost half of the trials did not do this (<LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>). With the provision of more extensive cessation programmes the impact of the interventions may have been more pronounced. Furthermore, only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>) described an intervention in which the smoking cessation and exercise components were integrated in such a way as to reinforce exercise as a coping strategy for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Marlatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlatt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2010</LINK>). For example, the potential for exercise to be used to reduce cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>) was not made explicit in the majority of studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Target populations</HEADING>
<P>Demographic factors, such as age, gender, weight, fitness level, socioeconomic status and occupation could influence outcomes for both smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vangeli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vangeli 2011</LINK>) and exercise behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Caspersen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caspersen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pate-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pate 1995</LINK>). Of the nine trials which recruited men and women, four compared outcomes by gender. Of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1993</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK> reported no gender differences, and <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> observed significantly higher abstinence rates for males, but not for females, at three and six month follow-ups, in a teenage population. None of the studies considered outcomes relative to occupation, socioeconomic status or age. It is possible that the relationship between demographic variables and outcomes was not explored in some of the studies because of small sample sizes. All but four of the studies were North American. Thirteen studies recorded ethnic status, and all reported a predominantly white sample. Researchers must consider whether these results can be generalized to other national and ethnic populations (<LINK REF="REF-Caspersen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caspersen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 1996</LINK>). One trial recruited post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, another targeted teenage smokers (aged 14 to 19 years), and the remaining trials recruited from the general population of smokers. Trials are needed among other populations of smokers who might especially benefit from an exercise intervention. Given the high prevalence of smoking among those with mental illness, and the established benefits of regular physical activity for mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Stathopoulou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathopoulou 2006</LINK>), research is needed to examine the role that physical activity may play as an aid to quitting. Those with serious mental illness are likely to be receptive to exercise as an aid to cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour_x002d_Nicitopoulos-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour-Nicitopoulos 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arbour_x002d_Nicitopoulos-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arbour-Nicitopoulos 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2007</LINK>) and an exercise intervention has been successfully piloted among women smokers with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vickers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vickers 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> showed that teenage smokers are likely to benefit from an exercise intervention. An excluded study explored a sport-based intervention for smoking prevention in pre-adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Trigwell-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Trigwell 2014</LINK>). Obese quitters may have a particular need for weight control interventions, such as exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Lycett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lycett 2011</LINK>), and we have yet to see a trial of exercise focusing on this population. Additionally, a non-pharmaceutical intervention such as exercise is likely to appeal to pregnant smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2007</LINK>) and a recently completed trial is assessing the effects of an exercise intervention in this population (<LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven studies did not present the participants' level of exercise at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>). All the remaining studies, except <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>, reported that they had recruited fairly sedentary smokers. A substantial proportion of smokers may be physically active (<LINK REF="REF-deRuiter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">deRuiter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emmons-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmons 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scioli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scioli 2009</LINK>) and there is some evidence that regular exercisers may be more successful at quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Abrantes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrantes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derby 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paavola-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paavola 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sedgwick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedgwick 1988</LINK>), yet it is not clear whether exercise interventions are effective as an aid to smoking cessation for a more active population.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK> reported a significantly smaller weight gain for those in the exercise condition compared with the controls at the end of treatment; however, those in the exercise condition weighed more than the controls at baseline, and this difference was not controlled for, which makes interpretation of the finding problematic. <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK> did not find any significant differences in weight change between the treatment conditions at the three-month or 12-month follow-ups. <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK> observed no difference in weight gain at end of treatment when comparing cognitive-behavioural support plus nicotine patches with exercise plus nicotine patches; however, at end-of-treatment those in the exercise only condition gained significantly less weight than those receiving only cognitive-behavioural support. Other studies found no difference in weight gain for the exercise versus controls at end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> (BMI); <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>), at three- and six-month follow-ups (<LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>), or at 12 months post-cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>).

The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK> included nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and post-cessation weight gain is likely to be less pronounced when using NRT (<LINK REF="REF-Jorenby-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorenby 1996</LINK>). Therefore, the potential for exercise to moderate weight gain was reduced. It is possible that exercise provides a role in weight management once an individual has stopped using NRT, but this has yet to be determined.</P>
<P>When pooling the studies, <LINK REF="REF-Farley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 2012</LINK> found no evidence for exercise moderating weight gain at end of treatment, but reported a benefit at 12 months follow-up when combining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>). The authors concluded that 'More studies are needed to clarify whether this is an effect of treatment or a chance finding'. An earlier publication conducted a meta-analysis with 10 studies of weight management interventions during smoking cessation, including five of the studies included in the current review (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>), and observed a significant benefit for the intervention in the short-term (&lt; three months), but not in the long-term (&gt; six months) (<LINK REF="REF-Spring-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spring 2009</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK> provides some indication that combining nicotine patches and exercise enhances abstinence compared with exercise alone, as would be expected given the established efficacy of NRT (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>). Future studies need to establish whether exercise offers additional benefits to those provided by NRT, and other smoking cessation medications, alone.

In studies where the exercise programme started after a period of smoking abstinence the potential for exercise to moderate withdrawal symptoms during this period was lost (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>). In practice, when the exercise programme begins may depend on individual capabilities and preferences (<LINK REF="REF-Everson_x002d_Hock-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everson-Hock 2010b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the two studies with exercise programmes lasting for less than six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>), the intervention may have been of insufficient length to encourage long-term exercise adherence. Most of the trials employed supervised, group-based exercise supplemented by a home-based programme. Where home programmes were not provided (<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>) it is possible that the participants' high level of dependence on supervised exercise reduced their level of post-intervention activity.

<P>Those adequately powered trials not showing a consistent effect of exercise on smoking abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>) had interventions of a low intensity, in that they promoted moderate intensity rather than vigorous intensity exercise. In one case they relied solely on fairly brief exercise counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>), another focused on telephone-based counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>), in two other studies supervised exercise was only provided once per week (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>), and the remaining study relied on a web-based programme (<LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>). In these studies the exercise intervention may have been insufficiently intense to benefit smoking abstinence. Further studies are required to establish the optimum intensity of exercise intervention required as an aid to smoking cessation. Intensity here refers to both the exercise intensity per se (i.e. light, moderate or vigorous) and the extensiveness of the support being provided (e.g. number of supervised exercise sessions). The findings from <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK> suggest that abstaining smokers may need to accumulate at least 110 minutes of activity per week to maintain abstinence (at least during the intervention period), and supervised exercise on two or three days a week may be necessary to achieve this. A recent pilot study showed promising findings for an intervention involving moderate intensity exercise supervised on three days a week over eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2010</LINK>) and this needs to be tested in a larger trial.</P>

However, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about whether various aspects of the intervention affected levels of exercise adherence after the formal supervised programme ended because none of the studies reported rates of adherence for this period.</P>

All the studies included goal setting, nine used self-monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>), one used reinforcement (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1993</LINK> used telephone follow-up in the case of non-attendance, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK> used remote monitoring of heart rate, and two studies provided pedometers (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>). Two trials employed exercise counselling, including a broad range of cognitive-behavioural techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies did not report overall activity levels for the treatment group during the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>). Where supervised exercise was offered, attendance at these sessions was high. Where the emphasis was on home-based exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>) only a minority of the participants achieved the criterion level of exercise. For example, in one study combining home-based exercise with one supervised session of exercise per week, 50% of those in the exercise group were still classed as sedentary at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>). One study reported greater attrition for the exercise group compared with the controls (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK> - see <LINK REF="REF-Borrelli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrelli 2002</LINK>). Two studies reported lower attendance for the exercise intervention compared with the health education programme (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>). The one internet-based trial observed very similar levels of physical activity for the two groups at the six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-McKay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 2008</LINK>). Future studies need to consider other methods for increasing 'home-based' physical activity. For example, pedometers have been used to increase participation in a walking-based intervention during smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2008</LINK>). However, when using a pedometer and counselling-based intervention <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> observed no effect on physical activity levels in teens, while <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK> used a similar intervention and found a significant increase in leisure time physical activity for the exercise group versus control group, but no effect on overall physical activity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Fitness measures</HEADING>
<P>Although many of the studies reported fitness measures for the control group during the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>), less than half of them reported physical activity (PA) levels for the control group at this time (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>). Therefore, in the majority of the studies the relative increase in PA in the treatment group versus any spontaneous increase in activity in the control group could not be accurately monitored. During the follow-up period none of the studies described using cognitive-behavioural techniques to encourage regular exercise, although <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK> offered physical activity consultations up until the end of a six month intervention. Only three of the studies assessed fitness during the follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Ciccolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>) and only two studies reported levels of activity at 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>). Therefore, for the vast majority of studies it was not possible to relate long-term smoking abstinence to exercise behaviour.</P>
<P>Fitness measures are useful as a confirmation of exercise adherence. However, the significance of changes in fitness in the context of smoking cessation is debatable. Since exercise has been shown to benefit psychological and general health without increases in fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Pate-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pate 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2008</LINK>) it is possible that exercise could aid smoking cessation independently of changes in physical capacity. A number of the trials reported a significant increase in fitness levels at the end of the treatment period within the active exercise condition (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK> (see also <LINK REF="REF-Albrecht-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrecht 1998</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>). Four studies showed an increase in fitness for the intervention conditions compared with the controls at end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>); others showed no differences at end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>), at a four-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>), or a 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Psychological measures</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the studies used psychological measures at baseline and eleven trials reported changes in these measures (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1988</LINK> found a significant increase in Profile of Mood States (POMs) tension-anxiety scores for the active group compared with the controls at four months follow-up. These findings are not consistent with the general consensus that exercise reduces mood disturbance, stress, and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Stathopoulou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathopoulou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2008</LINK>). The reported effect on psychological outcomes may have been caused by extraneous variables which could not be controlled for with a small sample size. <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK> found no significant treatment differences on mood (POMs) or depression (Beck Depression Inventory) when comparing measures taken at baseline and seven days post-quit; these findings may have been influenced by the sample including a large number of individuals with a history of major depression. <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK> showed that reports of self efficacy for stopping smoking were higher in a cognitive-behavioural support condition compared with an exercise-only condition. <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK> did not find a significant change in reports of tobacco withdrawal symptoms and cigarette cravings for exercise versus controls across the treatment period. <LINK REF="STD-Kinnunen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnunen 2008</LINK> did not find any difference in reports of withdrawal symptoms for the exercise group versus the controls at one week post-cessation. <LINK REF="STD-Bize-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bize 2010</LINK> found no significant differences in reports of withdrawal symptoms, depression, urges to smoke, or perceived stress for the exercise group versus the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK> observed that, among 40 women who were abstinent at the end of treatment, those who increased their fitness were more likely to report decreases in depressive symptoms (see <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2003</LINK> observed a reduction in some withdrawal symptoms for exercise versus controls up to three weeks post-cessation. <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2012</LINK> observed no effects of a yoga intervention on anxiety, depression, or temptations to smoke. <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK> found no group differences in tobacco withdrawal symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK> reported significantly lower somatic withdrawal symptoms and sleep disturbance for the exercise versus control group; there were no group differences for craving, mood disturbance, or positive affect. <LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK> was the only study which examined the effect of exercise on sleep disturbance, and this may be a worthwhile objective. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Grove-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grove 2006</LINK> observed that, compared with controls, regular participation in exercise, during the period of tobacco withdrawal, did not affect the ability to stay asleep but exercisers reported significantly less difficulty falling asleep. It would also be valuable if affective changes after exercise were assessed among different subgroups of smokers. For example, one study observed that, among women smokers with increased concern about weight gain, engagement in exercise was associated with less of an increase in negative affect following smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acute effect of exercise on tobacco withdrawal and cravings</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> presents a summary of 41 studies we identified which have assessed the acute effects of exercise on smoking outcomes. Since the previous version of this review a further 14 studies have been added. Three studies focused on outcomes related to smoking intake (<LINK REF="STD-Kurti-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kurti 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reeser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Reeser 1983</LINK>). The remaining 38 studies included outcomes related to tobacco withdrawal/mood and/or tobacco cravings. Six studies assessed outcomes during an attempt to quit smoking (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arbour_x002d_Nicitopoulos-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour-Nicitopoulos 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bock 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2011</LINK>). Of these studies, compared with a passive control group, two reported a significant reduction in mood related withdrawal symptoms and cigarette cravings (<LINK REF="STD-Abrantes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abrantes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bock 1999</LINK>), and one showed that exercise increased energy and reduced tiredness but had no effect on cravings (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2011</LINK>). In addition, two single-group studies observed a significant post-exercise reduction in withdrawal and cravings (<LINK REF="STD-Harper-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2013</LINK>). Just one of the studies involving a quit attempt found no effect of exercise on cravings or withdrawal symptoms and this was among those with serious mental illness (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour_x002d_Nicitopoulos-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour-Nicitopoulos 2011</LINK>). We found 32 studies that examined the acute effects of exercise on withdrawal symptoms and/or cravings among temporarily abstinent smokers and all but six of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Everson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Everson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerleau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerleau 1987</LINK>) observed a significant reduction in cravings and/or withdrawal symptoms compared with a passive control. One of these studies, for the first time, demonstrated a reduction in cravings, for an exercise versus passive group, among pregnant smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2014</LINK>). Previous reviews of 14 or 15 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Haasova-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haasova 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>) provide a more detailed discussion but this section highlights some findings from more recent studies which have shown an acute benefit of exercise during temporary smoking abstinence. These studies showed that, compared with a passive condition, after periods of up to 24 hours without smoking, smokers have lower cravings, withdrawal symptoms and negative affect during and for up to 30 minutes post-exercise. The effects are evident for moderate and vigorous intensity exercise, for Hatha Yoga, and for durations from five minutes of seated isometric exercise to 20 to 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity. Encouragingly, findings suggest relatively convenient forms of physical activity (e.g. 10 to 15 minutes of brisk walking) can be effective.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Haasova-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haasova 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK> have quantified the effects of a single bout of exercise on reducing strength of desire to smoke using 15 studies; the pooled estimates for treatment effect (non-standardised mean difference) were -1.91 and -2.41, respectively, with a high degree of between-study heterogeneity. There has been a tendency for studies with shorter bouts of exercise to show a less sustained effect on reducing cravings and withdrawal and further research is needed to understand how the dose of exercise impacts on the duration of acute effects. However, even brief bouts of exercise, with a brief effect, may be useful to cope with a temporary spike in cravings.</P>
<P>Several mechanisms have been tested among these studies for how exercise reduces cravings. Distraction (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2006</LINK>) does not appear to explain the effects. Exercise expectancy was modestly associated with psychological symptoms, but not with cigarette cravings, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Harper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2013</LINK>) and did not explain any of the effects in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2007</LINK>). In two studies changes in cortisol concentration were unrelated to changes in cravings (<LINK REF="STD-Janse-Van-Rensburg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Janse Van Rensburg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scerbo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Scerbo 2010</LINK>). This suggests that cortisol changes do not mediate the effects of exercise on cravings. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2006a</LINK> reported that reductions in urges to smoke in response to exercise were mediated by reductions in tension. Three studies involving functional Magnetic Resonance Imagery (fMRI) scanning suggested that parts of the brain that are typically activated by smoking cues (images) were less activated following moderate intensity exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Janse-van-Rensburg-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Janse van Rensburg 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janse-van-Rensburg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Janse van Rensburg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janse-Van-Rensburg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Janse Van Rensburg 2012</LINK>). Finally, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Janse-van-Rensburg-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Janse van Rensburg 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2014</LINK>) reported that after exercise, compared with rest, abstinent smokers had less attentional bias (gaze or dwell time, measured using eye-tracker technology) towards smoking images, compared with neutral images presented simultaneously. Shifts in attentional bias away from smoking-related cues, after exercise, are in line with other studies in which participants report improvements in concentration (as a withdrawal symptom) after exercise (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2006</LINK>). Further work is needed to understand how different types of exercise (e.g. isometric, resistance, cardiovascular) influence symptoms known to cause relapse among actual quitters, and among those using pharmaceutical aids to cessation, in which case symptoms may be lower at the outset. In addition to studies focusing on self-reported cravings, seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katomeri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Katomeri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurti-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kurti 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reeser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Reeser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thayer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thayer 1993</LINK>;) reported that a bout of exercise delayed ad libitum smoking, or favourably influenced smoking topography, although three other studies observed no significant effect on ad libitum smoking or smoking topography (<LINK REF="STD-De-Jesus-2014" TYPE="STUDY">De Jesus 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2014</LINK>). Overall, given this experimental evidence further research is needed to understand how best to promote the use of acute bouts of physical activity, in contrast to longer scheduled bouts of exercise, as a momentary aid to smoking cessation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects of exercise interventions on smoking reduction</HEADING>
<P>In this update of the review, for the first time, we include a review of studies that assessed the effect of a PA intervention on levels of cigarette consumption. This is the first review we are aware of on this topic. This issue is important as many smokers say that they wish to reduce cigarette consumption before quitting, reduction for those who want to quit has been shown to be as effective for smoking cessation as abrupt approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Lindson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindson 2010</LINK>), and reduction approaches are recommended in national guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK> review that informed the guidelines did not explicitly search for &#8216;exercise&#8217; studies that may have aided reduction, and none were reported. This section of the review includes any studies, irrespective of study design, which report the effects of a PA intervention on rates of cigarette consumption. The ultimate aim of the majority of these studies was quitting; therefore, we also report outcomes for attempts to quit and for smoking abstinence and state whether these were primary or secondary outcomes. A table of studies assessing the effect of physical activity on levels of cigarette consumption is presented in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. Our searches identified 14 studies and five of these are also included in the main review of smoking cessation studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> (smoking reduction reported in <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>). Two studies were published in the 1980s and the remainder were reported since 2007.</P>
<P>In the majority of studies smoking cessation was defined as the primary outcome and smoking reduction as a secondary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>). Two studies defined smoking reduction as the sole primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK>). Changes in PA levels were primary and smoking levels were secondary in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kovelis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kovelis 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK> defined mental and physical well-being as the main outcome and cigarette consumption as secondary. Finally, one study identified both smoking abstinence and cigarette consumption as primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>All ten studies with smoking cessation as an outcome provided a smoking cessation intervention; in addition, <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK> provided a smoking cessation intervention but did not assess rates of smoking abstinence. In most of these cessation studies the participants wished to quit smoking immediately and smoking reduction was measured &#8216;incidentally&#8217; without a specific goal to reduce. In one study the participants wished to reduce but not quit immediately; PA was used to assist reduction and inducing quit attempts was a research goal but this was not an explicit goal for the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>). In one case participants were seriously thinking about quitting in the next 30 days and exercise was used to prepare for and aid a quit attempt (<LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK> reported that 71% of participants were in the preparation or contemplation stage of change for quitting smoking, and the level of intention to quit was not stated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>). Among the three non-smoking cessation studies, in one study participants&#8217; intention to quit was not stated and the aim was solely to reduce smoking levels as a harm reduction strategy among individuals with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>) and in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kovelis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kovelis 2012</LINK> intention to quit was not reported, nor were participants advised to reduce their smoking (i.e. smoking reduction was assessed incidentally following a PA programme). Only one study encouraged specific strategies for smoking reduction, and in this case four strategies (hierarchical reduction, smoke free periods, scheduled reduction, planned reduction) were offered to smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twelve of the 14 studies were RCTs and the remaining two had a single group within-subjects design (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>). Seven had a sample of less than 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovelis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kovelis 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>). No studies reported power calculations related to examining the effect on smoking reduction, and among the smoking cessation studies only three had large enough samples to have a realistic chance of detecting an effect on smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>). Five studies were identified as pilot or feasibility studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The large majority of studies were based in North America. Four studies targeted more sedentary smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>), and all but two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>) reported that participants were smoking a mean or median of at least 10 cigarettes a day at baseline. Most studies targeted smokers in general, while five targeted the following specific populations: post-acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>); diagnosis of depression (<LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>); diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>); teenagers (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>); and pregnant smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>). Males and females were recruited in most studies, one trial only included men (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>), and four were women only trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>). Half the studies provided supervised exercise (i.e. under the guidance of an instructor) (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>), four provided only PA counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>), two provided just a pedometer-based programme (<LINK REF="STD-Kovelis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kovelis 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>), and one was based solely on a text message-based PA programme (<LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>). All the studies focused on cardiovascular type exercise (e.g. brisk walking). Four of the studies did not report levels of adherence to the PA intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>). In the studies reporting PA adherence, three observed no significant difference in PA levels for the PA versus control group (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>). Some studies included a multi-component intervention targeting behaviours other than smoking and PA (<LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>). Only three studies reinforced PA as a method for reducing cigarette consumption or increasing cessation (e.g. through promoting exercise as a means for coping with cigarette cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and weight gain) (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 14 studies identified, just one reported a significant smoking reduction for the PA versus control group, at 16 weeks post-baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>). Two further studies observed significantly lower absolute levels of smoking for a PA group versus control at 23 week post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>) and 24 weeks after quit day (<LINK REF="STD-Maddison-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maddison 2014</LINK>), although they did not analyse the changes in smoking relative to baseline. One study reported a significant smoking reduction in the PA group but not in the control group (group differences were not analysed) (<LINK REF="STD-Leelarungrayub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leelarungrayub 2010</LINK>), two studies with a single PA group reported a significant smoking reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whiteley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whiteley 2007</LINK>), one trial reported significantly lower smoking levels for a cessation programme versus a PA programme (<LINK REF="STD-Prapavessis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prapavessis 2007</LINK>), and one study did not report the group effect but observed that those with higher rates of PA adherence were more likely to reduce their cigarette consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among the remaining five studies, all not reporting any significant smoking reductions, there were notable methodological challenges which hampered their chances of detecting any effects: two had samples of less than 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2011</LINK>); two had PA interventions may have been insufficiently intense to significantly raise PA levels (<LINK REF="STD-Gorini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gorini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ybarra-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ybarra 2013</LINK>) (brief PA counselling alone, text message support alone, respectively); and one targeted pregnant smokers at around 16 weeks gestation, the majority of which had already markedly reduced their smoking levels relative to before their pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Ussher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ussher 2012</LINK>). All these five studies that did not report a significant effect did report a trend such that the smoking reduction tended to be higher for the PA group versus the control group.</P>
<P>In conclusion, we observed that only one of 14 studies observed a significant smoking reduction for the PA versus control group (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>). Notably, this study also reported that, compared with the control group, a significantly greater proportion of those in the PA group made a quit attempt. The remaining studies either did not report reduction levels for a PA versus control group or had methodological challenges which limited their chances of detecting a significant difference. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK> was by far the most rigorous study as it was an RCT, with a sufficiently large sample size to have a realistic chance of detecting a significant effect on short-term reduction outcomes, recruiting men and women who wished to reduce but not quit in the next month. Reduction strategies were incorporated, exercise was promoted as a reduction strategy, the intervention was sufficient to result in a significant increase in PA levels for the PA versus control group, follow-up support was offered and, as well as smoking reduction, quit attempts and smoking cessation were assessed. However, this was a feasibility study which only followed-up participants to 16 weeks post-baseline. Larger trials with methods comparable to those used by <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK> are needed with a follow-up of at least six months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall commentary</HEADING>
<P>A comparison of the studies was complicated by differences in study design and intervention, and by the relative paucity of rigorous research in this field. There were marked variations between the studies in the length, type, and timing of the exercise intervention, in the design of the control condition and cessation programme, and in the demographic factors recorded. In addition, there was often a lack of data relating to the physical activity levels of the control groups, and of either group during the follow-up period. Together, these factors restricted meaningful comparison of results between studies. The findings presented in this review have implications for future research in this field. One of the first requirements for future work must be to have trials with larger sample sizes.</P>
<P>It is possible that a greater integration between the smoking cessation and exercise programmes may have enhanced abstinence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2010</LINK>). In future research exercise could be presented more as a self-control strategy as well as as a means of increasing fitness and general health and of managing body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Marlatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlatt 1985</LINK>). For example, in initiating abstinence, exercise could be presented as a strategy for managing withdrawal symptoms and overcoming physical dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>). The evidence we have reviewed consistently demonstrates the benefits of an acute bout of exercise on alleviating cravings and withdrawal symptoms under optimum conditions for observing such an effect (i.e. with experimentally manipulated increased baseline cravings &#8211; through temporary abstinence, and in some cases in the presence of smoking related cues, prior to exercising). As regards relapse prevention, exercise could be presented as a strategy which increases self esteem and pride in one's health, and reinforces an identity as a non-smoker and as a physically active person (<LINK REF="REF-Verkooijen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkooijen 2008</LINK>) in such a way that being a smoker is incompatible with these perceptions (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1998</LINK>). Critically, it is likely that exercise needs to be maintained for it to continue to aid smoking cessation. An ongoing trial is assessing the effectiveness of a home and community-based lifestyle exercise maintenance intervention in assisting women to <I>maintain</I> exercise following the termination of an exercise aided smoking cessation program, and hence reduce smoking relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgeorge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgeorge 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>At what point should the smoker who is trying to quit begin an exercise programme? In the studies reviewed, there was wide variation in the timing of the exercise programme. Some recommendations for changes in exercise and smoking behaviour are for sequential rather than simultaneous changes but this is likely to be specific to the individual's needs (<LINK REF="REF-Emmons-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmons 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Everson-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everson 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEwen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwen 2006</LINK>). Another study showed a tendency for higher quit rates among those increasing exercise simultaneously rather than sequentially (<LINK REF="REF-Hyman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyman 2007</LINK>). It has been argued that a physical activity programme should begin prior to quitting, thereby allowing individuals to adjust to the demands of being more active before significantly changing their smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1995</LINK>). Elsewhere, it has been shown that abstaining smokers are more confident about adopting exercise than those preparing to quit (<LINK REF="REF-King-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1996</LINK>), which would support beginning an exercise programme when already abstinent, although delaying the start of the programme reduces the potential for managing withdrawal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007b</LINK>). A quasi-experimental study has reported higher adherence rates for smokers who undergo an exercise regimen commencing eight weeks before the quit day compared with those starting exercise on the quit day (<LINK REF="REF-Patten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patten 2001</LINK>). Further empirical work is required in order to ascertain the relative benefits of initiating exercise at different points in the cessation schedule. All of the 20 studies in the main review only included smokers who wished to attempt to quit smoking and to do so 'abruptly'; a recent feasibility study has shown the potential for exercise being used to increase quit attempts, through first gradually reducing their smoking intake, among those who are not motivated to initiate such an attempt (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2014</LINK>) and further studies are needed in this area (see above section 'Effect of exercise interventions on smoking reduction'). Certainly, the majority of the studies we have reviewed did not demonstrate a significant smoking reduction among individuals in a physical activity treatment arm.</P>
<P>Only one study with balanced contact time showed a long-term effect of exercise on smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1999</LINK>). This study combined a vigorous intensity, thrice weekly supervised exercise programme with cognitive-behavioural support. It has yet to be determined whether a less intensive exercise intervention can aid smoking cessation. Additionally, among teenagers, <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2011</LINK> reported significantly higher abstinence rates at six-month follow-up for a combined exercise and smoking cessation programme compared with brief smoking cessation advice. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of exercise for smoking cessation amongst young smokers. Finally, there is no evidence of harm in promoting physical activity to smokers.That is, no studies report reduced smoking cessation rates in an exercise group compared with control conditions and exercise has many benefits as a harm reduction strategy for smokers (<LINK REF="REF-deRuiter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">deRuiter 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only two of the 20 trials reviewed offered evidence for exercise aiding smoking cessation in the long term. The trials which did not show a significant effect of exercise on smoking abstinence were either too small to reliably exclude an effect of the intervention, had numerous methodological limitations, or included an intervention which may not have been intense enough to produce the required changes in exercise levels. There is insufficient evidence to recommend exercise as a specific aid to smoking cessation. There is strong evidence to recommend exercise as an aid for reducing tobacco withdrawal and cravings, and further research is needed to understand how best to integrate this advice into current smoking cessation programmes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend exercise interventions for reducing smoking consumption or for increasing the numbers of smokers who make quit attempts.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-27 11:53:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials are needed with larger sample sizes, sufficiently intense exercise interventions, equal contact control conditions, and measures of exercise adherence across the sample. Further work is needed to unravel the relationship between different intensities and timings of exercise intervention, and different types of exercise, and the effect on smoking abstinence and on underlying processes such as tobacco withdrawal and cravings, particularly during actual quit attempts. Trials are needed to assess the impact of exercise programmes on attempts to quit and on smoking reduction among those who do not wish to quit immediately.</P>

<TD>
<P>At longest follow-up, one study detected a difference of borderline significance in favour of the intervention group. Another study reported significantly higher abstinence rates at six month follow-up for a combined exercise and smoking cessation programme compared with brief smoking cessation advice, but not when compared to the full smoking cessation programme. No other studies detected a significant difference between intervention and comparison groups at longest follow-up.</P>
