<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People treated with dialysis frequently experience depression and anxiety. Depression in this situation is linked to poor quality of life and increased complications, such as needing to be admitted to hospital, or stopping dialysis treatment. Patients, their families, and health care workers agree that caring for depression symptoms appropriately and finding effective treatments is really important. Antidepressant drugs may not be removed from the body as quickly for people with kidney disease and so may cause more side effects. Despite depression being very common and treatment having potentially different side-effects compared with people without kidney disease, a previous version of this review in 2005 found only a single research study. It is unknown whether antidepressant treatment works and is safe for people with kidney failure.</P>
<P>A summary of whether antidepressant therapy works and is safe in people with kidney failure would be relevant to patients and their families, health care workers, and policy makers to generate patient-centred treatment policies.</P>
<P>This review looks at whether we know whether drug treatment works to improve symptoms of depression in adults treated with dialysis without causing common and severe side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included all studies which have looked at drug treatment against placebo (sugar pill) or other kinds of mental health support. People included in the studies had an equal chance of receiving either treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even though depression is very common and finding good treatments for depression are highly valued by patients on dialysis, there are only a few small studies to tell us about whether drug treatments are both safe and reduce symptoms. Based on this information, we still don't know whether depression treatment works well for people treated with dialysis and is safe (doesn't cause excess and serious side effects).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The question of whether drugs can reduce symptoms of depression and improve quality of life for people on dialysis is still important. We need a big study that involves dialysis patients and assesses a commonly-used antidepressant drug with a placebo and measures the treatment effects based on what patients and their families value most.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:01:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Depression affects approximately one-quarter of people treated with dialysis and is considered an important research uncertainty by patients and health professionals. Treatment for depression in dialysis patients may have different benefits and harms compared to the general population due to different clearances of antidepressant medication and the severity of somatic symptoms associated with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Guidelines suggest treatment of depression in dialysis patients with pharmacological therapy, preferably a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This is an update of a review first published in 2005.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>To evaluate the benefit and harms of antidepressants for treating depression in adults with ESKD treated with dialysis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:01:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 20 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant treatment with placebo or no treatment, or compared to another antidepressant medication or psychological intervention in adults with ESKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-12-17 16:36:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Data were abstracted by two authors independently onto a standard form and subsequently entered into Review Manager. Risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Four studies in 170 participants compared antidepressant therapy (fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram) versus placebo or psychological training for 8 to 12 weeks. In generally very low or ungradeable evidence, compared to placebo, antidepressant therapy had no evidence of benefit on quality of life, had uncertain effects on increasing the risk of hypotension (3 studies, 144 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.92), headache (2 studies 56 participants: RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 11.57), and sexual dysfunction (2 studies, 101 participants: RR 3.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 23.34), and increased nausea (3 studies, 114 participants: RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.68). There were few or no data for hospitalisation, suicide or all-cause mortality resulting in inconclusive evidence. Antidepressant therapy may reduce depression scores during treatment compared to placebo (1 study, 43 participants: MD -7.50, 95% CI -11.94 to -3.06). Antidepressant therapy was not statistically different from group psychological therapy for effects on depression scores or withdrawal from treatment and a range of other outcomes were not measured.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-22 18:04:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Despite the high prevalence of depression in dialysis patients and the relative priority that patients place on effective treatments, evidence for antidepressant medication in the dialysis setting is sparse and data are generally inconclusive. The relative benefits and harms of antidepressant therapy in dialysis patients are poorly known and large randomised studies of antidepressants versus placebo are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Adults who have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) - defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m<SUP>2 </SUP>- commonly experience a heavy burden of symptoms that includes fatigue/tiredness, depression and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Murtagh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murtagh 2007</LINK>). In a recent systematic review of observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2013a</LINK>), approximately 25% of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for major depression based on a clinical interview, a prevalence that may exceed that of other settings including primary care, cancer, heart failure and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2009</LINK>). Depression associated with kidney disease is linked to poorer health outcomes including increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2013b</LINK>), worse quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsay 2002</LINK>), lower adherence to recommended dietary and fluid restrictions (<LINK REF="REF-Sensky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sensky 1996</LINK>), increased utilisation of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Abbas-Tavallaii-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbas Tavallaii 2009</LINK>), and hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Hedayati-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedayati 2005</LINK>). Health-related quality of life may correlate more strongly with depression than with measures of dialysis adequacy (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steele-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 1996</LINK>). Depressed patients treated with peritoneal dialysis have higher complication rates from peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Juergenson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juergenson 1996</LINK>), while dialysis patients are more likely to commit suicide than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Abram-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abram 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haenel-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haenel 1980</LINK>). Among older dialysis patients, rates of hospitalisation for depression as a primary diagnosis are significantly greater than among patients with ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peptic ulcer disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to prevalence and severity of depressed mood in dialysis patients, adult patients on or nearing dialysis, their caregivers and health care professionals collectively cite depression among their top 10 current research uncertainties in kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 2014</LINK>). Similarly, patients consider the psychosocial aspects of living with CKD and reducing symptoms of kidney disease as priorities to be considered within current research agendas (<LINK REF="REF-Tong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2008</LINK>), suggesting the optimal management depression is an important and unanswered question in the care of patients with ESKD.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-27 18:16:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Potential treatments for depression in adults with ESKD include psychosocial and psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, non-directive or supportive therapy and counselling). In addition, antidepressant medication may be used to treat depression including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). Clinical guidelines suggest treatment with antidepressant medication (with SSRIs as first-line) in adults with CKD who meet diagnostic criteria for depression, based on observational studies and limited evidence of harm (<LINK REF="REF-ERBP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERBP 2012</LINK>). Drug clearance of many antidepressants or their active metabolites is substantially reduced by kidney failure (selegiline, amitripylinoxide, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, milnacipran, bupropion, reboxetine) and may be altered by dialysis treatment (<LINK REF="REF-ERBP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERBP 2012</LINK>). Accordingly the balance of harm and benefit of antidepressant therapy in adults with kidney disease may be different from that of the general population.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-27 17:26:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Associations between depression and treatment adherence, hospitalisation, mortality and quality of life in the setting of kidney disease suggest adequate treatment of depressed mood has a potential role to play in improved outcomes in this clinical setting. Existing studies have shown that depression is linked to impaired nutrition in adults with advanced kidney disease and that antidepressant therapy together with psychotherapy might improve nutritional parameters in depressed patients (<LINK REF="REF-Friend-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friend 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Koo 2005</LINK>). In addition, depression is associated with inflammation in dialysis patients which has been suggested as a putative contributor to cardiovascular disease in the setting of other non-communicable diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Emerging-Risk-Factors-Collaboration-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaccarino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccarino 2007</LINK>). Depression is also linked to reduced social support, elevated social conflict and a greater likelihood of withdrawing from dialysis treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lacson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacson 2012</LINK>). Reduced adherence with medical treatment may be caused by depression and is in turn linked to poorer outcomes, suggesting an additional causal mechanism between depression and health care utilisation that might be ameliorated by effective treatment for depression (<LINK REF="REF-DiMatteo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiMatteo 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The high prevalence of depressive symptoms in adults treated with dialysis, associations with poor health outcomes, the markedly altered pharmacology of drug interventions for depression caused by kidney failure, together with the prioritisation of depression by patients as a key contemporary uncertainty in the care of people with CKD mandates the need for robust evidence synthesis of available treatments. In an earlier version of this review, current to February 2005, a single short-term study comparing fluoxetine with placebo was identified. This review aims to update the current evidence for antidepressant agents to treat depression in adults with ESKD treated with dialysis and to evaluate our confidence in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Any further information required from the original author was requested by written correspondence and any relevant information obtained was to be included in the review. Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, randomised patients as well as intention-to-treat, as-treated and per-protocol population were carefully performed.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-28 12:18:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We first assessed for statistical heterogeneity visually by inspecting forest plots of standardised mean effect sizes and of RR. Furthermore, we applied a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test to assess heterogeneity. The test has low power in general but especially when the sample size of the included studies is low or there are only a few included studies. Therefore, we used a P value of 0.10 to determine statistical significance. In addition, we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We used conventions of interpretation that were defined by Higgins (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In the case of substantial levels (50% to 90%) and considerable levels (75% to 100%) of heterogeneity, we examined data by subgroup and sensitivity analyses (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>; <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>) for different aspects of clinical and methodological heterogeneity.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-27 17:31:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In order to minimise publication bias, we made every attempt to include unpublished studies (e.g. by searching online trial registries). In order to assess for publication bias, we implemented funnel plots (effect versus standard error of the effect size) when a sufficient number of studies was available (according to recommendations of the <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> section 10 Addressing reporting biases). For the analysis and the interpretation of the funnel plots, other reasons for asymmetry besides publication bias were considered (e.g. differences in methodological quality; true heterogeneity in intervention effects).</P>

<P>We have presented the main results of the review in a 'Summary of findings' table.

The 'Summary of findings' table also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011b</LINK>).

After screening, 29 full papers were retrieved for assessment for inclusion. Twenty seven studies (28 papers) were excluded as they were not RCTs (10 studies), the interventions were not relevant to this review (14), or the populations were not ones being assessed by this review (3). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenfield-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenfield 1997</LINK>) with a total of 12 randomised patients was eligible for inclusion. This study compared fluoxetine with placebo in a subset of depressed dialysis patients. The selected patients were derived from a dialysis population who were either referred for psychiatric consultation, or were patients during one dialysis shift who were assessed for major depressive disorder by a psychiatrist. The study did not give standard deviations for the results but we were able to calculate it from the other data provided (mean and exact P values) in the paper.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In this systematic review and meta-analysis, evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant medication in adults with ESKD treated with dialysis is very sparse. Three studies have compared an SSRI with placebo involving 126 participants and a single study has compared SSRI therapy with psychological support in 44 participants. All studies were short, limited to 12 weeks or fewer and meta-analyses for all outcomes included 118 participants or fewer. We generally had very low confidence in the estimated treatment effects or effects were not estimable due to limitations in study reporting, substantial imprecision in treatment effects and small numbers of studies, limiting the applicability of the findings to the general dialysis population.</P>
<P>Compared to placebo, short-term SSRI therapy may reduce clinical depression scores in ungradeable evidence, at the expense of incurring nausea. Effects on all-cause mortality, suicide, other adverse events such as hypotension or dizziness, headache and sexual dysfunction, withdrawal from dialysis, and hospitalisation were not estimable due to insufficient data. Compared to group psychological training, SSRI therapy had no statistical effect on depression scores, and withdrawal from treatment was difficult to ascertain due to few events in the available study.</P>
<P>Overall, despite the potential prevalence of major depression in adults treated with dialysis, estimated to affect up to one-quarter of patients, and the priority patients and caregivers place on management of depression as an important clinical uncertainty, available study evidence for the safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy is currently lacking.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>While our review was based on a highly sensitive electronic search strategy and included studies from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register of studies, which includes results from handsearching and journal alerts, the paucity of existing studies evaluating pharmacological treatment of depression in the setting of dialysis patients means there are considerable evidence gaps. First, studies evaluated depression using heterogeneous methods including depression scales and interview techniques. Due to the heavy symptom burden of ESKD, depression scales in the general population may lack validity in the setting of kidney failure and falsely detect the presence of depression due to somatic symptoms associated with kidney disease, such as fatigue and anorexia. Few studies exist to validate depression tools in the context of ESKD. Our recent meta-analysis (although not specifically designed to assess diagnostic test accuracy for depression scales) suggested that depression scales are likely to over-estimate depression prevalence in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies were short in duration (12 weeks or fewer). The relative efficacy and safety of longer term antidepressant treatment is unknown. Outcome data were sparse and confidence intervals were frequently very wide, including for important adverse events including hypotension. The development of a core set of patient-prioritised outcomes for depression in adults with CKD, which are required to be reported in clinical studies would assist with building evidence for these drugs in dialysis patients as studies cumulate. Additionally, as clearance of antidepressant drugs or their metabolites is commonly impaired in ESKD, safety data for antidepressant medication are required. Notably, in this review only SSRI were studied. The effectiveness and safety of other agents, including TCA remains unknown. Information was limited to small studies conducted in the USA, Turkey and Iran and results may not be generalisable to other national settings.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-12-17 16:35:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We graded our confidence in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>), which considers study limitations, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency and publication bias. Overall, most studies had high or unclear risks of bias for most domains of study reporting assessed. Estimated effects on efficacy and safety outcomes were frequently imprecise with confidence intervals that were consistent with both considerable benefit or harm. The generalisability (directness) of the evidence was limited by a gross paucity of available studies and publication bias (the effects of small studies on treatment effects) could not be assessed. While treatment estimates showed no evidence of statistical heterogeneity, the small number of studies limited the power of statistical testing and important inconsistency between studies could not excluded. Overall, based on important limitations, we have generally very low confidence in the evidence for the benefits and harms of antidepressant therapy in dialysis patients and any estimations of effect are very uncertain.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-27 16:39:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>While this review was conducted according to a prespecified protocol and is reported using Cochrane methods, the review has limitations which should be considered when interpreting the results. First, relatively few data were available resulting in inconclusive evidence for many outcomes including mortality, suicide, hospitalisation, depression scores and adverse events. Second, while the included studies appeared similar in their treatment approaches to depression, there was insufficient power in analyses to detect any heterogeneity between differing studies. Third, adverse event data were collated ad hoc in the included studies and important adverse events may not have been captured. Finally, outcome data for patient-important outcomes were not available in most studies, which reduced our confidence in the reliability of these treatment effects. This was particularly the case for reporting of quality of life domains.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In 2012, a meta-analysis of antidepressant therapy for adults with stage 3 to 5 CKD (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>) included both randomised and non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-ERBP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERBP 2012</LINK>). In that meta-analysis, three RCTs were identified including one ongoing study in adults not treated with dialysis (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-Study-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CAST Study 2013</LINK>) and two studies in dialysis patients (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenfield-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenfield 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yazici-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yazici 2012</LINK>). In that review, insufficient outcome data were available for <LINK REF="STD-Yazici-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yazici 2012</LINK> which was an abstract only publication at the time of publication, and, similar to this review, <LINK REF="STD-Blumenfield-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenfield 1997</LINK> was adjudicated to show similar effects of fluoxetine on depression scores as placebo, with numerically higher numbers of adverse events with fluoxetine including hypotension. Based on evidence from nine additional non-randomised studies, the review authors concluded that there was evidence suggesting benefit for antidepressant therapy with commonly-experienced but mild side-effects. The review concluded that evidence for treatment for depression is currently insufficient to guide treatment and that a well-designed RCT is greatly needed. Guidelines also suggest early re-assessment of therapy to assess effectiveness and to avoid prolonged use (<LINK REF="REF-ERBP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERBP 2012</LINK>). Based on this updated Cochrane review, our findings are consistent with the need to evaluate antidepressant treatment in dialysis patients within the setting of new RCTs.</P>
<P>We note also that a relative lack of evidence for efficacy of antidepressant treatment in the setting of CKD is consistent with a broader concern about the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2008</LINK>). Given that the effects of antidepressants are modest even for people with normal kidney function, it is quite plausible that even small increases in treatment-related harm in dialysis patients might offset this small benefit, even if the efficacy of treatment is similar for dialysis patients compared to the general population.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-23 15:56:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Our main finding was that there is insufficient evidence to support prescribing of antidepressant medications in adults treated with dialysis outside of participation in RCTs. The potential for increased harm with antidepressant medication (due to impaired clearance of drugs and their metabolites) is also insufficiently evaluated by current evidence and application of research information derived from the general population may not be appropriate. Data from a few studies in this review suggests nausea may be caused by antidepressant therapy. Identification of effective treatments for depression is highly valued by patients mandating the need for further placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating both drug effectiveness and safety based on study endpoints prioritised by patients and clinicians.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-18 11:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>There is a great need for undertaking further RCTs that assess the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in patients treated with dialysis. New studies are needed to improve our confidence about the effectiveness and safety of drug treatments for depression. Studies evaluating drug therapy should be sufficiently powered to detect adverse events and patient-centred outcomes. Patient and clinician priorities for clinical endpoints should be considered in the design of future RCTs. Standardisation of study design and outcomes would facilitate prospective and collaborative meta-analysis of treatment effects. Ideally, new studies would include participants meeting diagnostic criteria for depression based on interview methods and evaluate longer term treatment and in patients with a range of depression severity including severe forms of depression. Greater understanding of the barriers to treatment implementation and the sustainability of interventions and follow up would be helpful.</P>
