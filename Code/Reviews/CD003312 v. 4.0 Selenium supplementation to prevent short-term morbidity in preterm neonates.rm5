<P>Higher doses of selenium supplements may be able to reduce some complications for preterm babies, but more research is needed. Selenium is an essential trace element gained from nutrients. Babies are born with lower selenium concentrations in their blood than their mothers. In very preterm babies, low selenium is associated with an increased risk of complications. The review of trials of selenium supplementation for preterm babies found that it reduces sepsis (blood infection). It has not been shown to reduce other complications or increase survival. No adverse effects were reported. Higher than usual levels of selenium supplementation may be beneficial, but more research is needed as most of the evidence comes from a country where selenium levels were unusually low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Selenium is an essential trace element and component of a number of selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidase, which has a role in protecting against oxidative damage. Selenium is also known to play a role in immunocompetence. Blood selenium concentrations in newborns are lower than those of their mothers and lower still in preterm infants. In experimental animals low selenium concentrations appear to increase susceptibility to oxidative lung disease. In very preterm infants low selenium concentrations have been associated with an increased risk of chronic neonatal lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:34:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three eligible trials were identified. Two trials, including one trial with a much larger sample size than the others combined, were from geographical areas with low population selenium concentrations. Meta-analysis of the pooled data showed a significant reduction in the proportion of infants having one or more episodes of sepsis associated with selenium supplementation [summary RR 0.73 (0.57 to 0.93); RD -0.10 (-0.17 to -0.02); NNT 10 (5.9 to 50)]. Supplementation with selenium was not associated with improved survival, a reduction in neonatal chronic lung disease or retinopathy of prematurity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Supplementing very preterm infants with selenium is associated with benefit in terms of a reduction in one or more episodes of sepsis. Supplementation was not associated with improved survival, a reduction in neonatal chronic lung disease or retinopathy of prematurity. Supplemental doses of selenium for infants on parenteral nutrition higher than those currently recommended may be beneficial. The data are dominated by one large trial from a country with low selenium concentrations and may not be readily translated to other populations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-07 14:15:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-07 14:15:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trace element selenium is an essential component of a number of selenoproteins. These include the glutathione peroxidases (a family of enzymes that protect against oxidative injury by catalysing the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides); iodothyronine deiodinase (which converts thyroxine [T4] to 3,5,3'-triodothyronine [T3]); and thioredoxin reductase (which is a key enzyme regulating the redox state of cells), (<LINK REF="REF-Arthur-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2000</LINK>). Selenium is also known to have a role in immunocompetence, selenium deficiency being associated with impairment of both cell-mediated immunity and B-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-01-07 14:15:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The consequences of low selenium concentrations are not fully known. A range of selenium deficiency diseases have been described in animals and in some selenium deficient geographical areas, such as New Zealand, selenium supplements are essential for maintaining animal health. During the late 1970s reports from endemically selenium deficient areas of China described two human diseases associated with severe nutritional selenium deficiency. However, both Keshan disease, a juvenile cardiomyopathy, and Kaschin-Beck disease, a chondrodystrophy, seem to require other causative co-factors in addition to selenium deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Litov-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litov 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2000</LINK>). Outside of China, selenium deficiency diseases have been rarely recognised and then only following exceptional circumstances such as prolonged parenteral nutrition or severe malnutrition when selenium concentrations fall to &lt; 0.20 micromol/L (16 micrograms/L). Clinical features have included muscle pain and tenderness, macrocytosis and pigmentary changes in hair and nails, and fatal cardiomyopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Litov-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litov 1991</LINK>). The only reported adverse effect of low selenium levels in preterm infants has been increased erythrocyte fragility, which was accentuated by a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and by iron supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Selenium levels in the soil vary considerably in different geographical locations with blood selenium concentrations in both animal and human populations reflecting these variations. Plasma selenium concentrations in newborn infants in all regions of the world are lower than those of their mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Litov-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litov 1991</LINK>) and, in breast fed infants, then rise after birth. Preterm infants are born with slightly lower selenium and glutathione peroxidase concentrations than term infants, have low hepatic stores of selenium and, particularly if fed parenterally with solutions lacking selenium, these concentrations decline further in the first months of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lokitch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lokitch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sluis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sluis 1992</LINK>). In some preterm infants selenium concentrations may fall as low as 0.13 micromol/L (10 micrograms/L) and are amongst the lowest recorded in humans.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-07 14:04:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In experimental animals, selenium deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hawker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawker 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1991</LINK>). Sick very preterm infants are exposed to many possible sources of oxygen radical products, including high concentrations of inspired oxygen, frequent alterations of blood flow to major organs, and inflammation with accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages. Low blood selenium concentrations in preterm infants have therefore been suggested as a potential risk factor for chronic neonatal lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Amin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amin 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lokitch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lokitch 1989</LINK>) and retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-DeVoe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeVoe 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kretzer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kretzer 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Darlow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darlow 1995</LINK> in a study from New Zealand, which has low soil and population selenium concentrations, reported that low selenium concentrations at 28 days were associated with an increased risk of adverse respiratory outcome in very low birthweight infants. However, uncertainty exists as to whether selenium supplementation in preterm infants will prevent such morbidity.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-07 14:08:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed &#8220;partial&#8221; was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

The report by Daniels 1996 gives in full data published in abstract form in Daniels 1995, and the report by Darlow 2000 gives in full data published in abstract form in Darlow 1998. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bogye-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Bogye 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogye-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Bogye 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrenkranz--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenkranz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolph-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolph 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrala-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrala 1996</LINK>) were excluded from the final analysis because of inadequate methodology and/or because no clinical outcome data were reported. Data on selenium concentrations have not been reported in a manner allowing comparisons between studies and meta-analysis of these data have not been included in this version of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The three included studies reported outcomes on 297 infants receiving selenium supplements and 290 control infants. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK>) was much the largest and included 85% of all infants. This study was a multicentre study involving 8 New Zealand neonatal units and included infants with birthweight &lt;1500g admitted to a participating unit by 72 hours of age and without major abnormalities. Five hundred and thirty-four infants were randomised but five infants were withdrawn from the study, three by parents and two by the neonatal team caring for the infants and no data are available for these infants. <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> included infants with birthweight &lt;2000g, who were expected to have parenteral nutrition for more than 5 days and no major congenital anomalies, liver or renal disease. Forty-four infants were enrolled but six excluded, including two who died (day 3 and day 11), three who received parenteral nutrition for less than 6 days and one because of protocol violations. Data, including group assignment, are not available for these infants. in addition, two further infants died before hospital discharge and again group assignment for these infants is not available. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK> included infants with birthweight &lt;1000g with no congenital, metabolic or chronic white blood cell disease.</P>

<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> gave 3 micrograms/Kg/d selenious acid in parenteral nutrition, and received for a mean 18 days, in the treatment group versus nothing in controls. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> gave 7 micrograms/Kg/d of sodium selenate added to parenteral nutrition in the treatment group versus nothing in controls, and 5 micrograms/Kg/d of sodium selenite in the treatment group or an equivalent volume of sterile water for control infants, when fed orally until 28 days of age. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK> gave 1.5 micrograms/Kg/d of selenious acid added to parenteral nutrition, and received for a mean 38 days, in the treatment group versus nothing in controls.</P>
<P>Outcome measures<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> reported CLD (an oxygen requirement plus chest Xray changes) at 28 days, and one or more episodes of sepsis (defined as microbiologically confirmed or requiring antibiotics for at least five days). <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> reported deaths pre-hospital discharge, CLD (an oxygen requirement) at 28 days and at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, any ROP in infants who were examined (ROP screening in New Zealand being routinely carried out in infants &lt;31 weeks gestation or &lt;1250g birthweight), and one or more episodes of sepsis (defined as clinical sepsis and a positive culture from either blood or cerebrospinal fluid) after the first week of life. <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK> reported CLD at a mean 35 weeks post-menstrual age, any ROP, and one or more episodes of sepsis (not defined further).</P>

<BR/>Data on selenium concentrations have not been reported in a similar manner across the studies and do not allow a meta-analysis to be performed. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK>, which used the lowest dose of selenium supplementation added to parenteral nutrition (1.5 micrograms/Kg/d), found supplemented infants had significantly higher serum concentrations when oral feeds were commenced (mean day 14 to 15) than control infants, although these concentrations were below pre-randomisation concentrations. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> used a dose of 3 micrograms/Kg/d added to parenteral nutrition and found plasma selenium concentrations fell compared with pre-randomisation concentrations by three weeks of age in control infants, whilst this decline was prevented by supplementation. By six weeks of age there was no significant difference between the groups with selenium concentrations in both being similar to pre-randomisation concentrations. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> supplemented parenteral nutrition with 7 micrograms/Kg/d and enteral feeding with 5 micrograms/Kg/d of selenium. Supplemented infants had plasma selenium concentrations significantly higher (nearly two-fold) at 28 days and 36 weeks post-menstrual age than pre-randomisation concentrations and these were similar to concentrations found in healthy breast-fed term infants in this population. By contrast, selenium concentrations in control infants showed a non-significant fall at these times compared with pre-randomisation concentrations. Plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations were also significantly higher at 28 days and 36 weeks post-menstrual age compared with control infants and with pre-randomisation concentrations.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> included 243 infants with birthweight &lt; 1000 g and noted that confining analysis to this subgroup of infants did not reveal significant differences between the groups with respect to primary or secondary outcomes, however the data have not been reported.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> was a large, multicentre randomised controlled trial with 80% power to detect a 12% reduction in oxygen dependency at 28 days. However, neither this study nor pooled data from this study and one of two smaller studies reporting similar outcomes showed any benefit from selenium supplementation with respect to deaths prior to discharge, oxygen use in survivors at 28 days or at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, or retinopathy of prematurity of any stage, with relative risks for all analyses being close to unity. </P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> reported that lower plasma selenium concentrations before randomisation were associated with an increased risk of adverse respiratory outcome at 28 days and a trend to increased risk of adverse outcome at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, after controlling for gestational age, antenatal steroids, CRIB score and hospital. There was a similar association between maternal selenium concentrations at enrolment and neonatal outcome. The relationship between pre-randomisation infant selenium concentrations and total days in oxygen was non-linear with a threshold of between 0.2 and 0.4 micromols/L below which, in this population, selenium concentrations had an effect on days of oxygen requirement. These findings suggest that if oxidative damage contributes to respiratory morbidity in preterm infants, and selenium has a role in preventing or ameliorating such damage, that it may be critical to achieve improved selenium status earlier than was the case in the studies included in this review. Low selenium concentrations at birth reflect low body stores (<LINK REF="REF-Bayliss-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayliss 1985</LINK>) and also correlate with maternal concentrations. At least in populations with low selenium status, the role of maternal selenium supplementation from perhaps 20 weeks' gestation could be the subject of further study, although given that very preterm infants constitute only around 1% of births, large numbers of pregnant women (at least 5,000) would have to be recruited.</P>
<P>Two of the studies in this review come from geographical areas recognised as having low soil and population concentrations of selenium. There are good theoretical reasons to expect that, if selenium supplementation does result in decreased morbidity, this would be more readily apparent in studies from populations with low selenium concentrations. Nevertheless, the fact that the one large study is from such a population and that no large trials have been carried out in populations with higher concentrations, does mean that the results may not be generalisable. </P>
<P>The mean pre-randomisation plasma selenium concentrations in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> (South Australia) were 0.34 and 0.36 micromols/L, in the study and control groups respectively, and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> (New Zealand) were 0.33 micromols/L in both groups. In contrast the mean pre-randomisation serum selenium concentrations in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK> (Portland, Oregan) were 0.91 and 0.81 micromols/L in the study and control groups. Preterm infants generally have lower selenium concentrations than term infants in the same population, and in healthy term breast-fed infants concentrations then rise after birth. North American recommendations are for preterm infants to be supplemented with 2 micrograms/Kg/d selenium whilst receiving parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Reifen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reifen 1993</LINK>). The data from <LINK REF="STD-Huston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huston 1991</LINK> show that a slightly lower dose (1.5 micrograms/Kg/d) resulted in serum concentrations still below starting concentrations after two weeks. In another study from North America, <LINK REF="REF-Ormsby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormsby 1998</LINK>, reported that a dose of 4 micrograms/Kg/d added to parenteral nutrition for an average of more than three weeks did not maintain day one plasma selenium concentrations in preterm infants. Taken together, the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> suggest that 3 micrograms/Kg/d selenium supplementation in preterm infants may maintain cord concentrations but supplementation of 5-7 micrograms/Kg/d may be required to raise concentrations above those in cord blood to close to those found in healthy breast-fed term infants. Additional factors that may influence selenium concentrations in preterm infants include the form of selenium supplementation, route of administration and interactions with other nutrients, and the selenium content of enteral feeds.</P>
<P>Two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK>, as well as the pooled data showed a significant reduction in one or more episodes of sepsis associated with selenium supplementation, with the number needed to treat to prevent sepsis in one infant being 10. Selenium is known to have a role in immunocompetence (<LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2000</LINK>). Neutrophils and macrophages from selenium deficient animals have low glutathione peroxidase concentrations, which may affect their antimicrobial properties, and animal studies have also shown that immunoglobulin antibody responses may be enhanced by selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1991</LINK>). The relationship between selenium status and infections in preterm infants in different populations and the role of selenium supplementation is an important area for further research. </P>
<P>Limitations of this review.<BR/>Two included studies did not report outcome for all participants. <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 1996</LINK> did not report any data, including group assignment, for six infants, two of whom died. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> examination for retinopathy of prematurity followed national guidelines (&lt;31 weeks gestation or &lt;1250g birthweight as a routine) and hence not all surviving infants were examined. <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 2000</LINK> also defined sepsis as episodes after the first week of life.</P>
<P>Two of the studies in this review, one of which accounts for 85% of participants, come from geographical areas recognised as having low soil and population concentrations of selenium. There are good theoretical reasons to expect that, if selenium supplementation does result in decreased morbidity, this would be more readily apparent in studies from populations with low selenium concentrations. Nevertheless, the fact that the one large study is from such a population and that no large trials have been carried out in populations with higher concentrations, does mean that the results may not be generalisable. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Supplementing very preterm infants with selenium is associated with benefit in terms of a reduction in one or more episodes of late-onset sepsis. Supplementation was not associated with improved survival, a reduction in neonatal chronic lung disease or retinopathy of prematurity. The data would suggest that the currently recommended dose of selenium for preterm infants receiving parenteral nutrition, 2 micrograms/Kg/d, is inadequate to maintain cord selenium concentrations, whilst doses of 3 micrograms/Kg/d may prevent a decline in cord levels and doses of up to 7 micrograms/Kg/d may be required to achieve concentrations above those in cords and close to concentrations found in healthy breast fed infants. These latter data come from New Zealand, a country with low soil and population selenium concentrations, and may not be readily translated to other populations. Beyond the reduction in late-onset sepsis, the benefits of selenium supplementation remain more theoretical than proven. However, the decline in selenium concentrations seen in non-supplemented very preterm infants is not physiological and, given that selenium is recognised as an essential trace element, should be avoided. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The impact of maternal selenium supplementation from 20 weeks gestation on the outcome for very preterm infants deserves investigation, although given that very preterm infants constitute only around 1% of births, large numbers of pregnant women would have to be recruited.</P>
<P>Further studies are warranted on the relationship between selenium status and infections in preterm infants.</P>
