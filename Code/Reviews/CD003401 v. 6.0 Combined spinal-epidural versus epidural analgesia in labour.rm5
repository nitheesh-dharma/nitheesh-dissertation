<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-23 13:37:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regional analgesia has been shown to be effective in providing pain relief in labour. Regional analgesia can be an epidural, a spinal or a combination of the two. An epidural is when the pain-relieving drugs are injected into the part of the body which surrounds the spinal column (epidural space). It is most common for these drugs to be infused through a very fine tube (catheter) positioned in the epidural space. Traditionally, high concentrations of local anaesthetic drugs were used. These numbed the woman from the waist downwards giving pain relief for most women. However, it also caused leg weakness, poor mobility and difficulty for the mother giving birth. This led to increased instrumental vaginal births with subsequent increased bruising, pain and incontinence later on for the mother. More recently with epidurals, low-dose local anaesthetic drugs have been used in combination with opioid drugs. Here there is less numbing of the woman's legs but the opioid drugs cross the placenta and may make the baby sleepy.</P>
<P>A spinal is when the analgesic drugs are injected directly into the fluid surrounding the nerves in the spinal column and is quicker to take effect than an epidural. However, because a single spinal injection is only effective for a short period of time, they are not commonly used on their own for pain relief in labour. Also, the use of very fine catheters in the spinal space has been associated with increased injury to nerves. Hence, the combination of a single spinal injection combined with the use of an epidural catheter for ongoing pain relief was developed. This combined spinal-epidural was thought to have the benefits of being quicker to provide pain relief but with no change to the incidence or severity of side effects for the mother or baby.</P>
<P>This review of trials compared CSE with traditional and with low-dose epidurals. There were 27 trials, involving 3274 women. The data showed no difference in the mothers' satisfaction between CSE and epidurals. However, CSEs had a slightly faster onset of effective pain relief, but more women itched than with low-dose epidurals. There was no difference seen for mobility in labour, headaches, caesarean section or adverse effects for the baby. Any differences for rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis remain unknown. There appears to be little difference overall between these techniques.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-23 13:32:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional epidural techniques have been associated with prolonged labour, use of oxytocin augmentation and increased incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery. The combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique has been introduced in an attempt to reduce these adverse effects. CSE is believed to improve maternal mobility during labour and provide more rapid onset of analgesia than epidural analgesia, which could contribute to increased maternal satisfaction.</P>

<P>Twenty-seven trials involving 3274 women met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-six outcomes in two sets of comparisons involving CSE versus traditional epidurals and CSE versus low-dose epidural techniques were analysed.</P>
<P>Of the CSE versus traditional epidural analyses five outcomes showed a significant difference. CSE was more favourable in relation to speed of onset of analgesia from time of injection (mean difference (MD) -2.87 minutes; 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to -0.67; two trials, 129 women); the need for rescue analgesia (risk ratio (RR) 0.31; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.70; one trial, 42 women); urinary retention (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; one trial, 704 women); and rate of instrumental delivery (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; six trials, 1015 women). Traditional epidural was more favourable in relation to umbilical venous pH (MD -0.03; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.00; one trial, 55 women). There were no data on maternal satisfaction, blood patch for post dural puncture headache, respiratory depression, umbilical cord pH, rare neurological complications, analgesia for caesarean section after analgesic intervention or any economic/use of resources outcomes for this comparison. No differences between CSE and traditional epidural were identified for mobilisation in labour, the need for labour augmentation, the rate of caesarean birth, incidence of post dural puncture headache, maternal hypotension, neonatal Apgar scores or umbilical arterial pH.</P>
<P>For CSE versus low-dose epidurals, three outcomes were statistically significant. Two of these reflected a faster onset of effective analgesia from time of injection with CSE and the third was of more pruritus with CSE compared to low-dose epidural (average RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.65; 11 trials, 959 women; random-effects, T² = 0.26, I² = 84%). There was no significant difference in maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05; seven trials, 520 women; random-effects, T² = 0.00, I² = 45%). There were no data on respiratory depression, maternal sedation or the need for labour augmentation. No differences between CSE and low-dose epidural were identified for need for rescue analgesia, mobilisation in labour, incidence of post dural puncture headache, known dural tap, blood patch for post dural headache, urinary retention, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, headache, the need for labour augmentation, mode of delivery, umbilical pH, Apgar score or admissions to the neonatal unit.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-23 13:32:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be little basis for offering CSE over epidurals in labour, with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with CSE and conversely less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. There was no difference in ability to mobilise, maternal hypotension, rate of caesarean birth or neonatal outcome. However, the significantly higher incidence of urinary retention, rescue interventions and instrumental deliveries with traditional techniques would favour the use of low-dose epidurals. It is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-06 10:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews examining pain management in labour. These reviews contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain management for women in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epidural analgesia has been shown to be the most effective method of providing pain relief in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 1999</LINK>) when compared with non-epidural methods (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2001</LINK>). On a national level, an epidural technique is used for pain relief in approximately 25% of labouring women in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Khor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khor 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOAD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOAD 2004</LINK>) and in as many as 58% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Declercq-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declercq 2002</LINK>). Administration of regional analgesia traditionally involves an injection of local anaesthetic through a catheter positioned in the epidural space. Epidural solutions are administered either by bolus or infusion which permits analgesia to be maintained throughout labour. Bolus administration may be at the discretion of the woman in labour in which case it is referred to as patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). In addition, a functioning epidural catheter usually gives the option of providing regional anaesthesia for obstetric interventions such as forceps delivery or caesarean section, thus avoiding the risks of general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional epidural techniques, employing high concentrations of local anaesthetic (at least 0.25% bupivacaine), have been associated with prolonged labour, use of oxytocin augmentation and an increased incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>). This is probably secondary to a dense motor block which results in leg weakness, poor mobility, decreased pelvic muscle tone and an impaired bearing-down reflex during the delivery of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2001</LINK>). Newer regional techniques for labour analgesia use a low concentration of local anaesthetic often in combination with an opioid. This low-dose combination appears to provide the excellent analgesia of higher concentrations of epidural local anaesthetics (<LINK REF="REF-Akerman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akerman 1988</LINK>) while maintaining motor function. The mother is therefore more likely to have the ability to walk during her labour or deliver without assistance (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combined spinal-epidural involves an injection of an analgesic or local anaesthetic drug, or both, into the intrathecal space immediately before or after epidural catheter placement. A number of variations in the technique have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>) but typically an epidural needle is first used to identify the epidural space (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. A smaller diameter, longer needle is then passed through the epidural needle lumen piercing the dura and arachnoid to allow administration of analgesic medications (e.g. opioids) into the cerebrospinal fluid. The spinal needle is then removed and an epidural catheter is inserted and secured in the normal way. Further analgesia usually in the form of a low-dose local anaesthetic solution combined with an opioid is then provided through the epidural catheter. Both epidural and spinal drugs are believed to access sites of action within the spinal cord and the peripheral nerve roots (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 1998</LINK>), which supply the uterus. Spinal analgesia is not usually used as the sole technique for pain relief in labour because of its relatively short duration. The insertion and use of spinal micro-catheters has previously been associated with a higher risk of permanent neurological damage (<LINK REF="REF-Rigler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigler 1991</LINK>) and this technique is not in widespread use. CSE is claimed to combine the advantages of both epidural and spinal techniques including: faster onset, more reliable analgesia (due to the spinal component), minimal motor and sensory blockade, improved mobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Collis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawal-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawal 1997a</LINK>), lower maternal and cord blood local anaesthetic concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>), and higher patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Collis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collis 1994</LINK>). Since its introduction, CSE has become increasingly popular (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1999</LINK>) and is used routinely at many institutions for obstetric analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Collis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawal 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although all regional techniques can provide effective pain relief, this needs to be balanced with the risk of potential adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bromage-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromage 1999</LINK>). Complications common to both CSE and epidural analgesic techniques include failure to provide satisfactory pain relief, maternal hypotension, post dural puncture headache (PDPH) (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 2009</LINK>), urinary retention, itching and transient backache over the injection site. Rare serious complications include meningitis, compression of the spinal cord from a blood clot or abscess and damage to nerve roots causing paraesthesia or weakness. In addition, inadvertent administration of an epidural dose of local anaesthetic intravenously or intrathecally can result in convulsions or total spinal anaesthesia respectively, requiring resuscitation and urgent delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Rawal-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawal 1997a</LINK>). The use of two needles in CSE, one epidural and one spinal, may increase the potential for disruption of the protective dural barrier with an associated increase in maternal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 1999</LINK>). Modern spinal needles are designed to minimise the incidence of PDPH (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2005</LINK>), which is approximately 1.5% to 2%. Epidural needles are not designed to enter the intrathecal space and if they do so accidentally, which occurs in approximately 1.5% of women, they are associated with an approximately 50% chance of developing a PDPH (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 2009</LINK>). This complication can sometimes be disabling (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 2000</LINK>). If the headache fails to resolve spontaneously an epidural blood patch is a common form of treatment which has been shown to be more effective than conservative management (<LINK REF="REF-Boonmak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boonmak 2010</LINK>), providing complete relief of headache at seven days in over 80% of women (<LINK REF="REF-van-Kooten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kooten 2007</LINK>). Although a high block may occur with spinal or epidural anaesthesia alone, CSE may increase the risk of this complication (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2001</LINK>), which can lead to maternal hypotension, respiratory arrest or loss of consciousness. Neonatal effects such as fetal bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1996</LINK>) or the need for resuscitation have been associated with the use of both CSE and epidural techniques (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>). Differences in the management of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2000</LINK>) as well as differences in CSE and epidural techniques (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>) themselves may affect the need for other interventions during labour or delivery.</P>

<P>We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful we did not combine trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity between trials with respect to the drug combinations used, both intrathecally and epidurally, the timing of subsequent dosing after initial analgesia and the method of epidural drug delivery. In the context of categorising the epidural drug dose/concentration used, the term traditional was used for trials where the epidural local anaesthetic (LA) concentration was the equivalent of bupivacaine 0.25% or more; lower concentrations were defined as low-dose. In the CSE groups, there were three types of interventions; LA plus opioid, opioid alone or null CSE where there was a dural puncture with no intrathecal injection of drugs. Using these definitions the comparisons fell into six categories as detailed below:</P>

<P>There were eight trials that included a traditional epidural group (<LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>) involved comparisons of a CSE group with both traditional and a low-dose epidural group (<I>see</I> below) and so contributed an additional 704 women to category (1) above and 701 women to category (2). With the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>), all studies fulfilling this criterion used 0.25% bupivacaine boluses at some time, with volumes ranging from 6 to 12 mL; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK> used 2% lignocaine to a total volume of 10 mL. In the three trials with a LA plus opioid group, the CSE technique involved an intrathecal injection of bupivacaine 2.5 mg in combination with either fentanyl (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>) or sufentanil (<LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>). Of the four trials with an opioid only CSE group, <LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK> used a combination of fentanyl 25 µg plus morphine 0.25 mg intrathecally, while <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK> used sufentanil 10 µg; the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>) used 25 µg of fentanyl only. Whilst the techniques of drug dosing varied between studies, it was noted in these trials that there were essentially two approaches to subsequent epidural management in the CSE groups, either using effectively the same total epidural drug administration as in the epidural group (<LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>) or using less (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>) involved the use of a low-dose infusion down the epidural catheter for maintenance. In these studies the infusions were started immediately after the initial bolus in the epidural groups. In three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>) maintenance was with intermittent epidural boluses at patient request. <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK> used 0.25% bupivacaine in the epidural group but bupivacaine 0.15% plus fentanyl 2 µg/mL in the CSE group; both <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK> used 0.25% bupivacaine in both. In the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>) in which no intrathecal drugs were injected as part of the CSE technique, all women received the same epidural management. This was also the only trial in this category which employed a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) technique for maintenance of analgesia. This involved bupivacaine 0.11% plus fentanyl 2 µg/mL at 10 mL/hour with 5 mL bolus and lockout of 10 minutes.</P>
<P>There were 16 included studies that employed a low-dose LA epidural group compared with CSE. In these trials there was a range of techniques used to establish the epidural block in the epidural groups. All employed bupivacaine as the local anaesthetic in concentrations from 0.0625% to 0.125% and in combination with fentanyl (20 to 75 µg) or sufentanil (5 to 10 µg) to a total volume of between 10 and 20 mL. Seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abrao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abrao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Medina-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Medina 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Velde-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Velde 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK>) used bupivacaine 0.125% with added fentanyl or sufentanil.

In relation to the CSE groups, in all except one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK>), the initial intrathecal injection consisted of LA plus opioid using bupivacaine and either sufentanil or fentanyl. In the <LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK> trial the CSE group consisted of intrathecal morphine 0.2 mg alone and in <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2006</LINK>, 5 µg of sufentanil and 2 mg of ropivacaine was used. For the other studies the doses employed ranged from 1.25 to 3.75 mg bupivacaine, 5 to 25 µg fentanyl and 1.5 to 5 µg sufentanil. A common technique used in six studies was that of bupivacaine 2.5 mg plus fentanyl 25 µg. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nickells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nickells 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patel-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2003a</LINK>) there was no maintenance analgesia stated. In two of the remaining studies intermittent boluses of either 0.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Nickells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nickells 2000</LINK>) or 0.125% (<LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>) bupivacaine were delivered down the indwelling epidural catheter for maintenance after return of pain.

Data from this group were independently compared with the traditional epidural group. Five studies used a PCEA technique for maintenance of analgesia. One (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Velde-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Velde 1999</LINK>) used boluses of 4 mL 0.125% bupivacaine with sufentanil 0.75 µg/mL and epinephrine 1.25 µg/mL and a lockout time of 15 minutes. The second (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>) used 10 mL 0.1% bupivacaine with added fentanyl 2 µg/mL delivered with a lockout time of 30 minutes. <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK> used bupivacaine 0.125% plus sufentanil 0.25 µg/mL with a 4 mL bolus and 10 minute lockout. <LINK REF="STD-Sezer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sezer 2007</LINK> used PCEA with 5 mL bolus of bupivacaine 0.1% plus fentanyl 2 µg/mL with a 10 minutes lockout. <LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK> used bupivacaine 0.0625% plus fentanyl 2 µg/mL at a rate of 8 to 12 mL/hr to maintain T10 block via PCEA pump.

In each case the opioid bolus was only administered after a test dose of 3 mL lignocaine 1.5%. The intrathecal component of the CSE in both trials was sufentanil 10 µg; there was no stated analgesia maintenance in either study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Maternal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No study reported time taken from request of maternal analgesia to the time the mother felt the level of pain relief was satisfactory. However, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hepner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 2000</LINK>) commented on the need to take into account the additional time required to prepare certain solutions and the impact this may have on the time from patient request to establishing analgesia. We also evaluated onset of pain relief from time of initial injection, acknowledging that this result comes more from the practical realities of conducting a research trial rather than what may be of interest to consumers. The stated primary outcome of 18 of the included studies was related to the quality of analgesia and data on analgesic efficacy were presented as a secondary outcome in a further eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Breen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skupski-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skupski 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>).

<P>All but 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abrao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abrao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Medina-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Medina 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patel-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skupski-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skupski 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>) quoted figures for degree of motor blockade, but only data from papers quoting numbers of women who actually walked during labour were used in the analysis of ability to mobilise (<LINK REF="STD-Breen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Breen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collis 1995</LINK>) only women receiving the CSE technique were assessed for motor block and if able to straight-leg-raise satisfactorily, they were encouraged to mobilise. However, the women receiving the traditional epidural analgesia were not assessed and not encouraged to walk. One other study (<LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1997</LINK>) involved two CSE groups, identical in all other respects except that the women in one group were actively encouraged to walk while those in the second CSE group were discouraged from mobilising. No data on mobility were presented for the women in the epidural group. As there was an actively promoted difference in treatment between epidural and CSE groups in both studies, this cast doubt on the maintenance of blinding, suggesting the possibility of performance bias and a loss of the benefit of randomisation. Sensitivity analysis was performed and both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Collis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1997</LINK>) were excluded. Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK> only women in the low-dose infusion and CSE groups were allowed to mobilise, with no data from the traditional epidural group for comparison. In <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK> all women in both groups were able to mobilise.</P>
<P>The incidence of short-term side effects and complications, along with maternal and neonatal effects was also presented in most studies. Maternal satisfaction with analgesia was the primary outcome for one excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Collis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collis 1995</LINK>) but measurement of satisfaction postdelivery featured as a secondary outcome in seven of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Velde-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Velde 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). Typically, the assessment of satisfaction was very simple. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK> used a four-point Likert scale response to the written question, 'Were you satisfied with your labour?'. <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK> presented satisfaction data as visual analogue scale scores at time of delivery but these could not be included in the data tables. Incidence of headache in the days following delivery was quoted widely, and the use of blood patch for post dural puncture headache was analysed from eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). One study quoted dural tap rate but not rate of headache or blood patch requirement (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>). One excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Finegold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Finegold 2003</LINK>) investigated uterine contraction rates and endogenous oxytocin levels as primary outcomes but these were not included in our measures.</P>
<P>The effect on the progress of labour was the main outcome in four studies, two assessing the rate of cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>) and two focusing on mode of delivery (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). Other side effects analysed included the occurrence of hypotension, respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and sedation. Data concerning longer-term outcomes were presented in only one (<LINK REF="STD-Medina-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Medina 1994</LINK>) of the trials although another (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>) explicitly referred to the collection of such data not yet completed. Of note, no study looked at the economics and use of resources involved in the provision of both analgesic regimens, such as comparative cost of consumables, duration and cost of stay in hospital, or need for readmission or follow-up after discharge. The effect on the progress of labour was the main outcome in four studies, three assessing the rate of cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sezer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>) and one focusing on mode of delivery (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>).</P>

In the remaining eight included studies, four quoted numbers of neonates with Apgar scores of less than seven at five minutes, while four others gave data on those scoring less than eight (<LINK REF="STD-Abouleish-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abouleish 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1998</LINK>).

These data were presented as mean pH +/- SD, rather than the number of neonates demonstrating a predefined degree of acidosis. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>) included data on the number of neonates requiring admission to a special care neonatal unit.

<P>Twenty-seven trials, involving 3274 labouring women, met our criteria for inclusion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We performed analyses on all included studies against 26 outcomes. This was performed as two separate sets of comparisons. The first set involved all combined spinal-epidural (CSE) variants versus traditional epidurals and the second set was all CSE forms versus low-dose epidurals and variants. For a summary of analyses <I>see</I> <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CSE versus traditional epidural</HEADING>
<P>Of the CSE versus traditional epidural analyses four outcomes showed a significant difference. The time from first injection to effective analgesia was less with CSE (mean difference (MD) -2.87 minutes; 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to -0.67; 129 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)) based on two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>). There was a reduced need for rescue analgesia for CSE based on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>) with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.70; 42 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>)). CSE was also more favourable with respect to the need for instrumental delivery with RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; 1015 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>)) based on six studies (<LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngamprasertwong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ngamprasertwong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tsen 1999</LINK>). CSE was also associated with less urinary retention based on the <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK> study (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; one study, 704 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>)). CSE was associated with a slightly lower umbilical venous pH in comparison to the epidural group, although this result was based on only one study involving morphine and fentanyl for the initial intrathecal injection (<LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 1994</LINK>), and statistical significance was borderline (MD -0.03; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.00; one study, 55 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>)).</P>
<P>No differences between CSE and epidural were seen for the number of women who mobilised, post dural puncture headache, pruritis, nausea and vomiting, hypotension or the rate of caesarean birth. Also, there were no significant differences for the following neonatal outcomes: umbilical arterial pH, Apgar score less than seven or less than eight at five minutes and the number of admissions to the neonatal unit.</P>
<P>Due to results not being statistically significant or outcomes reported with zero data, it was not possible to draw any conclusions with respect to the following outcomes: number of women with effective analgesia in the first 10 minutes after injection, number of women satisfied with analgesia, number of women requiring a blood patch, maternal respiratory depression and umbilical cord pH.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>No subgroup differences between opioid CSE and CSE were observed: known dural tap (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>); pruritus (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>); nausea/vomiting (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>); hypotension (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); labour augmentation required (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>); normal delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>); instrumental delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>) or caesarean section (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CSE versus low-dose epidural</HEADING>
<P>For the analyses of CSE versus low-dose epidurals and variants there were three outcomes which were statistically significant. Both measures of speed of onset of analgesia from the time of injection indicated a faster onset for CSE versus low-dose epidural. The mean time of onset of effective analgesia was -5.42 minutes (95% CI -7.26 to -3.59; five studies, 461 women; random-effects,T² = 3.27, I² = 77% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>)), while the risk ratio of effective analgesia at 10 minutes was 1.94 in favour of CSE (95% CI 1.49 to 2.54) based on a single study with 101 women (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Time of onset of effective analgesia showed substantial heterogeneity, but this would be expected given the variation in techniques between studies. However, as has been remarked upon in previous versions of this review, no study reported our primary outcome of interest with regards to time of onset of pain relief in labour from the time of patient request.</P>
<P>For the analyses of CSE versus low-dose epidurals, CSE was associated with more pruritus (average RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.65; 11 studies, 959 women; random-effects, T² = 0.26, I² = 84% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>)). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies reflecting once again the marked variability in definitions used.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between CSE and low-dose epidural with regard to modes of delivery and the need for labour augmentation. There was also no significant difference between CSE and low-dose epidurals with respect to the maternal side effects of urinary retention, nausea and vomiting, post dural puncture headache, known dural tap and need for a blood patch, or for the need of rescue analgesia. Maternal satisfaction with analgesia was also not significantly different based on seven studies (520 women) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in this result and this probably reflects the wide variation in and perhaps simplistic methods generally used for assessing this important outcome.</P>
<P>In relation to all of the neonatal outcomes there was also no difference with umbilical venous pH, umbilical cord pH, Apgar scores at five minutes and the number of neonates requiring neonatal unit admission. It was not possible to draw any conclusions with respect to the following outcomes: maternal respiratory depression and maternal sedation. No women experienced maternal respiratory depression in the studies that reported on this outcome and maternal sedation was not a reported outcome in the included studies. Two other outcomes are worth highlighting specifically. Firstly, mobilisation in labour was reported by seven studies (involving 1200 participants) and there was no difference between the techniques. Secondly, the occurrence of hypotension exhibited substantial heterogeneity, again as a result of the diverse range of definitions used. We have reported this outcome as not significant. However we conducted both subgroup and sensitivity analyses as a result of the wide variation of results seen between different studies and a funnel plot looking for any effects of small studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The small number of subjects in the different subgroups resulted in there being no discernible effect. However, within the local anaesthetic plus opioid CSE versus low-dose epidural comparison there appears to be a trend to there being a more favourable outcome for epidural over CSE; a fixed-effect analysis would produce a significant result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>We included the incidence of longer-term sequelae (e.g. neurological) as an outcome measure as this has been raised as a source of concern in the past regarding the routine use of CSE analgesia for labour. In <LINK REF="STD-Medina-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Medina 1994</LINK>, in the CSE group there was one case of reflex sympathetic pain of the foot which required two paravertebral blocks to resolve. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK>) there was one woman in the CSE group who developed meningitis which responded effectively to intravenous antibiotics. <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK> made reference to the ongoing collection of data not yet completed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>No subgroup differences between opioid CSE, null CSE and CSE were observed for the following outcomes: time from first injection to effective analgesia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>); need for rescue analgesia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>); number of women satisfied with analgesia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>); number of women who mobilise (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>); post dural puncture headache (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>); known dural tap (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>); number of women requiring blood patch (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>); urinary retention (<LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>); nausea/vomiting (<LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>); hypotension (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>); labour augmentation required (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>); normal delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-002.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.18</LINK>); instrumental delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-002.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.19</LINK>); caesarean section (<LINK REF="CMP-002.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.20</LINK>); umbilical arterial pH (<LINK REF="CMP-002.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.21</LINK>); umbilical venous pH (<LINK REF="CMP-002.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.22</LINK>) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.24</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, subgroup differences were observed for the following two outcomes: number of women who mobilise (P = 0.04, I² = 76.5%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>) and pruritus (P = 0.03, I² = 79.4%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-23 14:06:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no standard combined spinal-epidural (CSE) or epidural technique and this necessitated categorising individual interventions into groups for analysis, and the use of multiple comparisons for individual outcomes. <I>See</I> additional tables, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, for details. Nonetheless, in an attempt to maintain relevance with evolving clinical practice, we performed comparisons separately for CSE versus traditional epidurals and for low-dose epidurals. This appears to have some clinical relevance supported by this review with there being several outcomes significantly favouring CSE over the traditional forms which was not apparent when CSE was compared with the lower-dose variants, notably higher urinary retention, higher instrumental delivery rate and the need for rescue analgesia with traditional epidurals.</P>
<P>Proposed benefits of CSE analgesia in labour over epidural pain relief are increased mobility and a postulated beneficial effect on mode of delivery. In this update there are now data from eight studies involving 1240 women including one study involving traditional epidurals (<LINK REF="STD-Cortes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 2007</LINK>; 40 women) and seven studies (1200 women) involving low-dose epidurals (<LINK REF="STD-Breen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Breen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). There was no difference seen in the number of women who actually mobilised. In relation to mode of delivery there is also no apparent benefit attributable to CSE other than for a lower instrumental rate when compared with traditional epidurals. The rate of caesarean section would appear to be influenced by factors that to date have not emerged against these modes of regional analgesia. This is of interest not only in regard to progress of labour but also in relation to concerns for unfavourable fetal heart rate changes that have been attributed to the use of CSE techniques. This review does not include any outcomes specifically linked to fetal heart rate. However, if these effects are real there appears to be no support from this review of a significant translation of concern for the fetus to an increased rate of caesarean delivery. In relation to neonatal outcome there was no difference between CSE and epidural as identified by Apgar scores less than eight or seven at five minutes or the need for neonatal unit admission. Any possible differences between the two techniques in relation to the occurrence of unfavourable fetal heart rate changes during labour were not apparent from these results.</P>
<P>CSE was associated with a higher incidence of pruritus compared with low-dose epidural techniques. This is almost certainly a result of direct injection of opioids into the subarachnoid space.</P>
<P>From studies included in this review there was no difference in the number of women who expressed satisfaction with CSE analgesia compared with epidural. This was based on seven studies (involving 520 women), all of which involved low-dose epidurals (<LINK REF="STD-Bhagwat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kartawiadi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kartawiadi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sezer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Velde-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Velde 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vernis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeidan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeidan 2004</LINK>). It would appear that the marginally faster onset from the time of injection, potentially favouring CSE, and the higher incidence of pruritus, presumably favouring epidurals, do not significantly impact on the overall sense of satisfaction. It was noted, however, that the measurement of satisfaction was typically very simplistic, using four-point scales of a seemingly global experience.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are not the best means of assessing differences in the risk of rare complications, such as meningitis, as they invariably fail to recruit the number of participants necessary to show such differences. In this review a total of over 3200 women participated in all 27 included studies combined. This is insufficient to assess the occurrence of very rare events. However, the inclusion of data on long-term outcomes should still form part of large trials, such as <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001a</LINK>, so that perhaps in the future some benefit may be gained by collating the evidence from large numbers of studies. In the meantime, clinicians will have to rely on other forms of evidence, such as case reports and large cohort studies, for information on such rare events as meningitis and other neurological complications.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-23 14:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both combined spinal-epidural and epidural techniques are shown to provide effective pain relief in labour. There appears to be little basis for offering one technique over the other, with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with combined spinal-epidural (CSE) and less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. There is no difference in ability to mobilise, obstetric outcome or neonatal outcome. The significantly higher incidence with traditional epidural techniques of urinary retention based on one study involving 703 women and of rescue interventions, also with one other study involving 42 women, would favour the use of low-dose epidurals, although this should be tempered by the knowledge that only single studies have been involved in both instances.</P>

This may be important as the additional tasks involved in the preparation for, and performance of, a combined spinal-epidural block may potentially offset some of the advantage of quicker onset of analgesia. The difference in time of onset from the time of injection from this review is of the order of one contraction. In a busy obstetric service there are many factors that contribute to the total time between a woman requesting pain relief and when it is actually delivered and these may be far more relevant to the consumer.</P>
<P>While most papers gave data on numbers of women requiring delivery by caesarean section, none mentioned the type of anaesthesia for the surgery or the need for conversion to general anaesthesia for operative delivery. Avoidance of general anaesthesia still remains an important goal for obstetric anaesthetists. In this setting there are pros and cons for both the CSE and epidural techniques. The untested epidural catheter of a combined regimen may fail when topped up for theatre or result in intravascular injection. On the other hand, there are potential benefits of the intrathecal drugs used in terms of providing good surgical conditions and intra-operative comfort for the woman. The rate of conversion from regional to general anaesthesia is sufficiently common that a very large study may have sufficient power to provide some answers. This could be the basis of a future review if sufficient studies included these data.</P>
<P>The collection of data on longer-term sequelae following both CSE and epidural pain relief in labour is important. Rare and long-term adverse effects of spinal and epidural techniques are difficult to quantify through small randomised trials such as in this review. There are other side effects, however, that can be more specifically addressed. Most papers have focused on obstetric outcomes. In this review we have also attempted to identify other factors through outcome measures such as respiratory depression and maternal sedation but very few papers investigated these issues. Future research work should more specifically address the possible impact of intrathecal and epidural opioids on both mother and baby. One specific area of interest in this regard is a possible link to breastfeeding success which could be different between CSE and epidural variants with differing amounts of opioids.</P>
<P>No reviewed study addressed the economic aspects of both types of regional pain relief. Future research could include data on such aspects as cost of consumables, cost and length of hospital stay, consequences of hospital readmission and resources needed for patient follow-up after discharge.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Suggested systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>A number of studies, both included (<LINK REF="STD-Breen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Breen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1998</LINK>) and excluded from this review (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Camann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Camann 1992</LINK>) compared an intrathecal injection with an epidural bolus, and ended the study period with the first request for additional analgesia. While the exclusion of some such papers was made on other methodological grounds, the comparison of epidural and intrathecal (as opposed to combined spinal-epidural) analgesia for labour could form the basis of a future review.</P>
<P>Within this review there were a wide range of interventions included. Not only did the drugs used differ but also the techniques, with studies using repeat boluses or infusions, or both, at different time intervals for the maintenance of analgesia. For the purposes of this review, all have been included together but with an attempt to categorise them into broad groups to assist with interpretation of results. The use of this or a similar structure may facilitate the review of further studies in the future.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study identification</HEADING>
<P>Types of studies to be considered for review included all published randomised controlled trials involving a comparison of combined spinal-epidural (CSE) with epidural analgesia initiated for women in the first stage of labour. Trials were identified for inclusion by three review authors independently. Details of reasons for exclusion of any trial considered for review have been clearly stated. If there were any disagreements regarding inclusion of potentially eligible trials these were resolved by discussion and, if necessary, arbitration by a fourth review author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of included studies</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Three review authors independently assessed the quality of all relevant studies.</LI>
<LI>Details of randomisation were recorded as satisfactory, unclear or unsatisfactory. Studies were excluded from the review if randomisation was clearly unsatisfactory, e.g. by day of the week, case note number, date of birth, etc.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation was described as adequate, inadequate or unclear.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessments and the number of women lost to follow-up in included studies was noted.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Data were extracted using a structured form that captured patient demographics (e.g. primipara/multipara), stage of labour, use of oxytocics prior to regional technique.</LI>
<LI>The technique and drug details of the CSE and the epidural groups were noted and classified.</LI>
<LI>Three review authors independently extracted the data and differences resolved by referring to the original study.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratios.</LI>
<LI>An intention-to-treat analysis was performed to include all randomised women where possible.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We assessed possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. The large diversity of both CSE and epidural techniques used resulted in up to six separate subgroup analyses being conducted. The definition of these groups is covered in detail under the 'Interventions' section below. 'CSE' groups consisted of both local anaesthetic and opioid, 'opioid CSE' groups used only opioids in the CSE, while the 'null CSE' group consisted of studies with a spinal puncture but no intrathecal injection of drugs. 'Low-dose' epidurals used less than 0.25% bupivacaine or equivalent. Some epidural groups used only a test dose of local anaesthetic, i.e. a relatively small dose at the time of initiating the block. Hence, separate analyses were performed for studies comparing:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>CSE with both traditional epidural regimens and also low-dose epidural techniques;</LI>
<LI>other types of CSE regimens using an 'opioid only' spinal component with both traditional and low-dose techniques and also where only local anaesthetic as a test dose had been given.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding trials that:</P>
<OL>
<LI>do not report comparable groups, e.g. with respect to parity, age, use of oxytocics prior to administration of the regional technique; or</LI>
<LI>where outcomes have not been or may not have been properly blinded.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We tested for publication bias using the funnel plot visually.</P>
<P>We performed statistical analyses with the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) for calculation of the treatment effect as represented by either the random-effects or the fixed-effect models depending upon the status of heterogeneity.</P>
