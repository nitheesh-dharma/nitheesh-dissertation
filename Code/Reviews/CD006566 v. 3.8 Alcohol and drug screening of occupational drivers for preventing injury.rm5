<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-28 15:53:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Alcohol and drug abuse are serious public health problems worldwide. Workplace alcohol and drug testing is a common intervention, especially in developed nations, but it is costly and its use is controversial. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of alcohol and drug screening among occupational drivers for preventing injury.</P>
<P>We conducted a systematic search of the literature on the effects of alcohol and drug screening among occupational drivers for preventing injury. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and assessed their results. We found two time-series studies conducted in the USA. One was conducted in five large transportation companies, and it examined the effects of two interventions of interest: implementation of legislation for mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing. The other study was conducted using national injury data.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence that in the long term mandatory drug-testing interventions can be more effective than no intervention in reducing injuries in occupational drivers. For mandatory alcohol testing there was evidence of an immediate effect only.</P>
<P>Given the widespread practice of alcohol and drug testing and the paucity of evaluation studies found, more evaluation studies are needed. Interrupted time-series is a feasible study design for evaluating interventions that aim at preventing alcohol and drug related injuries. However, time-series studies of higher quality and of long duration are needed to increase the level of evidence. A cluster-randomised trial would be the ideal study design to evaluate the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of alcohol and drug screening of occupational drivers (operating a motorised vehicle) in preventing injury or work-related effects such as sickness absence related to injury.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-27 12:28:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the following databases up to June 2007 (or up to the latest issue then available): MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Occupational Health Field's specialised register, DARE, PsychINFO, ERIC, ETOH, CISDOC, NIOSHTIC, TRANSPORT, Zetoc, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation index and HSELINE. We also searched reference lists, relevant websites and conducted hand searching.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-27 12:29:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies (more than three time points to be measured before and after the study) and interrupted time-series (ITS) studies that evaluated alcohol or drug screening interventions for occupational drivers (compared to another intervention or no intervention) with an outcome measured as a reduction in injury or a proxy measure thereof.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-17 15:21:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We contacted authors of the included studies for further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-26 11:17:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included two interrupted time-series studies conducted in the USA. One study was conducted in five large US transportation companies (N = 115,019) that carried passengers and/or cargo. Monthly injury rates were available from 1983 to 1999. In the study company, two interventions of interest were evaluated: mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing programmes. The third study focused only on mandatory random drug testing and was conducted on federal injury data that covered all truck drivers of interstate carriers.</P>
<P>We recalculated the results from raw data provided by the study authors. Following reanalysis, we found that in one study mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing was associated with a significant decrease in the level of injuries immediately following the intervention (-1.25 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI -2.29 to -0.21) but did not significantly affect the existing long-term downward trend (-0.28 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.21).</P>
<P>Mandatory random drug testing was significantly associated with an immediate change in injury level following the intervention (1.26 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.16) in one study, and in the second study there was no significant effect (-1.36/injuries/100 person years, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.41). In the long term, random drug testing was associated with a significant increase in the downward trend (-0.19 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.07) in one study, the other study was also associated with a significant improvement in the long-term downward trend (-0.83 fatal accidents/100 million vehicle miles/year, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.58).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-16 14:01:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of drug and alcohol testing of occupational drivers for preventing injuries as a sole, effective, long-term solution in the context of workplace culture, peer interaction and other local factors. Cluster-randomised trials are needed to better address the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:40:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs constitutes a major global public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 2004</LINK>). In recent years, the role of alcohol and drug intoxication in work-related injuries and work-related crashes has received increasing attention (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>). In some safety-critical occupations a single mistake could have disastrous consequences in terms of death, injury and impact on public confidence (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>). Results of some recent surveys of alcohol and drug use provide ample cause for concern. In the United States (US), military personnel service members between the ages 18 and 25 had a twice as high prevalence of heavy drinking in the previous 30 days as civilians in the same age group (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2006</LINK>). In a British Health community postal survey, there was a significant association between illegal drug use and work-related traffic crashes independent of other associated variables like alcohol, health issues and prescription drug use (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). However a study analysing annual reports from 1995-2000 published by the US Department of Transportation estimated that only less than one crash in 1,000 per year was attributable to employee alcohol use (<LINK REF="REF-Cunradi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunradi 2005</LINK>). For drugs the estimate was 4 to 7 crashes annually in 1,000 crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Cunradi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunradi 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-28 15:59:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Alcohol and drug testing involves the analysis of biological material to detect these substances or their metabolites in the body. Testing may involve analysis of blood, urine, saliva, sweat, hair and breath samples (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>). The timing of work-related testing can take a variety of forms, including pre-employment testing, random testing of employees and post-accident testing, reasonable suspicion testing, follow-up and return-to-duty testing.</P>
<P>Workforce drug and alcohol testing is extremely controversial and there has been prolonged debate over the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, ethics and legality of the practice (<LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>). In the US an estimated 80% of the large employers currently use some form of alcohol and/or drug testing of employees (<LINK REF="REF-Ozminkowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozminkowski 2003</LINK>). All Federal government employees and all workers in industries regulated by the Federal government are included in mandatory screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Spiehler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiehler 1994</LINK>). Mandatory drug testing for safety-sensitive occupations was announced in 1988 by the United States Department of Transportation Industry (federal law) and implemented in 1990 (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 2003</LINK>). There is a relative paucity of research evidence on the nature and extent of workforce drug and alcohol testing outside the US. Legislation and implementation varies between and within countries. In Canada, the United Kingdom and other European countries, workforce testing has been primarily concentrated in safety and security critical industries and professions where it has been argued that the public is entitled to expect the highest standards of safety and probity (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>). While selective drug-free workplace programmes have been associated with an industry specific preventive effect, this tends to occur in the construction and service sectors where two key factors are influential: background level of injury risk and prevalence of substance abuse in the workforce (<LINK REF="STD-Wickizer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wickizer 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-28 16:04:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Alcohol and drug testing may prevent workplace-related injuries by deterring the misuse of illicit substances among employees thereby reducing risks to health and safety in the work environment. Other purported benefits of testing include: improved employee welfare, reduced risks to the production process, enhanced public confidence in the organisation and improved medical fitness thereby reducing healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent study of analyses within the construction industry indicated that companies with drug-testing programmes experienced a 51% reduction in injury incident rates within two years of implementation (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2002</LINK>). In contrast to general prevalence data, with a substance misuse testing programme in place in the US Air Force, the overall test positive rates for marijuana and cocaine were very low (<LINK REF="REF-Grayson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grayson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Any potential benefits of testing must be weighed against potential harms which include: the fallibility of testing and the consequences associated with false positives (for example, when legally available drugs produce a positive test for illicit substances) and false negatives (the failure to identify persons misusing alcohol or illicit drugs); the initiation of legal proceedings against employers for inappropriately dealing with performance issues or policing the private behaviour of the workforce (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 1991</LINK>). Other potential harms include damaged employer/employee relations and reduced productivity, negative impacts on 'health and safety' arising from underreporting of minor injuries or 'near misses' for fear of triggering testing procedures, stigmatisation of those testing positive and the human resource implications for those who may have tested positive in 'pre-employment screening' (<LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, cost issues and ethical issues have been raised. A sound testing method and test chain process is not standardised internationally.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-02 12:16:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Ongoing research, monitoring and analysis of the impact and development of drug testing at work have recently been advocated (<LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>). Although there have been several reviews written on this topic, no systematic synthesis has previously been carried out of the evidence relating to the benefits and harms of alcohol and drug testing in a workforce that primarily operates vehicles (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IIDTW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIDTW 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Levine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2004</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-28 16:30:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>For time-series studies, data from the original papers were reanalysed according to the recommended methods for analysis of interrupted time-series (ITS) designs for inclusion in systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2004</LINK>). These methods utilise a segmented time-series regression analysis to estimate the effect of an intervention while taking into account secular time trends and any autocorrelation between individual observations. For each study, a first order autoregressive time-series model was fit to the data using a modification of the parameterization of <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2004</LINK>. Details of the mode specification are as follows:</P>
<P>Y= ß<SUB>0</SUB>+ ß<SUB>1</SUB>time+ ß<SUB>2</SUB> (time-p) I(time &gt; p) +ß<SUB>3</SUB> I(time &gt; p)+ E, E~ N(0, s2)</P>
<P>For time =1,...,T, where p is the time of the start of the intervention, I (time &gt; =p) is a function which takes the value 1 if time is p or later and zero otherwise, and where the errors E are assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process (AR1). The parameters ß have the following interpretation:<BR/>ß<SUB>1</SUB> is the pre-intervention slope.<BR/>ß<SUB>2</SUB> is the difference between post and pre-intervention slopes.<BR/>ß<SUB>3</SUB> is the change in level at the beginning of the intervention period, meaning that it is the difference between the observed level at the first intervention time point and that predicted by the pre-intervention time trend.</P>
<P>No pooling of data across studies was carried out because one study used measured data and the other used federal records that didn't show how many drivers the intervention affected.</P>
<P>We used a rating system, based on the Levels of Evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>), to summarise the strength of scientific evidence of the effects of the intervention. The rating system was based on both the quality and the outcome of the studies as follows:<BR/>I. Strong evidence - consistent findings in multiple high quality RCTs or CCTs;<BR/>II. Moderate evidence - consistent findings in multiple low quality RCTS, CBAs, ITS and/or one high quality RCT;<BR/>III. Limited evidence - one low quality RCT or one CBA study or one ITS;<BR/>IV.

<P>
<I>Design of the study</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> is an evaluation of a workplace peer-focused substance abuse prevention and early intervention program (titled PeerCare) evaluated against the background of federally mandated random drug and alcohol testing in an interrupted time-series design from 1983 to 1996. Because we were given access to the raw data we could focus our reanalysis on the testing interventions instead of the primary substance abuse prevention intervention. This voided the reported intervention versus control setup and made all study companies part of the intervention group. <LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> evaluated the effects of the PeerCare and testing interventions, and measured reportable injuries only, whereas another paper that used the same data (Miller 2007) measured both reportable and minor injuries and estimated the cost effectiveness of the PeerCare and testing interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swena 1999</LINK> is an evaluation of federally mandated random drug testing on fatal truck accidents in an interrupted time-series design from 1983 to 1997. The data were obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System database which is maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</P>
<P>
<I>Participants and duration of study</I>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK>, a retrospective analysis was conducted using cross-sectional time-series data to examine the association between occupational injury rate and (1) federally mandated drug testing and (2) federally mandated alcohol testing. The study duration was 13 years, from 1983 until 1996. The study population consisted of approximately 115,019 employees in five large interstate transport companies that carried passengers and/or cargo in the USA. The number of occupational injuries reported to the Federal government between January 1983 and June 1996, that were calculated as injuries per 100,000 employee-hours, was tabulated monthly for the five companies (study and controls). Injuries were reportable to the Federal government if they resulted in (1) death or medical treatment and/or (2) restricted or lost workdays. In Miller 2007, injury data was available until 1999 and included reportable as well as not-reportable injuries. These were generally minor injuries that were treated by a non-health professional and did not result in lost work days.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swena 1999</LINK> reports that the number of active truck drivers (i.e. number of participants exposed to the intervention) is not actually known with a sufficient degree of accuracy. The study duration was 14 years, from 1984 to 1997.</P>
<P>
<I>Types of interventions</I>
<BR/>In the USA, federally mandated random drug testing for safety-sensitive occupations in the transportation industry commenced on January 1st 1990 and random and for-cause alcohol testing on August 15th 1994. Biological sampling and the quality of testing were outlined in the federal testing regulations to be interpreted by management of the employing organisation. The PeerCare intervention that did not fulfil our inclusion criteria was introduced in 1987. It was a union-management partnership and training activity to recognize and intervene with problem (impaired) workers on-the-job, and to change attitudes to substance use in the workplace. In addition, in 1995 there was a safety restructuring procedure that affected one of the study companies.</P>
<P>
<I>Types of outcome measures</I>
<BR/>The primary outcome measure in <LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> was the injury rate per 100,000 employee-hours. The secondary outcomes were the costs of both program implementation and of occupational injuries. In <LINK REF="STD-Swena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swena 1999</LINK> the primary outcome measure was the rate of large truck fatal accidents per 100 million vehicle miles travelled. A large truck was defined as weighing over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, including single unit trucks and truck tractors.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> met four of the quality criteria recommended for interrupted time-series studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2004</LINK>):</P>
<P>The intervention was unlikely to affect data collection. As the main outcome was routinely collected data on injuries to be reported to the federal regulatory agency, it is unlikely that the introduction of drug and alcohol testing impacted on the way the data was collected. The authors indicated that they merged individual records with personnel files with negligible problems.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was assessed blindly or measured objectively. The injury figures were good objective measures of medium to serious injuries as they included only those injuries to be reported to the federal regulatory agency. Reportable injuries were defined by clear criteria (injuries that result in death, medical treatment and/or restricted or lost work days).</P>
<P>The primary outcome was reliable or measured objectively.</P>
<P>The composition of the data set at each point in time covered at least 80% of the total number of events in the study. As monthly official injury statistics were used we assume that these covered close to 100% of all events that happened in the particular month.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> did not meet the remaining four criteria:</P>
<P>The shape of the intervention effect was not specified <I>a priori</I>. The study lacked specific hypotheses. Neither the expected effect of the random alcohol and drug testing nor the effect of the Peer Care programme were specified in advance.</P>
<P>The intervention had not occurred independently of other changes over time. The introduction of federally mandated drug testing (1990) followed by alcohol testing (1994) overlapped with the Peer Care intervention (1987) making it difficult to differentiate between the effects of the interventions. The workplace culture of the study companies is also likely to have changed in the pre-intervention period when the US government changed Federal employment culture in 1986 by requiring employees to refrain from the use of illegal drugs. In addition, safety restructuring in one of the study companies in 1995 also overlapped with the drug and alcohol testing.</P>
<P>No rationale for the number and spacing of data points was described. However, the spacing of data points was pre-set by the monthly injury data reporting and can be considered as sensitive enough to show changes in injuries over time due to the interventions. The period covered was probably long enough to reveal both immediate and long-term post-intervention effects on injuries.</P>
<P>The main emphasis of the study was on evaluating the effect of the Peer Care programme rather than random alcohol or drug testing. Therefore the applied analyses were not relevant for isolating the effects of random drug and alcohol testing from the effects of the Peer Care programme.</P>
<P>Weaknesses in the study are indicated by a lack of data on post-accident drug and alcohol tests from the period prior to the workplace intervention. Separate analysis of subgroups was not possible.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Swena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swena 1999</LINK> also met four of the quality criteria recommended for interrupted time-series studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2004</LINK>):</P>

<P>No rationale for the number and spacing of data points was described. The period covered was probably long enough to reveal both immediate and long-term post-intervention effects on injuries.</P>
<P>Most likely the intervention did not occur independently of other changes over time because it is not known who were actually affected by the intervention and to what degree. If one assumes that the data represent all large interstate truck drivers then one can also assume that these individuals were also subjected to various limitations, rules, etc. No other influences apart from drug testing were considered in the study.</P>
<P>The study was analyzed appropriately as to the immediate effect but did not take into account the possibility of auto-correlation of the data. The change in fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles travelled was modelled by linear regression over the years 1984 to 1989. These were then extrapolated over the following years. In other words, the authors compared the scores following the introduction of the intervention to those that would have been expected based on the scores from before the intervention instead of comparing pre-intervention scores with post-intervention scores. There was no analysis of the long-term effect.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-12-01 12:55:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found no randomised trials of the effects of drug or alcohol testing of drivers for reducing injuries. The two included studies were interrupted time-series studies conducted in the USA. These studies provide limited evidence that mandatory random drug testing can decrease injuries in the long term although the results in the short term were contradictory. In one study, the effect size of the continuous drop of 0.19 injuries per 100 person years was small although the estimate can be considered as fairly precise with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.30 to 0.07. Another study found that mandatory random drug testing can increase the downward trend of the rate of fatal accidents by -0.83 fatal accidents per 100 million vehicle miles travelled per year.<BR/>
<BR/>The immediate drop in level of injuries (1.25 injuries/100 person years) after the implementation of mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing in the <LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> study can be judged as substantial although fairly imprecise. No change in the long-term slope - additional to the already downward trend - could be shown following this intervention. This could be due to the limited number of measurement points after the implementation of alcohol testing in 1994, thereby compromising statistical power. The change in the long term slope following the implementation of random drug testing in <LINK REF="STD-Swena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swena 1999</LINK> can only be seen as an approximation of the effect of the intervention because the size of the population represented by this data is not known.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Spicer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spicer 2005</LINK> study also assessed the effects of a peer-worker mediated workplace substance abuse programme (PeerCare) on the background of federally mandated drug and alcohol testing. Because of the overlap of these three interventions the independent effects of the testing interventions are difficult to differentiate.</P>
<P>According to the same study (publication Miller 2007) drug and alcohol testing interventions may also be cost-effective, at least in the US. However, the figures are based on overall company costs that, according to the authors, did not include some relevant costs like those of a pre-existing employee assistance program. The authors also do not describe the testing regimes in sufficient detail to allow comparisons with the costs expected in the healthcare systems of other countries. For this reason we did not try to adjust the figures for inflation or currency. Since we did not include in our systematic search strategy items or specialist databases addressing economic evaluation it is possible that we may have overlooked studies and data other than those conducted alongside effectiveness studies. The two included studies were both conducted in the USA and so it is unclear how the results might apply to Europe or to low and middle income countries.</P>
<P>The excluded studies either used ITS study designs that did not satisfy our inclusion criteria (i.e. less than three time points measured before and after the study), or they did not relate substance testing with number of injuries.</P>
<P>A strong aspect of our time-series analysis is that it adjusted for secular and other cyclical changes in the auto-regressive time-series model. This is especially pertinent with this review as the past fifty years have shown a rather steady downward trend in injuries. Nonetheless, a clear drawback of the time-series design is that it is susceptible to bias as introduced by co-interventions (interventions that are introduced concurrently), as well as the determination of the point in time where the intervention is introduced and the type of effect the intervention can have over time. Our recalculations of the results consider only one intervention at a time by comparing all data points preceding the intervention to those following it.</P>
<P>It was not possible to assess the extent to which publication bias may have been present due to the small number of included studies. We attempted to reduce the likelihood of language bias by not having language restrictions in the systematic search strategy.</P>
<P>Cluster-randomised trials are needed to better address the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with other reviews</HEADING>
<P>We found no previous systematic or narrative reviews of the effects of drug or alcohol testing to reduce injuries specifically in drivers. The review by <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2001</LINK> about the effects of drug testing to decrease injuries in nonspecific workplaces concluded that: "...the published evidence for effects such as reduced injury or accident rates lacks scientific detail". In another systematic review about injury prevention in a different occupational setting, the construction industry (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Molen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Molen 2007</LINK>), an intervention aiming at a drug-free workplace evaluated with an interrupted time-series design in a large company was shown to be effective in reducing the level and the trend of injuries over time. The interrupted time-series design therefore seems to be feasible in evaluating interventions that aim to prevent injuries in the workplace. A standardised approach to analysis and reporting is needed to be able to compare and possibly synthesize data across studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-01-16 14:01:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of drug and alcohol testing of occupational drivers for preventing injuries as a sole, effective, long-term solution in the context of workplace culture, peer interaction and other local factors. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-17 15:21:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given the widespread practice of alcohol and drug testing and the paucity of evaluation studies found, more evaluation studies are needed. Interrupted time-series is a feasible study design for evaluating interventions that aim at preventing alcohol and drug related injuries. However, time-series studies of higher quality and of sufficient duration are needed to increase the level of evidence. A cluster-randomised trial would be the ideal study design to evaluate the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.</P>

<P>The inclusion criteria and the instrument for judging study quality were changed.</P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that we would include interrupted time-series (ITS) studies only when they used a control group. When conducting the review proper, we soon realised this was contradictory to our initial intention of including properly conducted ITS studies. According to our definition, ITS studies have been conducted properly when they have conducted at least three outcome measurements before and after the intervention. The inclusion of a control group is therefore of less importance. The idea behind ITS studies is to compare the situation before an intervention to the situation following its implementation (rather than intervention vs. control). We implemented this correction to the review inclusion criteria before we had an idea what this would do to the results. Therefore ITS studies without a control group, but with three outcome measurements before and after the intervention, were included.</P>
<P>From other reviews using ITS studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Molen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Molen 2007</LINK>) we learned that there was a better instrument for judging quality (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2004</LINK>) and that we should use that instrument instead of the one we had chosen (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK> checklist was initially chosen because in addition to randomised controlled trials it could also be applied to (non-randomised) controlled clinical trials. Since no randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were included in the review we don't think this biased the results.</P>
