<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The effect of platinum-containing regimens for women with metastatic breast cancer is generally well established. The results in the 2016 review update are consistent with findings of the previous review, mainly in women without triple-negative breast cancer. In the future, however, the scope of this review topic will be modified and likely involve an assessment of platinum-containing regimens in women with a specific subtype of breast cancer (that is, triple-negative breast cancer or BRCA mutation and metastatic breast cancer). Such a topic will be classified as a new review in the Cochrane Library.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the issue? </B>Metastatic breast cancer occurs when the cancer has spread to areas of the body beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes. Although metastatic breast cancer is generally not curable, it is widely accepted that women with metastatic disease should receive some form of chemotherapy to help ease the severity of disease symptoms, while hopefully extending survival time. Chemotherapy containing platinum is known to be effective for treating a number of cancer types including lung, testicular, head and neck, bladder and ovarian cancers, but it also known to cause more adverse effects (such as nausea and vomiting, hair loss, anaemia, kidney damage and leukopenia (low white blood cells)) than other chemotherapy options. The two platinum agents most commonly used for treating metastatic breast cancer are carboplatin and cisplatin.</P>
<P>The original version of this review (2004) concluded that chemotherapy containing platinum did not increase survival time for women treated for metastatic breast cancer. Since then, however, researchers have discovered that there are a variety of subtypes of breast cancer which may respond differently to different types of chemotherapy. One of these subtypes &#8212; triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) &#8212; makes up approximately 12 to 17% of breast cancers and is associated with shorter survival and higher likelihood that the cancer returns. Some researchers have speculated that chemotherapy containing platinum might be more effective in treating metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) than other chemotherapy options.</P>
<P>
<B>Why does it matter?</B> There are at least two reasons why it is important to update the evidence on this topic. First, it is important to assess whether our 2004 conclusions &#8212; based on 12 early studies &#8212; are representative of the 24 studies who have now published or provided results through to 2015. Second, it is important to assess whether chemotherapy containing platinum increases survival for women with mTNBC more than other chemotherapy options.</P>
<P>
<B>We asked</B> whether chemotherapy treatments containing a platinum agent are more or less effective for treating women with metastatic breast cancer than chemotherapy treatments not containing a platinum agent. We also asked the same question, but with a focus on women with mTNBC.</P>
<P>
<B>We found </B>24 studies involving 4418 women. The evidence is current to May 2015. Five of the 24 studies specifically assessed women with mTNBC while the other 19 studies assessed women with metastatic breast cancer in general (mainly women without mTNBC). This review found that, compared to chemotherapy without platinum, chemotherapy with platinum did not increase survival time by any important degree for women with metastatic breast cancer in general (mainly women without mTNBC). The quality of the evidence for this was considered to be high, meaning that we are confident about the results. For women with mTNBC, however, this review found that chemotherapy containing platinum may increase survival time over chemotherapy without platinum, but the quality of the evidence for this is low at this point in time (largely due to the small number of studies that have assessed mTNBC). This review also found that chemotherapy including platinum reduced the number of breast cancer recurrences compared to chemotherapy that did not contain platinum in women with mTNBC, however these findings also currently come from low-quality evidence. There was no difference in the number of breast cancer recurrences for women receiving platinum or non-platinum chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in general. Chemotherapy with platinum was more likely to shrink tumours compared to chemotherapy without platinum, but this result needs to be considered cautiously.</P>
<P>Compared with women receiving chemotherapy without platinum, women receiving chemotherapy with platinum experienced higher rates of nausea/vomiting, anaemia, leukopenia and hair loss.</P>
<P>
<B>This means </B>it is difficult to justify using chemotherapy containing platinum for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that is not mTNBC, given that similarly effective but less toxic chemotherapy is commonly available. Chemotherapy containing platinum may provide a survival benefit to mTNBC participants of sufficient magnitude to justify its use, but the quality of the evidence for this is low at this point in time. Further studies are required before a more definitive conclusion can be made.</P>

<P>For this review update, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 28 May 2015.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-16 14:31:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>At least two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and extracted all relevant data from each study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived for time-to-event outcomes, where possible, and fixed-effect models were used for meta-analyses. Objective tumour response rates (OTRRs) and toxicities were analysed as binary (dichotomous) outcomes with risk ratios (RRs) used as measures of effects. Quality of life data were extracted where available. GRADE was used to rate the quality of evidence for survival and tumour response outcomes at the level of subgroups selected and unselected for mTNBC, and for toxicity outcomes based on combining data from selected and unselected populations.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 12:52:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update includes 15 new eligible treatment-comparisons from 12 studies. In total, 28 treatment-comparisons, involving 4418 women, from 24 studies are now included in one or more meta-analyses. Of the 28 treatment-comparisons, 19 and 16 had published or provided extractable time-to-event data on overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival/time to progression (PFS/TTP), respectively. All 28 treatment-comparisons provided OTRR data that could be included in meta-analyses. Most women recruited to the studies were not selected on the basis of mTNBC status.</P>
<P>In a subgroup of three treatment-comparisons assessing women with mTNBC, platinum-containing regimens may have provided a survival benefit (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). In women unselected for intrinsic subtypes such as mTNBC, there was little or no effect on survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; high-quality evidence). This effect was similar to the combined analysis of survival data for both populations (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07; I<SUP>2</SUP> =39%, 1868 deaths, 2922 women; 19 trials). The difference in treatment effects between mTNBC women compared with unselected women was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05).</P>
<P>Data from three treatment-comparisons with mTNBC participants showed that platinum regimens may improve PFS/TTP (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.72; low-quality evidence). Thirteen treatment-comparisons of unselected metastatic participants showed that there was probably a small PFS/TTP benefit for platinum recipients, although the confidence interval included no difference (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). Combined analysis of data from an estimated 1772 women who progressed or died out of 2136 women selected or unselected for mTNBC indicated that platinum-containing regimens improved PFS/TTP (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). There was marked evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.0004; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63%). The larger treatment benefit in mTNBC women compared with unselected women was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence of better tumour response in both subgroups of women with mTNBC and unselected women (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.56; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, respectively). Combined analysis of both populations was closer to the effect in unselected women (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22; 4130 women). There was considerable evidence of heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%), which may reflect between-study differences and general difficulties in assessing response, as well as the varying potencies of the comparators.</P>
<P>Compared with women receiving non-platinum regimens: rates of grade 3 and 4 nausea/vomiting were probably higher among women receiving cisplatin- (RR 2.65, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.34; 1731 women; moderate-quality evidence) but the effect from carboplatin-containing regimens was less certain (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.26; 1441 women; moderate-quality evidence); rates of grade 3 and 4 anaemia were higher among women receiving cisplatin- (RR 3.72, 95% CI 2.36 to 5.88; 1644 women; high-quality evidence) and carboplatin-containing regimens (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.70; 1441 women; high-quality evidence); rates of grade 3 and 4 hair loss (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.58; 1452 women; high-quality evidence) and leukopenia (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.57; 3176 women; moderate-quality evidence) were higher among women receiving platinum-containing regimens (regardless of platinum agent).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 12:38:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In women with metastatic breast cancer who do not have triple-negative disease, there is high-quality evidence of little or no survival benefit and excess toxicity from platinum-based regimens. There is preliminary low-quality evidence of a moderate survival benefit from platinum-based regimens for women with mTNBC. Further randomised trials of platinum-based regimens in this subpopulation of women with metastatic breast cancer are required.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-16 09:24:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>Breast cancer is both the most common type of cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer death in women (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>). In 2012, there was an estimated 1.67 million estimated new cases and approximately 522,000 deaths from breast cancer worldwide, with an age standardised death rate (ASR) of 12.9 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>). ASRs of 25 or greater were recorded that same year in Fiji (28.4), Bahamas (26.3), Nigeria (25.9), Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia (25.5) and Pakistan (25.2) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The stage of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis is an important indicator of prognosis. Once breast cancer becomes metastatic, it is not generally considered curable and most women with metastatic disease do not survive beyond five years from the time of their metastatic diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Clements-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clements 2012</LINK>). Another important predictor of prognosis is the biological subtype of breast cancer. One of these subtypes &#8212; triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) &#8212; is characterised by a lack of expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PgR) and human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC comprises approximately 12 to 17% of breast cancers and is associated with shorter survival and higher likelihood of recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 2010</LINK>). The median survival time for women diagnosed with metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) is about one year from their metastatic diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kassam-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassam 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is no evidence from randomised trials comparing chemotherapy with observation (no chemotherapy) in women with metastatic breast cancer, it is widely accepted that women with metastatic disease should receive some form of systemic therapy at some time during the course of their metastatic disease. Chemotherapy is considered by many to be the appropriate first treatment option for women with multiple sites of recurrence or where visceral disease is not easily treated by local modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beslija-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beslija 2009</LINK>). Chemotherapy is also considered to be useful in women whose cancer is hormone refractory or is expected to be hormone resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 1996</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-16 09:24:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>Platinum compound, an alkylating agent, has been known to be active in metastatic breast cancer since clinical trials in the 1970s. However, it is more toxic and difficult to administer than other chemotherapy agents. The three most widely used platinum agents for treating breast cancer are cisplatin, carboplatin (both divalent complexes) and oxaliplatin (a tetravalent complex) (<LINK REF="REF-Sikov-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikov 2015</LINK>). Cisplatin and carboplatin have demonstrated benefits in treating a number of cancer types including lung, testicular, head and neck, bladder and ovarian cancers. Oxaliplatin is often used to treat cisplatin- and carboplatin-resistant tumours because it is commonly believed that cross-resistance between oxaliplatin and cisplatin or carboplatin is incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Mani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mani 2002</LINK>). More recent evidence suggests that the benefits of oxaliplatin may be due to its low toxicity and ability to be combined with other drugs rather than incomplete cross-resistance with other platinum agents (<LINK REF="REF-Stordal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stordal 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of oxaliplatin for treating breast cancers is much less common than the use of cisplatin or carboplatin, both in normal clinical practice and as an intervention in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Sikov-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikov 2015</LINK>). Cisplatin and carboplatin have been used and studied extensively as first-line metastatic therapy in combination with other older pharmacological agents including 5-fluorouracil and etoposide, and more recently with doxorubicin, epirubicin, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and gemcitabine. The potential benefits of cisplatin or carboplatin as monotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, rather than as combination therapy, are rarely studied in clinical trials.</P>
<P>Although platinum agents have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of a number of cancer types, their use is often associated with a variety of side effects. The known side effects of platinum agents include nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia and anaemia), peripheral neuropathy (symptoms include tingling in fingers and toes), nephrotoxicity, ototoxicities (hearing loss and tinnitus), hypomagnesaemia and anaphylaxis. Carboplatin is reported to be more tolerable than cisplatin with less nausea and vomiting, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and neurotoxicity, but worse myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Sikov-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikov 2015</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-16 09:35:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>The exact mechanism of action of platinum agents is not known but deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts are formed (<LINK REF="REF-Sikov-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikov 2015</LINK>). These complexes are believed to inhibit DNA synthesis, replication and transcription by forming interstrand and intrastrand cross-linking of DNA molecules. Interstrand cross-links that remain intact can produce cell death, and it is this cytotoxic effect, when successful, that forms the mechanistic basis of action for cancer cell death by platinum agents (<LINK REF="REF-Noll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noll 2006</LINK>). For TNBC, it has been additionally hypothesised that a dysfunctional <LINK REF="STD-BRCA" TYPE="STUDY">BRCA</LINK>1 pathway in some TNBCs may make them more sensitive to platinum agents that selectively target cells deficient in homologous recombination DNA repair (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-16 14:31:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>There are a number of reasons for updating this review. First, this review was originally published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Carrick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrick 2004</LINK>) and was based on 12 studies (13 treatment-comparisons) identified from a May 2003 search of the literature. Although there have since been some updates to this review containing minor amendments, no new searches for relevant studies have been conducted since 2003. In the current review update, the number of included studies has increased from 12 in the original version of this review to 24 (28 treatment-comparisons). This allows effects to be estimated with greater precision than before and provides an opportunity to conduct new subgroup analyses corresponding to emerging evidence and new hypotheses. Second, all 12 studies included in the original version of this review were conducted prior to the 'intrinsic subtype' era and thus did not specifically focus on TNBC (a term first mentioned in the medical literature in October 2006) (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 2010</LINK>). Since 2009, however, five randomised control trials have published data specifically on the effects of platinum-based regimens on survival, progression or tumour response in mTNBC participants; the inclusion of these five trials in this review update represents the first meta-analysis of such trials. Third, some interest remains in the use of platinum agents for the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer in general (i.e. unselected for intrinsic subtypes such as mTNBC) (<LINK REF="REF-Shamseddine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shamseddine 2012</LINK>). This is notwithstanding the primary conclusion contained in the original version of this review that "...in view of the significant excess toxicity, lack of progression or survival benefit and the availability of less toxic active agents it is difficult to justify the use of platinum-containing regimens, particularly as first-line treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer in routine clinical practice."</P>

<P>Women with advanced (metastatic) breast cancer, either newly diagnosed or recurrent. Treatment-comparisons that included both women with metastatic disease and women with loco-regionally recurrent disease only were eligible for inclusion if it was possible to distinguish between the two groups (i.e. data were reported separately) or if women with isolated locoregional recurrence were less than 20% of the total group. There were no age restrictions.<BR/>
<BR/>In the protocol for this review, it was proposed that treatment-comparisons would be included if the women randomised to receive chemotherapy, were to receive it as first-line treatment (i.e. no previous chemotherapy given except as adjuvant therapy). As few treatment-comparisons assessing first-line treatment were identified for inclusion in the original version of this review, those meeting the remaining eligibility criteria but which involved participants who were not first-line naive were included. This modification of the inclusion criteria was maintained for this review update, with subgroup analysis by treatment being performed (treatment-comparisons with first-line therapy for &gt; 80% of participants vs other treatment lines).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-16 09:35:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>In this review update, potential sources of bias for all included studies (including those in the original version of this review) were assessed using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Risk of bias for each treatment-comparison was evaluated independently by at least two reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or adjudication from an additional reviewer. Clarification from authors was sought if the published data provided inadequate information for the review. The 'risk of bias' domains that were assessed were 'random sequence generation', 'allocation concealment', 'blinding of participants and personnel', 'blinding of outcome assessment', 'incomplete outcome data', 'selective reporting' and 'other bias'. For each included study, ratings of 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' risk of bias were assigned for each risk of bias domain following criteria outlined in the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Open-label studies are common in phase III oncology trials because it is often difficult to conceal treatments from participants, care-providers and outcome assessors (due to differences in toxicities and treatment schedules of various treatments, for example). However, because a lack of blinding can affect risk of bias in different ways for different outcomes, we assessed 'blinding of outcome assessment' by dividing outcomes into two outcome classes: 1) OS and 2) outcomes other than OS and quality of life. This division was made because, unlike other outcomes, assessment of OS is unlikely to be affected by non-blinding.</P>
<P>We also divided the 'incomplete outcome data' risk of bias domain into two outcome classes: 1) time-to-event outcomes and 2) binary (i.e. dichotomous) outcomes. For time-to-event outcomes, risk of bias was deemed low, unclear, and high risk if time-to-event analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT), modified intention-to-treat (mITT) or per-protocol, respectively. For the binary outcomes (OTRRs and toxicity rates), risk of bias was deemed low, unclear, and high risk if the highest percentage of randomised participants excluded from effect estimation was less than 10%, between 10% and 15%, or more than 15%, respectively.</P>
<P>For 'risk of bias' domains that were divided into outcome classes, assessments were made for all studies known to be measuring the outcomes, regardless of results being reported in sufficient detail to be included in meta-analysis or reported at all (e.g. a study might specify OS as an outcome in the study protocol but not report any results).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-06-16 14:31:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>OS, PFS/TTP and TTF were analysed as time-to-event outcomes, for which the hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate measure of treatment effect. If reported, the HR and associated variance were extracted directly from the trial publication(s), and these were used to calculate observed (O) minus expected (E) numbers of events and logrank variance (V) for each treatment-comparison using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. If not reported, O - E and V were obtained indirectly from other available summary statistics or from data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. For studies that did not report the relevant effect estimates and required curve extraction, the numbers at risk were based on reported minimum and maximum follow-up times. If these were not reported, minimum follow-up was estimated as the time taken to complete treatment, and maximum follow-up was estimated using the last event reported in the relevant time-to-event curve. These follow-up estimates were recorded in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table under 'Notes'. For the purposes of data extraction, preference was given to time-to-event effect estimates derived from ITT analysis, followed by mITT analysis, then per-protocol analysis.</P>
<P>Pooled HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the O - E and V statistics for each treatment-comparison using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). The pooled HR represented the instantaneous risk of an event (such as death, disease progression or treatment failure) for women receiving platinum divided by the corresponding risk for those not receiving platinum. HRs less than 1.00 favoured the platinum-containing regimens and values greater than 1.00 favoured non-platinum regimens.</P>
<P>Toxicity rates and OTRRs were analysed as proportions using the risk ratio (RR) as the measure of treatment effect. OTRRs were most often calculated by trialists using only participants that were assessable for tumour response. These 'assessable participants' were generally defined as participants whose tumour response could be assessed according to prespecified criteria such as RECIST (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenhauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenhauer 2009</LINK>), but this definition was sometimes extended to additionally exclude participants who had not received a specified minimum dose of chemotherapy. In this review update and in the original version of this review, we calculated OTRRs using the numbers of assessable participants in the OTRR denominators, but we also separately calculated OTRRs using the numbers of randomised participants in the denominators. In this review update, however, only the results from the assessable participants analyses were reported as there was almost no difference between the results obtained using assessable and randomised participant denominators (the latter are available on request). Toxicity rates were most often calculated by trialists using a 'safety population' of participants who received a specified minimum dose of chemotherapy. We calculated toxicity rates for each study using the population used by that study.</P>
<P>Pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals were obtained through Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect analysis. The pooled RR represented the cumulative risk of an event for participants receiving platinum divided by the corresponding risk for those not receiving platinum. RRs greater than 1.00 favoured platinum-containing regimens and values less than 1.00 favoured non-platinum regimens.</P>
<P>Quality of life was generally reported as a continuous outcome. Hence, if sufficient quality of life data become available for meta-analysis in future review updates, the effect measure would most likely be the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), depending on whether the same or different validated questionnaires (respectively) were employed.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-06-02 10:11:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment-comparisons were the unit of analysis in this review and corresponded to pairwise comparisons of platinum and non-platinum regimens. Individual studies assessing more than one platinum-based regimen or more than one non-platinum regimen (or both) contributed more than one treatment-comparison to the review. Consequently, there were more treatment-comparisons in this review than there were studies.</P>
<P>Two studies each contained two non-platinum regimen (control) groups for comparison against a single platinum-based regimen (intervention) group. This was taken into account when treatment effect statistics were calculated by splitting each study into two treatment-comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Stemmler-2011-A" TYPE="STUDY">Stemmler 2011 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stemmler-2011-B" TYPE="STUDY">Stemmler 2011 B</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2009-A" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2009 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2009-B" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2009 B</LINK>) and halving the number of participants in their intervention groups (for odd numbered group sizes, the additional participant was arbitrarily distributed to the treatment-comparison with label ending with 'A'). Another study contained two platinum-based regimen (intervention) groups for comparison against a single non-platinum (control) group. This study was split into two treatment-comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2011-A" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2011 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2011-B" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2011 B</LINK>) with treatment effect statistics calculated by halving the number of participants in the control group (with additional participants again arbitrarily distributed to treatment-comparisons with label ending with 'A'). One other study was a four-armed trial and was also reported as two separate treatment-comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Berruti-2002-A" TYPE="STUDY">Berruti 2002 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berruti-2002-B" TYPE="STUDY">Berruti 2002 B</LINK>). For these two treatment-comparisons, no adjustments to participant numbers were required as their control and intervention groups were unique to each comparison. These methods for correcting for multiple intervention and/or control groups were suggested in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

I<SUP>2</SUP> is the proportion of variation that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. In conjunction with the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to assess heterogeneity using the rule of thumb guide outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (i.e. I<SUP>2</SUP> between 0% to 40% might not be important; between 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; between 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and between 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity).</P>

GRADE assessments were performed separately for selected subgroups related to effect estimate heterogeneity (or 'inconsistency' as labelled in the GRADE assessment criteria).</P>

<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess whether apparent inconsistencies in results relating to OS, PFS/TTP and OTRR were more likely to be due to differences in the underlying nature of these outcomes, or an artefact of the different treatment-comparisons available for the meta-analysis of each outcome. First, the pooled effect estimate for OTRR was recalculated restricting the meta-analysis to the 19 treatment-comparisons with extractable data on OS. Second, the pooled effect estimates for PFS/TTP and OS were recalculated restricting both meta-analyses to the 12 treatment-comparisons with extractable data on both OS and PFS/TTP.</P>
<P>In additional sensitivity analyses, PFS/TTP estimates were stratified according to whether the outcome was PFS or TTP. For these analyses, estimates were classified as PFS if the event of interest was defined as disease progression or death from any cause. Estimates were classified as TTP if the event of interest was defined as disease progression, which may also include cause-specific death from breast cancer. In instances where the event of interest was ambiguously defined or not defined at all, we relied on the authors label of the outcome for classifying as PFS or TTP.</P>

These 11 'unblinded' treatment-comparisons were judged to be at high risk of 'performance bias' due to the lack of blinding of participants and personnel to the treatment being administered. The remaining 17 treatment-comparisons were judged as at unclear risk of 'performance bias' because of a lack of information needed to make a firm conclusion. It seemed highly likely, however, that a number of these 17 treatment-comparisons would have also been 'unblinded', as open-label studies are common in phase III oncology trials.</P>

This is because death certification was unlikely to be affected by any lack of blinding.</P>
<P>For outcomes other than OS and QoL, five treatment-comparisons were judged to be at low risk of bias from a lack of blinding of outcome assessors due to these outcomes being measured/confirmed through formal assessments including imaging, biochemical tests and/or the involvement of an independent clinical or radiological review group (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cocconi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cocconi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cocconi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cocconi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Icli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Icli 2005</LINK>).

<P>The assessment of risk of bias from selective reporting included crosschecking the outcomes for which there were published results against the stated outcomes reported in trial registers (WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov) and published protocols. In our assessment of risk of bias from selective reporting, studies that began recruiting participants on or after July 1, 2005 were expected have a clinical registration or published protocol specifying the study outcome or they were deemed to be at high risk of bias from selective reporting. We chose July 1, 2005 as our cut-off date because the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) made a seminal announcement in September 2004 that clinical trials that begin recruiting on or after July 1, 2005 would not be considered for publication unless they were included on a clinical trials registry (<LINK REF="REF-De-Angelis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Angelis 2005</LINK>). Studies included in this review which began recruiting participants before July 1, 2005 and which did not have a trial registration or published protocol prespecifying study outcomes, were assumed to be at unclear risk of bias from selective reporting, unless additional evidence suggested otherwise.</P>
<P>Six treatment-comparisons from four studies were judged to be at low risk of bias from the selective reporting of outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stemmler-2011-A" TYPE="STUDY">Stemmler 2011 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stemmler-2011-B" TYPE="STUDY">Stemmler 2011 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2011-A" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2011 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2011-B" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2011 B</LINK>). Each of these studies was included on a clinical trials registry and their prespecified outcomes either matched those in the trial reports or non-matches were considered to be relatively minor. Three treatment-comparisons were judged to be at high risk of bias from the selective reporting of outcomes. The first of these was <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> which specified TTP, TTF and toxicity as outcomes in the trial registration, but did not report on these outcomes in either of two conference abstracts (future publications may report in more detail and this 'risk of bias' assessment may change). The second was <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK> which did not have a trial registration or published protocol and did not report the date that participants were first enrolled. However, given that <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK> was first published in December 2012 and that there were only 53 study participants, it seemed highly likely that recruitment began after July 1, 2005. Consequently, there was a high expectation of trial registration which this study failed to undertake. The third of these was <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharyya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharyya 2009</LINK> in which the abstract indicated that toxicity was recorded but no results were reported. In addition, for <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharyya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharyya 2009</LINK>, there was no trial registration or published protocol containing prespecified outcomes. The date that participant recruitment began was not reported, but given that this was first published in September 2009, it seemed likely that recruitment began after July 1, 2005. As of April 2015, there had been no further results published other than those in the conference abstract. The remaining 19 treatment-comparisons were judged to be at unclear risk of bias from the selective reporting of outcomes either because the trial was unregistered with recruitment starting before July 1, 2005 or the stated outcomes in the registry did not match those in the trial reports, but it was unclear if these non-matches posed a high risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall survival (OS)</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-seven of the 28 included treatment-comparisons assessed OS as an outcome; 19 provided sufficient OS data for pooling in meta-analyses. From these 19 treatment-comparisons, 2922 of 2956 randomised participants were analysed representing 99% of randomised participants in these treatment-comparisons (and there were about 1868 deaths). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between platinum-containing regimens or non-platinum regimens with a HR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, P = 0.64) with some heterogeneity identified across trials (P = 0.04; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 39%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis showed a marginally significant survival benefit in favour of platinum-containing regimens for three treatment-comparisons assessing women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) only (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; P = 0.05; low-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The difference between this pooled HR of 0.75 and that from 16 treatment-comparisons assessing participants unselected for TNBC (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; high-quality evidence) was marginally significant (P = 0.05); heterogeneity was not large in either subgroup (P = 0.23, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 32% and P = 0.09, 34% respectively).

<P>Twenty-four of the 28 included treatment-comparisons assessed PFS or TTP, or both, as an outcome; 16 provided sufficient data for pooling in meta-analyses of the composite outcome of PFS/TTP. From these 16 treatment-comparisons, 2136 out of 2162 (99%) randomised participants were analysed (and there were about 1772 events).

<P>Restricting the OTRR meta-analysis to the 19 treatment-comparisons with extractable data on OS had little impact on the pooled RR estimate (RR = 1.15 and RR = 1.13 in the original and sensitivity analyses, respectively). Restricting the OS and PFS/TTP meta-analyses to the 12 treatment-comparisons with extractable data on both OS and OS and PFS/TTP lowered the pooled HR estimate from HR = 0.98 to HR = 0.92 for OS, and from 0.85 to 0.80 for PFS/TTP. This represented a 6% reduction in the HR estimates for both OS and PFS/TTP and suggested that the relative difference between OS and PFS/TTP results was unlikely to be due to the different treatment-comparisons available for the meta-analysis of each outcome.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-16 14:31:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sam J Egger">
<P>In this review update and consistent with the findings of the original review, our results did not show an OS benefit from platinum-containing regimens compared to non-platinum regimens for women with metastatic breast cancer 'in general' (i.e. without regard to subgroups). The confidence limits for the OS pooled HR estimate suggested that platinum-containing regimens were unlikely to confer more than a 11% reduction in the risk of death and might increase the risk by up to 7%. The lack of an OS benefit for platinum-containing regimens was somewhat at odds with the significant PFS/TTP and OTRR benefits observed in this review. Compared to women receiving non-platinum regimens, those receiving platinum-containing regimens had a 15% lower rate of progression or death (as measured by PFS/TTP) and a 15% higher rate of complete or partial tumour response. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the discrepancies between the OS and OTRR findings, and between the OS and PFS/TTP findings, were unlikely to be due to the different sets of treatment-comparisons used in the various meta-analyses of OS, PFS/TTP and OTRR. Rather, these discrepancies seemed more likely to be related to PFS/TTP and OTRR being somewhat poor surrogate outcomes for OS in metastatic breast cancer research (<LINK REF="REF-Burzykowski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burzykowski 2008</LINK>), and perhaps also related to general difficulties in measuring tumour response. Given that OS is generally regarded as the outcome of choice for assessing treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer research (<LINK REF="REF-Burzykowski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burzykowski 2008</LINK>) and given that this review now has a sufficient number of included studies to estimate the effects of treatments on OS with relatively high precision, we think that considerably more weight should be given to the OS results than the PFS/TTP or OTRR results.</P>
<P>In the absence of subgroup analyses, heterogeneity of effect estimates was observed for PFS/TTP, OTRR and, to a lesser degree, OS. With regards to OS and PFS/TTP, heterogeneity was explained to a large extent by the triple-negative status of study participants. More specifically for OS, data from three treatment-comparisons assessing mTNBC participants showed a 25% reduction in the risk of death for recipients of platinum-containing regimens compared to recipients of non-platinum regimens (P = 0.05). In absolute terms, this 25% risk ratio reduction corresponded to about 93 fewer deaths at one year after metastatic diagnosis for every 1000 mTNBC participants who received platinum-containing chemotherapy, and about 105 fewer deaths at two years (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). In contrast, data from 16 treatment-comparisons, assessing participants unselected for TNBC, showed similar risks of death among platinum and non-platinum recipients (HR = 1.01). In relation to PFS/TTP, platinum-containing regimens reduced the risk of death or progression, or both, by about 41% for mTNBC participants (P &lt; 0.0001) but only by about 8% for participants unselected for mTNBC (P = 0.10). The difference between the pooled effect estimates of the mTNBC and 'unselected for mTNBC' subgroups was significant for PFS/TTP (P &lt; 0.0001) and on the margins of statistical significance for OS (P = 0.05) and OTRR (P = 0.05).</P>
<P>While we also found a number of other statistically significant subgroup differences for OTRR and PFS/TTP (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>), it is difficult to judge the importance or reliability of these findings, given that similar differences were not observed in relation to OS.</P>
<P>Assessments of toxicity showed that women receiving platinum-containing regimens experienced higher rates of grade 3 and 4 nausea/vomiting, anaemia, leukopenia and hair loss than women receiving non-platinum regimens. Subgroup analysis indicated that the higher rate of grade 3 and 4 nausea/vomiting was associated with cisplatin but not carboplatin use, and the increased risk of grade 3 and 4 anaemia was higher for cisplatin recipients than for carboplatin recipients.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-02 08:05:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review now includes data from 24 studies relating to 28 treatment-comparisons, with publications years ranging from 1984 to 2014. Of the 28 treatment-comparisons,19 (68%) and 16 (57%) provided sufficient time-to-event data to be included in OS and PFS/TTP meta-analyses, respectively. All 28 treatment-comparisons provided OTRR data that could be included in meta-analyses. A majority of treatment-comparisons had sufficient data on treatment-related death (n =15; 54%), nausea/vomiting (n =21; 75%), anaemia (n =20; 71%) and leukopenia (n =22; 79%) for inclusion in meta-analyses. Five (18%) and 12 (43%) treatment-comparisons had sufficient data on nephrotoxicity and hair loss for pooling, respectively. The evidence relating to treatment effects on quality of life remained almost wholly incomplete, with only three studies reporting quality of life results that could not be pooled in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Although data for the most important outcome (OS) was extractable for 68% of treatment-comparisons, the evidence would clearly be more complete if OS data were extractable for all 28 treatment-comparisons. Nonetheless, it is somewhat reassuring that sensitivity analyses restricting the OTRR meta-analysis to the 19 treatment-comparisons with extractable OS data did not appreciably change the OTRR pooled estimate of effect (RR=1.15 and RR=1.13 in the original and sensitivity analyses, respectively). This provides some evidence that the 'overall' pooled effect estimate for OS was unlikely to have changed substantively if OS data were extractable for all 28 treatment-comparisons. It is important to note, however, that although the 'overall' pooled estimate of effect for OS appeared robust to the missing treatment-comparisons, this may not be the case for smaller subgroups. For example, our finding of a significant OS benefit for mTNBC participants receiving platinum-containing regimens &#8213; based on data from only three treatment-comparisons &#8213; may have been different if we were able to include OS data from <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> in the meta-analysis. In this relatively large treatment-comparison of mainly mTNBC participants, median OS times were similar in the platinum and non-platinum groups.</P>
<P>The evidence in this review appeared to be generally applicable to the current practice of the treatment of metastatic breast cancer for a number of reasons. First, the platinum and non-platinum regimens used in the included trials contained most chemotherapy drugs currently used in clinical practice to treat metastatic breast cancer, including cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF), trastuzumab and various anthracyclines and taxanes. Second, the review included trials of women receiving first-line treatment and women receiving treatment after failure of previous anthracycline or taxane regimens. Third, the review was well populated with trials using the two most commonly used platinum agents for treating metastatic breast cancer &#8213; carboplatin and cisplatin. While the review had only one trial using oxaliplatin as the platinum agent, oxaliplatin is not widely used in clinical practice for treating breast cancers. Fourth, this review update is the first to use meta-analysis to synthesise the evidence on an issue of considerable interest and importance to clinical practice; namely, whether platinum-based chemotherapies improved survival outcomes for mTNBC participants.</P>

<P>Quality of evidence ratings relating to OS, PFS/TTP and OTRR effect estimates were graded separately for the subgroups of treatment-comparisons with women unselected for mTNBC (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and with mTNBC (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We identified no problems using the GRADE assessment criteria in relation to the OS effect estimate for the 'unselected' subgroup; hence, the quality of the evidence for this estimate was rated 'high'. For the 'mTNBC' subgroup, the quality of the evidence rating for the OS effect estimate was downgraded two levels to 'low' for 'imprecision' (because the confidence interval for the pooled estimate was wide and close to the null) and for 'suspected publication bias' (because of the absence of <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> from the OS meta-analysis). The quality of the evidence ratings for PFS/TTP and OTRR effect estimates ranged from 'low' to 'moderate' across the 'unselected' and 'mTNBC' subgroups for reasons including 'indirectness', 'imprecision' , 'inconsistency' and 'suspected publication bias' (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> for details).</P>
<P>Treatment effect estimates for four key toxicity outcomes were graded for quality of evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Gradings were stratified by 'type of platinum agent' (cisplatin or carboplatin) for nausea/vomiting and anaemia and not stratified for hair loss and leukopenia (because hair loss and leukopenia were not significantly related to 'type of platinum agent'). The quality of the evidence ratings were 'high' for hair loss and for anaemia (both cisplatin and carboplatin subgroups), and downgraded one level to 'moderate' for nausea/vomiting (both cisplatin and carboplatin subgroups) and leukopenia due to either 'imprecision' or 'inconsistency' (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> for details).</P>

<P>Although it is possible that we may not have identified every eligible study with published results, study protocol or clinical trial registration, this seemed unlikely given our highly sensitive search strategies, including access to the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group. A related but more insidious problem, however, was the risk of reporting bias arising from completed studies that never published their (largely) negative findings. While non-publication of negative findings probably has occurred less frequently in recent years (due to increasing pressures to preregister clinical trials and publish results within reasonable time-frames), many systematic reviews remain vulnerable to historical reporting bias. In this review, many of the included studies were conducted in an era when non-publication of negative findings was more likely, but it seemed unlikely that this would have substantively affected our OS main finding, given that this finding was itself negative.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Petrelli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrelli 2016</LINK> recently published a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials to assess the efficacy and safety of therapy with platinum salts in participants with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In their review, Petrelli reported overall pooled effect estimates similar to our estimates in terms of OS (HR = 0.91 vs HR = 0.98, respectively), PFS/TTP (HR = 0.84 vs HR = 0.85, respectively) and OTRR (odds ratio = 1.27 vs odds ratio = 1.33, respectively after recalculating our relative risk estimate into an odds ratio). It is important to note, however, that while the overall results of the two systematic reviews are similar, <LINK REF="REF-Petrelli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrelli 2016</LINK> included studies with 100% locally advanced participants whereas our review excluded studies with more than 20% of participants having isolated locoregional recurrence. In addition, our review extended the work of Petrelli through the inclusion of multiple additional subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, there has been only one other systematic review of randomised trials comparing the effects of platinum and non-platinum-containing regimens among participants with mTNBC (<LINK REF="REF-Guan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guan 2015</LINK>). That review, however, only performed meta-analyses of tumour response rates and not time-to-event outcomes. The OTRR meta-analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Guan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guan 2015</LINK> was comprised of three of the five mTNBC treatment-comparisons included in the current review (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharyya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharyya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK>); the additional inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK> in the current review resulted in a pooled OTRR estimate of effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.56), significantly lower than that of <LINK REF="REF-Guan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guan 2015</LINK> (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.53).</P>

<P>In view of the excess toxicity and limited survival benefits from platinum-based regimens, it is difficult to justify their use over commonly-available less toxic active agents as first-line treatment for metastatic patients without mTNBC. On the other hand, this review update found preliminary low-quality evidence of a moderate survival benefit for women with mTNBC. Consequently, although the evidence may be premature to recommend widespread use of platinum-based regimens for mTNBC patients, some women and clinicians may consider platinum-based regimens worth trying. While evidence from this review suggested that carboplatin was generally associated with less toxicity than cisplatin, it is not yet clear whether the possible benefits for women with mTNBC are related to the type of platinum agent.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-01 08:27:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It seems unlikely that the inclusion of additional randomised trials could alter our conclusion that platinum-containing regimens offer little or no survival benefit for women with metastatic breast cancer that is not confirmed to be mTNBC. In contrast, however, our finding of a moderate survival benefit for women with mTNBC was based on low-quality evidence from only three trials; hence, additional randomised trials are necessary to confirm this finding. It is also worth noting that <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> did not find an OS, PFS or OTRR advantage for women with mTNBC receiving carboplatin (vs docetaxel). However, in subgroup analysis restricted to 43 <LINK REF="STD-BRCA" TYPE="STUDY">BRCA</LINK>1/2 positive participants, <LINK REF="STD-Tutt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Tutt 2014</LINK> found carboplatin was associated with significantly better OTRRs, perhaps suggesting a useful line of future research.</P>

<LI>The protocol for this review proposed that trials would be included if study participants were to receive first-line treatment. As few trials assessing first-line treatment were identified for inclusion in the original version of this review, those meeting the remaining eligibility criteria but which involved participants who were not first-line naive were included. This modification of the inclusion criteria was maintained for this review update with subgroup analysis by treatment line being performed (treatment-comparisons with first-line therapy for &gt; 80% of participants vs second- or third-line therapy for &#8805; 20% of participants).</LI>
<LI>Six of the seven subgroup analyses in this review were not prespecified in the review protocol and were added to the review in response to new hypotheses and available subgroups. Three of the six 'post hoc' subgroup analyses were added in this review update and the other three were included in the original version of the review.</LI>

<P>Reported hazard ratios and confidence intervals were inconsistent with the Kaplan Meier curves. For example, the text stated that the difference in OS "was not statistically significant", yet the reported 95% confidence interval was 0.88 to 0.92 (not only was the confidence interval highly statistically significant, it was far too narrow, given the cohort size). Consequently, we extracted OS and TTP data from the Kaplan-Meier curves rather than relying on the reported hazard ratios.</P>

<P>The abstract mentions that toxicity was recorded but no results were reported. In addition, there was no trial registration or published protocol containing prespecified outcomes. The date when participant recruitment began was not reported, but given that this was first published in September 2009, it seemed likely that recruitment began after July 1, 2005. As of April 2015, there has been no further results published other than those in the conference abstract.</P>
