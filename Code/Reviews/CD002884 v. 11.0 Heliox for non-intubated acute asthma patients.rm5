It is of interest that the variability of the absolute values is less than that of the change scores in this case!&lt;br&gt;I have recalculated the confidence intervals for the between sub-group tests and put them in red. Otherwise there is a tedious job changing over the lung function results to make them all positive and changing the labels on the graphs to favour Heliox on the right. Could you do this and then the update is ready for submission?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Final check 25 July 2006&lt;br&gt;Thanks for confirming all results as final values, and for making the changes to the subgroup reporting. I am however confused after reading the table of included studies and the pdf of the latest study from Lin Lee. They both appear to be reporting CHANGES in lung function not absolute values. The problem as mentioned below is that changes tend to have a different SD from the final values and SMD becomes a problem as outlined below. Have you tried to contact the authors of the Lin Lee study to ask for % predicted PEF after treatment (mean and SD) for all 80 patients who were randomised into the two trials that they carried out ? There may be a similar problem with the Kress study, but I see you report in the text that you have verified the data with the authors of this study.&lt;br&gt;I have made some minor changes to the wording of the review in red.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;21062006&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attached the final version of the review. With regard to the Chris comments:&lt;br&gt;1. The lung function tests pooled are final absolute values or % of predicted; we did not use changes from baseline.&lt;br&gt;2. I tested subgroups (methodological quality) difference and modified conclusions accordingly.&lt;br&gt;3. The same for baseline severity.&lt;br&gt;4. I modified the hospital admissions RR from random to a fixed model.&lt;br&gt;5. Also heart rate (from fixed to random model).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gustavo J. Rodrigo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 14/6/06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Could you confirm that the lung function tests that have been pooled are either ALL change from baseline or ALL absolute values. SMD cannot be used to combine absolute with change scores as the SD of change scores is smaller so the unit of measurement is not the same!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. RESULTS OF SUBGROUPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Conversely, when we compared studies stratified by methodological quality, a significant improvement favouring high quality studies was found (again, it was a heterogeneous result).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct way to test between subgroups is described by Altman in the BMJ 2003;36:219 - Statistics Notes: Interaction revisited: the difference between two estimates. The two subgroups need to be compared to each other using a t-test from the point estimate and the two confidence intervals (as RevMan does for the two arms of each trial). For methodological quality this gives a between group difference of 0.48 (95% CI 1.08 to -0.12) which is not significant. If you would like a copy of an excel spreadsheet to carry out these calculations I am happy to send you one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are correct that &amp;quot;There were no significant differences between groups when we compared adults versus children, high dose versus low heliox dose and breath heliox versus nebulized with heliox (see MetaView graphs).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For severity this test shows a significant difference between the severe and less severe subgroups - group difference -0.59 (-0.06 to -1.12, P 0.029) on the SMD using the random effects results in view of the heterogeneity that you point out. Although this is significant there is a danger of regression to the mean here. Subgtouping by using lung function tests and then using the results from the same tests are not trustworthy for this reason. It must be reported cautiously with this in mind and be regarded as no more than hypothesis generating (as suggested in implications for further research).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &amp;quot;There was a marginal statistically significant reduction in admission to hospital in favour of heliox (RR = 0.77; 95%CI: 0.60 to 1.00).&amp;quot; Using Relative Risk and a fixed effect model, as there is no heterogeneity, the RR is 0.83 (0.66 to 1.08) which is NOT significant. It is also not significant when tested using Odds Ratios. This result does not achieve significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &amp;quot;with the exception of heart rate which indicated that heliox increased bpm by a mean of 7.67 (95% CI: 0.79 to 14.55)&amp;quot; This is a fixed method result and is not appropriate with the high heterogeneity reported. The random result is not significant and should be reported as such please.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;June 7, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice work on the revision. See edits below:&lt;br&gt;1) I have accepted your highlighted changes;&lt;br&gt;2) I have added a few edits in red;&lt;br&gt;3) I think its becoming standard to just report the I2 for heterogeneity, so I deleted the chi-square and p values;&lt;br&gt;4) I think its becoming standard to just report the 95% CI for results, so I deleted the p-values;&lt;br&gt;5) I inserted the appropriate symbols (for kappa and Chi-square) and subscripts/superscripts as appropriate.&lt;br&gt;6) We became a Department, so I changed Division to Department in the funding.&lt;br&gt;7) Please confirm that the Dorfman admission data are correct - they look bizarre. &lt;br&gt;8) Comparison 02.04 looks better with another scale (0.001-1000).&lt;br&gt;9) The SDs for the SaO2 data appear to me to be SEM (very small). Can you confirm they are SDs and not SEMs?&lt;br&gt;10) I've added a funnel plot figure, which suggests a publication bias. Care to comment?&lt;br&gt;11) You need to be careful when saying thesubgroups are different. Chris may have some comments about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authors and contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Please fill in the What's new section (under Cover sheet to let the reader know what has changed in the update such as the names of new studies and any changes in results and interpretation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Please indicate if the studies are parallel design in the first column. Also what were the withdrawal rates, was there ITT analysis? How was allocation concealed in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There seem to be some major issues here. The active treatment must be entered in the first column in RevMan and the labels should then reflect this above the groups. The graph labels on the other hand need to be reversed for good outcomes. COULD YOU CONFIRM HOW THE DATA HAS BEEN ENTERED AND CHANGE THIS TO MATCH THE ABOVE CONVENTIONS? I suspect that the wrong labels have been altered, you need to change back the labels on the first screen when you edit an outcome and change the GRAPH labels on the third screen instead!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE AN UNLIKELY SD IN THE FIRST COLUMN FOR 1#5 airways resistance for the KASS study. Is this a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The cross-over study should just include first arm data; if you do not have it leave it out of the analysis as RevMan cannot weight cross-overs properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Final sentence removed : &amp;quot;These results should be added to current guidelines for acute asthma management.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; - we are not in a position to say that guidelines should adopt the review conclusions!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Final sentence removed from results : &amp;quot;However, the studies that used heliox to deliver nebulized therapy showed a trend towards an increase in pulmonary function suggesting that heliox could be more effective than oxygen/air in delivering inhaled particles of beta-agonists to distal airways.&amp;quot; In my view speculation based on non-significant trends should not be regarded as a result!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Sentence removed from Methods: &amp;quot;A quality weighting procedure will be used, where a quality weight is given to the studies based on the scores, and that way, the robustness of the estimate can be assessed.&amp;quot; Metaview does not incorporate weighting in relation to quality. Do you mean that you will do a quality assessment and use it for sensitivity analysis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;RESULTS:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Please insert a short description of the new studies found for this update (put in links and additional number of patients included?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS we are now using RevMan 4.1 (change throughout:&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent back to Toby for authors to review the above (especially data entry and Metaview labels please).&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;I agree with Chris's comments. Mine are below:&lt;br&gt;1)Some changes in CAPS and **** in text;&lt;br&gt;2)The CAG prefer randomised to randomized (I changed them throughout);&lt;br&gt;3)Abstract: &amp;quot;studies designde to washout.. &amp;quot; replaced with &amp;quot;studies&lt;br&gt;designed to washout ...&amp;quot;;&lt;br&gt;4)Jadad 1995 is actually Jada 1996 (Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carrol D, et al.&lt;br&gt;Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: Is blinding&lt;br&gt;necessary? Contr Clin Trials 1996;17:1-12). I have changed this in the&lt;br&gt;review.&lt;br&gt;5)Methods: &amp;quot;Review Manager (version 4.0.4)&amp;quot; changed to &amp;quot;Review Manager&lt;br&gt;(Version 4.1)&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;6)Stats: &amp;quot; ...with 95% CI&amp;quot; changed to &amp;quot;..with 95% confidence intervals&lt;br&gt;(CI).&amp;quot;;&lt;br&gt;7)Results: there is a lot of repetition. Please see ***'ed area after&lt;br&gt;first paragraph. &lt;br&gt;8)Results (paragraph 2): change&amp;quot; measurements made breathing....&amp;quot; to&lt;br&gt;...measurements made WHILE breathing ...;&lt;br&gt;9) Results (paragraph 3): &amp;quot;Like pulmonary function..&amp;quot; changed to &amp;quot;Similar&lt;br&gt;to the pulmonary function results, ...&amp;quot;;&lt;br&gt;10)(SMD = 7.67; 95%CI: 0.79 to 14.55) doesn't need a p-value.&lt;br&gt;11)Implications for research: Do you really feel that &amp;quot;Most importantly,&lt;br&gt;larger and more definitive controlled studies are needed to clarify the&lt;br&gt;efficacy.&amp;quot; I find it hard to justify this when there are better treatments&lt;br&gt;available.&lt;br&gt;12)Finally, the assistance of Professor Paul Jones (CAG Coordinating&lt;br&gt;Editor) and Chris Cates (CAG Criticism Editor) was greatly appreciated.&lt;br&gt;13)Need to mention Toby and Karen: The authors wish to acknowledge the&lt;br&gt;assistance of Toby Lasserson and Karen Blackhall of the Cochrane Airways&lt;br&gt;Group (CAG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gustavo,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have edited the full review and have made the following changes:&lt;br&gt;1)Spelling mistakes corrected throughout (mixtured --&amp;gt; mixture; taht --&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;that; nebulzed --&amp;gt; nebulised; etc).&lt;br&gt;2)Changed all randomiZed to randomised (as stated in the last suggestions,&lt;br&gt;this is the Cochrane convention).&lt;br&gt;3)In Clinical Implications: I have revised this to say: &amp;quot;At this time,&lt;br&gt;there is insufficient evidence to support the role of heliox in the initial&lt;br&gt;treatment of acute asthma patients&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;4)Changed all randomiZed to randomised in Excluded trials section.&lt;br&gt;5)Throughout you use PEFR and PEF. I have changed them ALL to PEF for&lt;br&gt;consistency;&lt;br&gt;6)Some spelling mistakes in Included study table corrected.&lt;br&gt;7) Dyspnea is spelled dispnea, dyspnea and dyspnoea - I have corrected all&lt;br&gt;to &amp;quot;dyspnea&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;8)I have put in my support into the first section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining issues is the one Chris and I have repeatedly brought up.&lt;br&gt;Adding FEV-1 and PEF together is not traditionally accepted by Paul and the&lt;br&gt;CAG. It appears this is still being done; however, if that is not being&lt;br&gt;done, please advise. Chris can you reconfirm that this is the approach we&lt;br&gt;want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will discuss this with Paul and get back to Brian. Possibly remove Kress from the data set and change SMD in the text for this as it is a change in FEV1 and not comparable with the other PEF and % PEF data.&lt;br&gt;Metaview labels checked and 2~2 changed labels.&lt;br&gt;CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28/1/2003&lt;br&gt;After discussion with Paul today, we felt that it is reasonable to combine PEF and FEV if all the results are either change from baseline (absolute or %) or final value. I would be grateful, therefore, if the details of the data entered into RevMan could be made explicit for each study. It would help readers if this went in the text of the review as well, since there is no way of telling from the Metaview table what data is actually entered. As we have to use SMD the results critically depend on the SD so if this has been estimated in any papers could this also be made explicit.&lt;br&gt;I have checked the Rose data and see it is final FEV1 with SD from the paper, but I cannot see how the Kress mean and SD have been derived from the paper. I look forward to clarification of the data used.&lt;br&gt;If there are a mixture of change and final scores these will need to be separated as different sub-groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;22 AUg 2003 Update for editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;What's new needs original dates for protocol and review please.&lt;br&gt;P value for heterogeneity of lung function corrected to p= 0.62&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Three studies included PEF (% predicted) ( Carter 1996; Kass 1999; Dorfman 2000), two studies reported PEF (L/min) (Henderson 1999;Rose 2002), and one study included FEV1 (L) (Kress 2002). &amp;quot; I have changed this to match the data in Metaview - Rose appears to l/min not % predicted. &lt;br&gt;I am happy for Kress to be included as these appear to be absolute FEV1 results obtained from the authors.&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Heliox for nonintubated acute asthma patients&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-05 16:18:08 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="HOX-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 16:16:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Acute asthma is a common disease presentation to the emergency department (ED) in many countries. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and arresting airway inflammation. The main agents employed to treat acute asthma include combined treatments with bronchodilating agents and corticosteroids. However, there is evidence that helium and oxygen mixtures (heliox) may provide additional benefits to patients with acute asthma. This review examines the evidence from ten<B> </B>randomised controlled trials involving 544 patients which compared heliox to oxygen or air, when used in conjunction with the other standard acute treatments. The reviewers conclude that the evidence does not support routine use of heliox in patients with acute asthma.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-08-25 11:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Helium and oxygen mixtures (heliox), have been used sporadically in respiratory medicine for decades. Their use in acute respiratory emergencies such as asthma has been the subject of considerable debate. Despite the lapse of more than 60 years since it was first proposed, the role of heliox in treating patients with severe acute asthma remains unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of the addition of heliox to standard medical care on the course of acute asthma, as measured by pulmonary function testing and clinical endpoints.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-08-25 11:18:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. In addition, we contacted primary authors and experts and searched reference lists of articles. Searches are current to August 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-08-25 11:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>1) Randomised, single or double blind, controlled trials; 2) children or adults with a clinical diagnosis of acute asthma seen in emergency departments or equivalent acute care settings; and 3) compared treatment with inhaled heliox to placebo (oxygen or air).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and quality assessment; disagreement was resolved by a third review author and consensus. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-19 09:21:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review includes a total of ten<B> </B>trials involving 544<B> </B>acute asthma patients. Seven studies involved adults and three<B> </B>studies dealt solely with children. Three were assessed as high quality (Jadad score &gt; 3). Pulmonary function tests were recorded during heliox administration (15 to 60 min). Pooling of the eight trials contributing data to this review showed no significant group differences (standardised mean differences -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to 0.01). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies. Heliox use did improve pulmonary function only in the subgroup of patients with the most severe baseline pulmonary function impairment; however, this conclusion is based on a small number of studies. There were no significant differences between groups when adults versus children, and high versus low heliox dose studies were compared. Finally, at the end of treatment, participants treated with heliox showed no significant different risk of admission to hospital (RR 0.83 (95%CI 0.66 to 1.08, P = 0.17, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The existing evidence does not provide support for the administration of helium-oxygen mixtures to all ED patients with acute asthma. At this time, heliox treatment does not have a role to play in the initial treatment of patients with acute asthma. Nevertheless, new evidence suggests certain beneficial effects in patients with more severe obstruction. Since these conclusions are based upon between-group comparisons and small studies, they should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 16:17:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Helium and oxygen mixtures (heliox), have been used sporadically in respiratory medicine for decades. For example, as early as 1935 heliox was introduced to the medical community for treatment of upper and lower airway obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Barach-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barach 1935</LINK>). The interest in heliox for treatment of asthma became prominent in the 1980's when deaths from asthma began to rise. Due to their low density with respect to air (80% helium/20% oxygen mixture has a density approximately one third that of air), heliox mixtures have the potential to decrease airway resistance and therefore decrease work of breathing in those situations associated with increased airway resistance. Thus, they may provide benefit to patients suffering from obstructive lesions of the larynx, trachea, and airways. Additionally, research using a heliox mixture, has demonstrated a greater percentage of lung particle retention (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1993</LINK>). This suggests that one of the beneficial effects of heliox use in reactive airway diseases may be improved deposition of aerosolized bronchodilators in ventilated acute asthma patients (<LINK REF="REF-Goode-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goode 2001</LINK>). Heliox has also been recommended as a useful adjunct in the adult patient with severe asthma, both during spontaneous ventilation as well as during mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Shiue-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shiue 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gluck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gluck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manthous-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Manthous 1995</LINK>). Conversely, other research has concluded that the inhaled mass of albuterol decreased significantly when a nebulizer was powered with heliox rather than air (<LINK REF="REF-Hess-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 1999</LINK>). Reports describing the use of heliox in children with asthma also provide conflicting results, with some failing (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1996</LINK>) and others showing a benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Kudukis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kudukis 1997</LINK>). However, much of the evidence arises from either small trials or uncontrolled studies. Fortunately, larger trials comparing the effectiveness of heliox to oxygen for beta-agonist therapy have recently been performed (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>In summary, much is unknown regarding the use of heliox in acute asthma. First, without controlled studies, the effect of heliox is difficult to assess. Second, the duration of administration and optimal helium/oxygen mixture remain undetermined. Finally, the cost of treatment is relatively high and the number needed to treat for an acceptable benefit has not been established. Given the above controversies, the need for a systematic review exists. Prior to the publication of the first version if this review in 2002, no systematic reviews on this topic had been published, and it is not surprising that heliox use is variable and institution specific. Despite the lapse of more than 60 years since its use was first proposed, the role of heliox in treating patients with acute severe asthma is unclear. </P>

<P>We identified trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details). All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'asthma' were searched using the following terms:</P>

<P>Titles, abstracts, and citations were independently reviewed by the two reviewers (GR, CR) to assess potential relevance for full review. From the full text, both reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion based on the criteria for population, intervention, study design and outcomes. Agreement was measured using kappa statistics and any disagreement over study inclusion was resolved by a third reviewer (CVP) and consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (GR,CR) assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using two methods. First, using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment: 1) Grade A: Adequate concealment 2) Grade B: Uncertain 3) Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment. Second, each study was assessed for validity on a 0-5 scale, method developed by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Inter-rater reliability was measured for both quality scales by using kappa statistics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (GR, CR) independently extracted data from included trials and entered results into the Cochrane Collaboration software program (Review Manager 5). Data extraction included the following items: 1) population: age, gender, number of patients studied, patient demographics, withdrawals; 2) Intervention: agent, dose, route of delivery, and duration of therapy; 3) control: concurrent treatments; 4) outcomes; and 5) design: method of randomisation and allocation concealment.</P>

<P>All included trials were combined using Review Manager 5. For continuous variables, the results of individual studies were calculated as a random-effects weighted mean (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To adjust for differences in baseline spirometric measures between the control and treatment groups, the baseline difference between groups was added to the control group at the time of outcome assessment. The contribution of each trial to the pooled estimate was proportional to the inverse of the variance. Homogeneity of effect sizes were tested with the Dersimonian and Laird method with P &lt; 0.1 as the cut point for significance.<B> </B>We also measured heterogeneity by using the I-squared test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Values of 25%, 50% and 75% represent low, moderate and high heterogeneity respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed using: age (adults versus children), different helium-oxygen mixtures (80/20, versus 70/30 or 60/40), methodological quality (concealment Grade A versus other Grades; Jadad score (&gt; 3 versus &#8804; 3) and the method of heliox use (studies designed to washout air in the lungs and replace it with heliox versus studies that used heliox to deliver nebulized therapy). Finally, differences between estimates were tested according to methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Altman-and-Bland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman and Bland 2003</LINK>.<BR/>

<P>The initial search produced 94 potentially relevant citations. Of these, 13 studies were reviewed in full text for possible inclusion, all identified from the literature search. Five studies were excluded because they were non-randomised trials and one because it included out-of-hospital patients (<LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Her-2000" TYPE="STUDY">L'Her 2000</LINK>). One randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kudukis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kudukis 1997</LINK>) was not included. There were a number of reasons for this: 1) The primary outcome measure was pulsus paradoxus; 2) FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and PEF data could not be obtained from the authors; 3) an unvalidated "dyspnoea score" was used; this was composed of: SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, inspired FIO<SUB>2</SUB>, inspiratory breath sounds, accessory muscle use, expiratory wheeze and cerebral function, and 4) SaO<SUB>2</SUB> data were provided; however, it was unclear what FIO<SUB>2</SUB> when those measurements were made. After two updates (2002 and 2006), a<B> </B>total of ten randomised controlled trials (544 participants) were selected for inclusion (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

Eight studies were conducted in North America, one in Taiwan, and one in China. The studies enrolled patients with mild to severe reductions in the mean pulmonary function measures at presentation.

<P>Eight trials examined response to treatment using pulmonary function tests.

In one study SD were estimated from SEM (<LINK REF="STD-Kass-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1999</LINK>) and in another trial FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (L) and SD were estimated and confirmed by authors (<LINK REF="STD-Kress-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kress 2002</LINK>). There do appear to be unresolved issues concerning PEF measurements in patients breathing helium-oxygen mixtures, because helium is lighter than nitrogen. In one of the papers included here (<LINK REF="STD-Kass-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1999</LINK>), PEF was measured with a peak flow meter and the authors did not report correction for gas density. By contrast, in a study that was not included here (<LINK REF="STD-Kudukis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kudukis 1997</LINK>), PEF measurements made while breathing heliox needed to be corrected by a factor of 1.32 when measured using a Wright Peak Flow Meter. Spirometers were used for the other four trials in this review which should not require correction since they are volumetric devices. Pooling of the eight trials contributing data to this review showed no significant group differences (SMD -0.28; 95% CI -0.56 to 0.01, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However this effect showed heterogeneity between the studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 45.8%). There were no significant differences between groups when we compared adults versus children, high dose versus low heliox dose and breath heliox versus nebulized with heliox (<I>see </I>MetaView graphs). When we compared studies stratified by methodological quality, high quality studies showed a significant improvement in pulmonary function (SMD -0.56; 95%CI -1.04 to -0.08); however, there was no statistically significant difference when the high and low quality subgroups were compared with each other (SMD -0.46; 95%CI-2.12 to 1.20). Finally, the three studies with a moderate to severe decrease in baseline pulmonary function showed a significant difference compared with the five studies with a mild-moderate decrease (SMD 0.61;95%CI 0.21 to 1.00). Statistical heterogeneity remained, albeit to a lower degree (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 27.2%); however, with subgroup comparisons based on baseline pulmonary function, there is a danger of regression to the mean.</P>
<P>With regard to additional outcomes, seven studies reported admission to hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kress-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kress 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-Lee-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin Lee 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2006</LINK>), five reported dyspnoea or pulmonary index<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2006</LINK>), four reported heart rate (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kress-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kress 2002</LINK>), and three reported oxygen saturation (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2002</LINK>). There was no significant reduction in admission to hospital in favour of heliox (RR 0.83; 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08, <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). This effect was statistically homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). There were no significant differences between groups in the remaining secondary variables (dyspnoea, heart rate and oxygen saturation). Two studies reported need for mechanical ventilation; there were no intubations in the first (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1999</LINK>) and one patient in the control group required endotracheal intubation in the second (<LINK REF="STD-Kass-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 1999</LINK>). Finally, adverse effects were reported in two trials. In the <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1999</LINK> study, one patient became hypoxic while receiving the 70:30 heliox mix, and the <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 2000</LINK> study reported only one heliox-treated patient that experienced dizziness during the intervention. Overall, heliox appears to be safe and well tolerated in the mixtures used in these studies to treat acute asthma.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-25 11:28:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review has attempted to incorporate the best available evidence on heliox use in patients with acute asthma. We found ten randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials that compared heliox to other forms of standard care. Several important conclusions arise from the analysis. Firstly, the addition of heliox to standard medical care during the course of acute asthma was not found to be more effective than a comparison delivery with air or oxygen. The overall pooled analysis reveals that there are not significant differences between groups. Furthermore, the point estimate is associated with narrow confidence intervals, including clinically unimportant changes. These results are similar irrespective of the age (children versus adults), methodological quality (high versus low) and mixture of heliox (e.g. high or low helium-oxygen mixtures). However, the studies characterised by moderate to severe pulmonary function impairment showed a significant improvement compared with the studies with mild to moderate pulmonary function impairment. These findings suggest that heliox could be more effective than oxygen/air in delivering inhaled particles of beta-agonists to distal airways, particularly in the most severe patients. Lastly, there was insufficient information to pool other outcomes or side effects, so no firm conclusions regarding adverse effects cannot be drawn. In one study one patient became hypoxic while receiving the 70:30 heliox mixture. Overall, heliox appears to be safe and well tolerated in the mixtures used in these studies to treat acute asthma.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>Our analysis is subject to the general problems of meta-analysis. There is a possibility of publication bias in this meta-analysis. For example, by missing unpublished trials we may be providing an inaccurate estimation of the effect of heliox treatment. However, a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant studies was conducted, using a systematic strategy to avoid bias. This was followed by attempts to contact corresponding and first authors. Despite these efforts the funnel plot (for admissions) appears asymmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There was no statistical heterogeneity for this outcome, and the 'outlying' study with the point estimate favouring control was available as a letter to a journal (<LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 2000</LINK>). We cannot exclude the possibility that other negative, unpublished studies exist which would alter the pooled effect estimate. There is also a possibility of study selection bias; however, we employed two independent review authors, and feel confident that the studies excluded were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons.</P>
<P>Like all systematic reviews, this meta-analysis is limited by the quality of existing research and how the data are reported. Only three of ten included trials were considered "high quality". In fact,<B> </B>comparison of trials with high methodological quality to low did affect the conclusions. Nevertheless, the number and size of studies included remains small. So, the current conclusions may be modified by the publication of results from larger trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>The existing evidence fails to demonstrate a clear benefit from the administration of helium-oxygen mixtures to all ED patients with acute asthma.</LI>
<LI>Treatment with heliox may improve pulmonary function in the most severe acute asthma patients; however, clinicians must ensure other evidence-based treatments are employed.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-25 11:30:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Questions regarding the treatment of acute asthma with heliox remain unanswered:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Additional studies are needed to confirm the sub-group findings from this review suggesting a beneficial effect of heliox in severe acute asthma. In future studies, severity must be clearly defined and based on presenting pulmonary function results and response to initial beta-agonist therapy whenever possible.</LI>
<LI>Studies involving very young children need to be performed to determine the effect of heliox in this age group</LI>
<LI>Further studies are required to examine the effect of heliox based on the prior inhaled steroid use in patients presenting to the ED with an asthma exacerbation. The effect of treatment may differ based on inhaled steroid use, and the answer to this question remains unclear. Inhaled steroids are increasingly employed and the development of high dose inhaled steroids with lower systemic activity suggests that this would be an important area for future research.</LI>
<LI>Future research on acute asthma must concentrate on well defined outcomes which may lead to more informative reviews. More specifically, criteria for discharge and reporting of lung function test data in a systematic fashion would assist in further work. Finally, better description of the methodology would also be beneficial.</LI>
