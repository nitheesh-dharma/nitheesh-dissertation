<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>More than one in five of breast cancer patients will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL is a swelling that can occur in the arm, breast, or chest wall as a result of breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy. BCRL can negatively impact comfort, function, and quality of life</P>
<P>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a hands-on therapy that is commonly used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT consists of MLD, compression bandaging, lymph-reducing exercises (LREs), and skin care.</P>
<P>
<B>The Review Questions</B>
</P>
<P>Is MLD safe and effective in treating BCRL?</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found six trials published through May, 2013, totaling 208 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results </B>
</P>
<P>When women were treated with a course of intensive compression bandaging, their swelling went down about 30% to 37%. When MLD was added to the intensive course of compression bandaging, their swelling went down another 7.11%. Thus, MLD may offer benefit when added to compression bandaging.</P>
<P>Examining this finding more closely showed that this significant reduction benefit was observed in people with mild-to-moderate lymphedema when compared to participants with moderate-to-severe lymphedema. Thus, our findings suggest that individuals with mild-to-moderate BCRL are the ones who may benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by further research.</P>
<P>When women were given a standard elastic compression sleeve plus MLD and compared to women who received a standard compression sleeve plus a nonMLD treatment, results were mixed (sometimes favoring MLD and sometimes favoring neither treatment.)</P>
<P>One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve.</P>
<P>MLD is safe and well tolerated.</P>
<P>Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), with one trial showing benefit and the other not. Two trials measured quality of life, but neither trial presented results comparing the treatment group to the control, so findings are inconclusive.</P>
<P>No trial measured cost of care.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-05-14 16:00:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-14 14:02:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>More than one in five patients who undergo treatment for breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL can occur as a result of breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy<I>.</I> BCRL can negatively impact comfort, function, and quality of life (QoL). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a type of hands-on therapy, is frequently used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is a fourfold conservative treatment which includes MLD, compression therapy (consisting of compression bandages, compression sleeves, or other types of compression garments), skin care, and lymph-reducing exercises (LREs). Phase 1 of CDT is to reduce swelling; Phase 2 is to maintain the reduced swelling.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-25 12:50:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of MLD in treating BCRL.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-05-30 05:43:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform), and Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register from root to 24 May 2013. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:23:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with BCRL. The intervention was MLD. The primary outcomes were (1) volumetric changes, (2) adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (1) function, (2) subjective sensations, (3) QoL, (4) cost of care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-07 19:59:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We collected data on three volumetric outcomes. (1) LE (lymphedema) volume was defined as the amount of excess fluid left in the arm after treatment, calculated as volume in mL of affected arm post-treatment minus unaffected arm post-treatment. (2) Volume reduction was defined as the amount of fluid reduction in mL from before to after treatment calculated as the pretreatment LE volume of the affected arm minus the post-treatment LE volume of the affected arm. (3) Per cent reduction was defined as the proportion of fluid reduced relative to the baseline excess volume, calculated as volume reduction divided by baseline LE volume multiplied by 100. We entered trial data into Review Manger 5.2 (RevMan), pooled data using a fixed-effect model, and analyzed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also explored subgroups to determine whether mild BCRL compared to moderate or severe BCRL, and BCRL less than a year compared to more than a year was associated with a better response to MLD.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 16:00:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Six trials were included. Based on similar designs, trials clustered in three categories.</P>
<P>(1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy (one trial) showed significant improvements in both groups from baseline but no significant between-groups differences for per cent reduction.</P>
<P>(2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging (two trials) showed significant per cent reductions of 30% to 38.6% for compression bandaging alone, and an additional 7.11% reduction for MLD (MD 7.11%, 95% CI 1.75% to 12.47%; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.06). LE volume was not significant. Subgroup analyses was significant showing that participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL were better responders to MLD than were moderate-to-severe participants.</P>
<P>(3) MLD + compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment + compression therapy (three trials) were too varied to pool. One of the trials compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus pneumatic pump. Volume reduction was statistically significant favoring MLD (MD 47.00 mL, 95% CI 15.25 mL to 78.75 mL; 1 RCT; 24 participants), per cent reduction was borderline significant (P=0.07), and LE volume was not significant. A second trial compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus self-administered simple lymphatic drainage (SLD), and was significant for MLD for LE volume (MD -230.00 mL, 95% CI -450.84 mL to -9.16 mL; 1 RCT; 31 participants) but not for volume reduction or per cent reduction. A third trial of MLD + compression bandaging versus SLD + compression bandaging was not significant (P = 0.10) for per cent reduction, the only outcome measured (MD 11.80%, 95% CI -2.47% to 26.07%, 28 participants).</P>
<P>MLD was well tolerated and safe in all trials.</P>
<P>Two trials measured function as range of motion with conflicting results. One trial reported significant within-groups gains for both groups, but no between-groups differences. The other trial reported there were no significant within-groups gains and did not report between-groups results. One trial measured strength and reported no significant changes in either group.</P>
<P>Two trials measured QoL, but results were not usable because one trial did not report any results, and the other trial did not report between-groups results.</P>
<P>Four trials measured sensations such as pain and heaviness. Overall, the sensations were significantly reduced in both groups over baseline, but with no between-groups differences. No trials reported cost of care.</P>
<P>Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:00:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>MLD is safe and may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for swelling reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate-to-severe BCRL, those with mild-to-moderate BCRL may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by randomized data.</P>
<P>In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared with a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial. Research is needed to identify the most clinically meaningful volumetric measurement, to incorporate newer technologies in LE assessment, and to assess other clinically relevant outcomes such as fibrotic tissue formation.</P>
<P>Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), and inconclusive for quality of life.</P>
<P>For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, 60% to 80% of participants reported feeling better regardless of which treatment they received.</P>
<P>One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-14 14:03:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>More than one in five women with breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) (<LINK REF="REF-DiSipio-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiSipio 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paskett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paskett 2012</LINK>). BCRL is an abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid in the tissues on the affected side of the body following breast cancer treatment as a result of surgical procedures and/or radiation therapy. Breast cancer surgery can cause lymphedema through several mechanisms: surgical removal of lymphatic structures such as nodes and vessels can impair lymph carrying capacity. Surgical scarring can diminish lymph transport by occlusion of lymph vessels and/or loss of elasticity in lymph vessels. Surgical removal or damage of muscle tissue can diminish the muscle&#8217;s compressive force on the lymph vessels and impair the "muscle pump" (<LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2013</LINK>). Radiation therapy can also cause BCRL through several mechanisms including direct tissue damage, node damage, and/or scarring and fibrosis, all reducing lymph carrying capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although recent changes in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer (such as sentinel node biopsy, changes in radiation therapy, and less invasive surgical techniques due to earlier diagnosis) have reduced the risk of BCRL, BCRL remains a major problem for women with breast cancer. Six-month prevalence rates, for any six months within a three-year window, have been estimated at 23% to 29% (<LINK REF="REF-Paskett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paskett 2007</LINK>). Prospective incidence rates of BCRL range between 20% to 40% for the first three years following breast cancer surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Armer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 2003</LINK>). Incidence rates vary according to the type of breast cancer treatment received, with women who receive both axillary radiation and axillary lymph node resection showing the highest incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors for BCRL include higher stage of breast cancer, higher number of lymph nodes removed, obesity, poorer performance status, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Helyer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helyer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miaskowski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miaskowski 2013</LINK>) and certain genes (<LINK REF="REF-Miaskowski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miaskowski 2013</LINK>). Exercise such as strength training has been associated with lower risk of BCRL (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swenson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swenson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>BCRL can affect the arm, hand, fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, breast, chest or any combination of these areas. Arm BCRL is the most widely studied and is classified according to the excess volume of the affected arm compared to the unaffected arm. A common arm classification is mild (&lt; 20% excess volume), moderate (20% to 40% excess volume) and severe (&gt; 40% excess volume) (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2010</LINK>). Arm BCRL is often not diagnosed until the patient, herself, notices subtle signs of swelling such as the inability to wear rings or watches, or has symptoms such as discomfort, heaviness or tightness in the limb or region. In some cases the skin may appear shiny, veins may be less visible, and tissue may feel firmer than normal.</P>
<P>Truncal BCRL (chest, axilla, shoulder, breast and/or upper back) has not been as well documented as arm BCRL (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1996</LINK>) but is also associated with physical and psychological sequelae. Truncal BCRL may be assessed with skin fold calipers, tissue dielectric constant, ultrasonic skin thickness measurement or bioimpedance. However, visual observation remains the most practical assessment of truncal lymphedema: for example, asymmetry, bra strap and seam indentations, orange peel phenomenon, changes in skin color, palpation of tissue texture and skin folds between affected and non-affected side. Truncal BCRL may present with or without arm BCRL and visa versa (<LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2010b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the excess fluid build up, BCRL can create considerable disability, pain (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1996</LINK>), limited motion, heaviness, numbness, psychosocial morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Mirolo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirolo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passik-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passik 1998</LINK>), and diminished quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1993</LINK>). Left untreated, BCRL can progress, and the skin over the affected area can lose its elasticity; and the person can become prone to repeated infections and fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK>). However, early detection and treatment of BCRL can both reduce lymphatic swelling and maintain that reduction over time (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2012</LINK>). Thus, altering the progression of this potentially disabling condition through effective early intervention is important.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-14 14:03:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a light but very specific hands-on therapy designed to reduce lymph swelling by enhancing lymphatic drainage. MLD therapists are trained in the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system to facilitate lymph drainage of the vessels. MLD is sometimes administered alone, but often is administered as part of a fourfold conservative treatment known as complex decongestive therapy (CDT). The four components of CDT are MLD, compression therapy, lymph-reducing exercises and skin care.</P>
<P>CDT is the most common treatment for many types of lymphedema and involves two phases. In Phase 1, which lasts two to four weeks, the goal is to reduce the swelling through MLD and compression bandaging. The therapist also instructs the patient on good skin care practices to ensure the skin remains healthy and free of infection and prescribes specialized lymph-reducing exercises. Modifications of CDT can involve replacing the compression bandaging with a compression sleeve (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Phase 2, after the limb is sufficiently reduced in volume, the patient is then fitted with a compression garment (<LINK REF="REF-Foldi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foldi 1998</LINK>). In Phase 2, the goal is to maintain the volume reductions achieved in Phase 1 through self-administered compressive therapy, lymph-reducing exercises, and self-lymphatic drainage. MLD is generally not prescribed in Phase 2 unless needed; however, there is evidence to suggest that many participants continue with maintenance MLD in addition to self-massage (<LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2012</LINK>). Also, the patient continues with skin care.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, "compression therapy" is used to describe the compression part of the lymphedema therapy, whether it is bandaging, sleeve, or custom-fitted garment. Many studies have shown that the compression therapy part of the CDT, usually beginning with compression bandaging and then later through a compression sleeve, can effectively reduce swelling. CDT is used synonymously in the medical literature with complete decongestive physiotherapy or decongestive lymphatic therapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:07:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Under normal conditions, the body&#8217;s circulation results in fluid exchange at the arterial side of the capillaries into the interstitial space. Most of this interstitial fluid is returned into the circulation by the venous ends of the capillaries. The remaining interstitial fluid along with protein molecules, bacteria, viruses, and waste products are picked up by small lymph vessels and becomes lymphatic fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2013</LINK>). The research of <LINK REF="REF-Levick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levick 2010</LINK> suggests that tissue fluid balance is critically dependent on lymphatic function in most tissues.</P>
<P>The lymphatic fluid is carried to larger lymph vessels, and eventually is emptied back into the venous circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Lawenda-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawenda 2009</LINK>). The lymphatic fluid is not &#8216;pumped&#8217; through the body by a central pump like the heart; rather, it is moved by the rhythmic contractions of the muscular walls of lymphangions, which are segmented portions of the lymph vessels separated by a valve on either side. The sequential, segment-to-segment contractions of the lymphangions are under the control of the autonomic nervous system, but can be augmented by external stimuli on the lymphatics, such as from compression of surrounding muscles and filamentary support structures or local arterial pulsation. When damage occurs to the lymphatic system, drainage of interstitial fluid may become compromised. The resulting lymph stasis causes a build up of interstitial fluid or the condition known as &#8216;lymphedema&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<I>MLD </I>is a type of specialized manual therapy based on the anatomy of the lymph system. It is believed to work by enhancing movement of lymph fluid, decreasing interstitial fluid, and softening fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2007</LINK>). It is proposed that MLD can 'assist nature' by stimulating the natural peristaltic contractions of the lymphangions (<LINK REF="REF-Mislin-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mislin 1961</LINK>). Thus MLD reduces swelling by stimulating lymphangion pumping, reducing hydrostatic resistance to lymph flow, and rerouting lymph away from areas of stasis and into viable lymphatic vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Leduc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leduc 1998</LINK>). The ability of MLD to reduce lymphatic swelling has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because MLD is frequently administered as part of CDT, the other three components of CDT are briefly described below.</P>
<P>C<I>ompression therapy</I> helps reduce interstitial fluid by decreasing its formation and preventing lymph back flow into the interstitial space (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2007</LINK>). Compression also assists the pumping action of muscles by creating a resistance against which muscles can work. This is called the "muscle pump" effect. Compression therapy in Phase 1 is usually done using multi-layered compression bandaging<I>,</I> which consists of gauze for wrapping the fingers and hand, a stockinette sleeve which protects the skin, soft cotton wrap or high density foam and two to three layers of short-stretch bandaging. Short-stretch bandages are used so that as the limb is moved, the muscles contract against the resistance of the inelastic bandages. Distinct variations within the sub-bandage pressures can enhance lymphatic and venous function. Compression therapy in Phase 2 of CDT is designed to maintain the volume reductions from the first phase, and may be achieved by use of a compression sleeve or custom-fitted garment, with or without a glove or hand gauntlet that is worn during the day. In some cases, compression bandages are worn at night.</P>
<P>
<I>Lymph-reducing exercises </I>aim specifically at promoting lymph flow and reducing swelling. These exercises involve "active, repetitive, non-resistive motion of the involved body part" and "are similar to some movements of low impact Tai Chi and Qigong" and always done "with compression on the involved extremity" (<LINK REF="REF-NLN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLN 2011</LINK>). The compression allows the muscles to contract against resistance creating a more effective "muscle pump" which enhances lymphatic and venous return. Examples of lymph-reducing exercises are available on the web (<LINK REF="REF-Zuther-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuther 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Skin Care.</I> People with BCRL are at increased risk of skin infection because the swelling from BCRL stretches the skin putting it at increased risk of injury. Furthermore, the high protein content of lymphatic fluid serves as a medium where bacteria may thrive causing a skin infection known as cellulitis. Cellulitis can spread to deeper tissues and/or systemically through the body. Thus, in skin care education, participants learn how to keep the skin supple and protected from breaks and tears, and how and why to use pH-neutral creams or lotions, and low-pH soaps to discourage bacterial colonization.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-14 13:59:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Women with BCRL show medical costs $14,887 to $23,167 higher than women with breast cancer without BCRL. Indirect costs (e.g., work days lost) are also higher for BCRL (<LINK REF="REF-Shih-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shih 2009</LINK>). Early detection and treatment can reduce overall costs by maintaining affected limbs at minimal volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Stout-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stout 2012b</LINK>) and treating other comorbidities before they become chronic (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2012</LINK>). Thus, early and cost-effective interventions are important.</P>
<P>MLD is generally considered within the context of CDT, and its relative contribution to CDT needs to be evaluated. CDT is recognized as the therapy of choice by "the International Society of Lymphology (ISL), the National Lymphedema Network (NLN), the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA), the American Lymphedema Framework Project (ALFP), and the North American Lymphedema Education Association (NALEA)" (<LINK REF="REF-Zuther-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuther 2011a</LINK>). Practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2012</LINK>), reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kligman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kligman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Megans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Megans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockson 1998</LINK>), and a consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-Bernas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernas 2001</LINK>) also recommend CDT as the preferred treatment for BCRL.</P>
<P>However, a practitioner-based survey (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_rki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kärki 2009</LINK>) shows that although MLD is theoretically given as part of CDT, in reality, MLD is often given without compression therapy. Thus, MLD needs to be evaluated both within the context of CDT and as a stand-alone modality.</P>
<P>Systematic reviews examining MLD for BCRL present contradictory findings from no benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2013</LINK>), to small benefit (<LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2011</LINK>), to substantial benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2007</LINK>) to inconclusive benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Devoogdt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devoogdt 2010</LINK>). This review is the first to use primarily individual patient data to calculate missing or unreported primary outcomes, and thus explore the current contradictory findings of present reviews.</P>
<P>It is also important to assess whether there are certain groups of participants who may be responders to MLD. <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>, for example, observed that participants with mild (<U>&lt;</U> 15% excess volume at baseline) or early (&lt; 12 months' BCRL duration) appeared to benefit from MLD more than those with moderate/severe BCRL, or those with durations 12 months or more. This requires further exploration. This review is the first to utilize available individual patient data to further explore possible subgroups of responders.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-14 16:02:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Two review authors (EM, JE) per trial independently assessed risk of bias, rating each risk-of-bias item as "low risk of bias", "unclear", or "high risk of bias" based on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> recommendations (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.welch.jhmi.edu/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007258.pub2/full#CD007258-bbs2-0024">Higgins 2011</A>). When information was missing from the publication, we contacted the authors when possible. Disagreements were resolved by discussion (EM, JE). Our reasoning for each rating is described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>In addition to the pre-specified 'Risk of bias' items, we added 'Treatment Adherence' as a further potential source of bias. We consider adherence with therapy to be a vital component because in the first phase of treatment, adherence means receiving the prescribed therapy sessions as planned and following the home regimen. The second phase of complete decongestive therapy (CDT/CDP) (the maintenance phase), depends almost exclusively on participants' adherence with the home regimen (compression therapy, exercises, skin care, self-massage) as there is theoretically little to no treatment from practitioners. Thus, adherence has two dimensions: (1) whether participants attended their required number of sessions, and (2) whether participants performed their home self-care regimens.</P>
<P>For the first phase of treatment, a trial was rated as "low risk of bias" if the results stated the mean or median number of sessions attended, and if that number was close to the target number of sessions in the methods section. A trial was rated as "unclear" if there was no mention of the number of total sessions participants attended, and "high risk of bias" if the number of sessions attended was notably lower than the target number described in the methods section.</P>
<P>For the second phase of treatment, a trial was rated as "low risk of bias" if it mentioned that there was a method such as a diary to check self-care adherence AND that method showed that there was high adherence. A trial was rated as "unclear" if there was a method stated to measure adherence but no mention of the results of that method. A trial was rated as "high risk of bias" if there was a method stated to measure adherence and the results showed that there was high non-adherence with self-care.</P>
<P>We also assessed the adequacy of the MLD treatments because inadequate treatments could bias results towards a type II error (false negative). There are different types of MLD, but similar principles are followed in each. Two MLD therapists per trial (MM, CT, KJ, DK) were given the excerpts of the MLD descriptions, inclusion criteria and other relevant methods, but were blinded to the study authors/citation. They were asked to rate the MLD treatment as 'adequate', 'not adequate', or 'not enough information to decide'. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>

The <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table shows the most important characteristics of these included trials. All trials were in English although country of trial varied: Canada (<LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>), Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>), Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK> ), and United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions used in the trials</HEADING>
<P>All trials combined MLD with some form of compression therapy. MLD was not given as a stand-alone treatment in any of the trials, and complex decongestive therapy (CDT) was not given as the baseline intervention in any of the trials.</P>
<P>Trials fell into three categories.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>One trial assessed standard physiotherapy (compression therapy, lymph-reducing exercises (LREs), skin care), with or without MLD (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>). Compression therapy was a two-stage process: For the first couple of weeks, participants used decreasing sizes of Jobst compression garments to reduce the edema, then they were fitted for a custom-made sleeve-and-glove garment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging</HEADING>
<P>Two trials assessed the effectiveness of MLD as an adjunct to compression bandaging (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>). Thus, baseline compression bandaging was given to both groups, and MLD was given to one group and not the other.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(3) MLD + compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment + compression therapy</HEADING>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) assessed MLD compared with another active treatment. Thus, baseline compression therapy was given to both groups. MLD was given to one group and a different nonMLD treatment added to the control group. The nonMLD treatment for the control group was intermittent sequential pneumatic pump in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>) and simple lymphatic drainage in the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>). Simple lymphatic drainage can be administered by a therapist or by the patient, herself, because it is designed to facilitate lymphatic movement in the areas of the body by focusing on areas that the patient can reach. Therefore, the back is not treated in simple lymphatic drainage, but the chest and axilla are. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>), the patient performed the simple lymphatic drainage, and in the other simple lymphatic drainage trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>)<B>, </B>the therapist performed simple lymphatic drainage.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Timing of addition of MLD</HEADING>
<P>In four trials, compression therapy was given concurrently with MLD (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) while in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>), compression therapy was administered two weeks prior to MLD, and then in the third week, MLD was added to compression therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Types of baseline interventions</HEADING>
<P>CDT was not given in any trial. Five trials gave compression therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>); one trial gave standard therapy: compression sleeve, lymphedema exercises and skin care to both groups, with or without MLD (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>). No trial assessed MLD as a stand-alone intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Types of baseline compression therapy</HEADING>
<P>Type of baseline compression therapy given to both treatment and control groups varied among trials. Three trials used compression bandaging (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>); three trials used compression sleeves (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes reported</HEADING>
<P>All trials assessed arm volume reduction as the primary outcome (either as a per cent reduction, lymphedema volume, or volume reduction). Only one trial also assessed truncal lymphedema (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial designs</HEADING>
<P>All trials were parallel-group designs with the exception of one cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) for which we used only first-cycle data. <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK> permitted those in the control group to optionally cross-over at three months, so that if they desired, they could get MLD during the maintenance phase.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Follow-up and sample size</HEADING>
<P>Follow-up times were presented immediately post-treatment for all trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>), and that trial followed up for one year. All trials assessed Phase 1 (decongestion phase), and only one (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>) also assessed Phase 2 (maintenance phase).</P>
<P>Trials were small with a median of 35 total participants per trial (range 24 to 45) and a total of 208 participants. We were able to obtain individual patient data from four trials for subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants</HEADING>
<P>MLD and CDT are highly physical, intensive interventions. It is impossible to blind participants to the treatment group assignment. Patient blinding would have only been possible had there been a sham MLD treatment compared with a real treatment, and no trial used that design. Therefore, none of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) reported patient blinding. However, inability to blind participants and the potential for performance bias, is most important in trials in which the primary outcome is a subjective self-report (<LINK REF="REF-Manheimer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manheimer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). The primary outcome in these trials was volume change, which is an objective outcome measured by an outcomes assessor and is not a subjective self-report. Measures of function, such as range of motion and strength are also objective measures assessed by an outcomes assessor. Thus, for these outcomes, we do not consider performance bias to be a major concern.</P>
<P>However, the lack of patient blinding could present a concern in subjective self-reported outcomes (i.e., sensations of pain, heaviness, tension), quality of life, or other self-reported psychosocial outcomes such as body image. Trials where there is a therapist-administered intervention in one group, but not in the other may be especially prone to biasing subjective outcomes because the therapist's touch, time, and attention can provide powerful nonspecific effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcomes assessor</HEADING>
<P>Both limb volume and functional outcomes of range of motion and strength are objective outcomes assessed by a person other than the patient.

Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) did not blind the outcomes assessor and were therefore judged as having a high-risk of bias; one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>) clearly blinded the outcomes assessor, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>) was unclear from the publication, and the author could not be contacted.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 16:06:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>We have reviewed the results of six clinical trials assessing the relative contribution of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) in treating breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).  Several outcomes have been examined including the objective outcomes of lymphedema (LE) volumetric changes and range of motion as well as the subjective outcomes of pain, tension, heaviness, and quality of life. All trials added some type of compression therapy to MLD; no trial assessed MLD as a stand-alone therapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Volumetric changes in lymphedema of the arm, hand, breast or trunk</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>) examined per cent reduction by using standard physiotherapy with/without MLD and found no between-groups differences, and an overall reduction of 43% from baseline in the two groups combined. Two trials examined per cent reduction in lymphedema by using MLD and compression bandaging (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>). The addition of MLD to bandaging provided a 7.11 % additional per cent reduction compared to the control group. The additional volume reduction is surprisingly similar between the two trials given their different designs: <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK> gave MLD in the first week and prior to each session of compression bandaging, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK> gave two weeks of compression bandaging alone to both groups before giving MLD plus compression bandaging to the treatment group in the third week. One might assume that because volume reductions are the greatest in the first week (<LINK REF="REF-Leduc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leduc 1998</LINK>), the trial giving MLD in the third week would show a smaller contribution of MLD. Indeed, the trial giving MLD in the third week (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>) showed smaller absolute reductions than the trial providing MLD throughout the intervention period of four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>), but the relative reductions were the same.</P>
<P>There are three possible explanations for the similarity of relative reductions: Chance, bias, or a true finding. If the results are due to chance, then future attempts to replicate these results would most likely show a different finding. If the results are due to bias, it may be that as <LINK REF="REF-Oremus-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oremus 2012</LINK> has suggested, lower-quality designs in LE tend to produce larger effects. Thus, the quasi-randomized design administering MLD in the third week, (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>) may have overestimated effects. If the results are due to a true finding, then the 7.11% reduction in both trials may represent a portion of lymphatic fluid, albeit small, that is more conducive to being mobilized by MLD than by compression bandaging. It may also be that the limb may be more conducive to improved lymphatic drainage once the initial limb reduction has been achieved with compression therapy. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0 showing no statistical heterogeneity between the two trials lends credence to the idea that although the trials used different designs; they are, in fact, very similar. By either design, compression bandaging achieved greater volume reductions than MLD, and support a commonly held notion that MLD should be considered within the context of compression therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lasinski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasinski 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leduc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leduc 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other two volumetric outcomes showed mixed results: there was no significant change in LE volume between treatment groups whereas volume reduction approached significance, favoring MLD. The lack of a significant difference of LE volume may be because the participants who had the greatest relative reductions (per cent reductions) had lower excess volumes to begin with (i.e., mild BCRL) and the group means could have been influenced by a few severe cases that obscured any detection of a mean benefit. It may also be that the absolute amounts of fluid reduction from MLD are small amounts and not reflected in LE volume, which is an estimate of absolute rather than relative reduction.</P>
<P>Three trials examined MLD plus compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment and compression therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) and the three trials were too different from one another to be pooled and results varied according to the volumetric outcome used. The inconsistent results within the same trial depending on the volumetric outcome used has also been reported in a recent randomized trial (<LINK REF="REF-Dayes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayes 2013</LINK>) suggesting more research needs to be done to determine the most clinically meaningful volumetric measurement. The work of <LINK REF="REF-Ancukiewicz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ancukiewicz 2012</LINK> suggests relative rather than absolute values are more reliable. Other technologies such as bioimpedance and tissue dielectric constant also need to be explored as potentially clinically meaningful outcomes.</P>
<P>The trials using standard sleeves as the baseline compression therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) showed smaller per cent reductions than those using compression bandaging or a custom-made sleeve-and-glove garment applied after successive standard sleeves first reduced volume.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup Analyses</B>
</P>
<P>A question raised by this review is whether there is a subgroup of participants for whom MLD might be more beneficial. Notably, there are limitations to subgroup analyses, for numbers are small, and multiple testing can result in Type I (false positive) errors. Thus, the subgroup analyses finding that mild-to-moderate BCRL (less than a 23% baseline excess volume) was associated with a significant response to MLD should not be taken as confirmatory evidence, but rather should be tested in a randomized controlled trial. Such a trial might include only participants with up to 23% excess volume and be designed to elucidate the effectiveness of the MLD component of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). The subgroup findings are consistent with prior studies showing that mild BCRL responds better to CDT in general than do moderate or severe cases (<LINK REF="STD-Didem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Didem 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wozniewski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wozniewski 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK> has previously noted that mild participants appeared to show a greater relative response to MLD, and suggested a mechanism of action. In mild BCRL, the lymphatic system would be relatively intact and thus, more readily improved. Thus, MLD would be more capable of both stimulating lymphatic flow and rerouting lymphatic flow via collaterals. By contrast, the more severely edematous limbs, apparently unresponsive to MLD, may have more secondary damage to their lymphatic system and thus, only respond to compression bandaging through its influence on microvascular pressure. The tissue changes in more severe edema are characterized by more fat tissue and fibrosis, likely resulting in a poorer response to treatment with MLD.</P>
<P>Our finding of an apparent subgroup of responders raises important questions about how to interpret the varied results of the six trials in this review. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>, using baseline compression bandaging, found no additional benefit of MLD. While this may be due to true equivalence of the two therapies, it may also be due to an inclusion criteria that excluded mild BCRL. A similar question could be asked for <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>, who found no between-groups difference for per cent reduction in a design of standard care with/without MLD and included BCRL severity up to 30% excess baseline volume.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses of the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>) which gave an active therapy to the control group used compression sleeves instead of compression bandaging showed no association between mild BCRL and response to MLD. The lack of a significant finding in the sleeve trials may indicate equivalence of active treatments, low power, or the possibility that standard sleeves might not sufficiently decongest lymphedemic areas or retain the volume reductions achieved by manual therapies in Phase 1.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The functional outcome of range of motion showed contradictory results because of the two trials measuring range of motion; one reported improvements in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>), and the other reported improvements in neither group (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>). The functional outcome of strength was measured in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>), there were no improvements for either group.</P>
<P>Subjective sensations of pain, heaviness, and tightness were highly influenced by treatment in the four trials in which those outcomes were measured with all groups showing significant improvement from baseline but no between-groups differences. More research needs to be done to tease apart whether one intervention is better than another at improving subjective symptoms of discomfort and how long these improvements can be maintained.</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) outcomes were inconclusive because, of the two trials that measured them, one did not report results, and the other reported within-groups results only. Yet, QoL is affected in BCRL (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chachaj-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chachaj 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maunsell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maunsell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pusic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pusic 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ridner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sagen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagen 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, at the time the trials were done, lymphedema-specific QoL scales such as the ULL-27 (<LINK REF="REF-Augustin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Augustin 2005</LINK>); FLQA-L (<LINK REF="REF-Launois-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Launois 2000</LINK>); Lymph-IFC (<LINK REF="REF-Devoogdt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devoogdt 2011</LINK>) and LYMQOL (<LINK REF="REF-Keeley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 2010</LINK>) were either nonexistent or in their infancy. Future research should utilize lymphedema-specific quality-of-life measures because QoL in BCRL is complicated and often related to lymphedema-specific symptoms that are not well captured in more general QoL scales. Moreover, volume reductions alone may not be sufficient to improve women&#8217;s impaired psychosocial ratings (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1993</LINK>), because QoL scores are often related to other comorbidities such as pain and dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Hormes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hormes 2010</LINK>). The possibility that exercise may be able to address other comorbidities and, thus, improve quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2012</LINK>) provides a reason to investigate combination therapy of exercise with CDT.</P>
<P>Adverse events were minimal, and MLD was well tolerated. When trials reported adverse events, they were limited to one or two participants, usually from bandaging irritation and none due to MLD. Further contact with authors confirmed that adherence with receiving MLD was high (only one to three dropouts in a trial). Thus, with high adherence to MLD and no participant experiencing an adverse event from MLD, MLD appears safe and well tolerated in this population.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:15:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>All trials presented data on the main outcome of volumetric change. There were three volumetric change measures (per cent reduction, LE volume - excess mL left in the arm at the end of the trial, and volume reduction - the estimated mL reduced from pre- to post-treatment). Some trials reported on all three, and some only one; however, we were able to calculate the others for the four trials from which we received the raw data, so we believe the data displaying volumetric changes are highly complete. Thus, the volumetric evidence is sufficiently complete that a physician, therapist, or patient could see the relative contribution of MLD.</P>
<P>Completeness of the other important outcomes was lacking. Functional measures (range of motion, strength), quality of life, and subjective sensations were assessed in less than half the trials and difficult to interpret. <LINK REF="REF-Kligman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kligman 2004</LINK> suggests including these measures because they help translate research into practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:15:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The evidence from this review supports the common practice of combining MLD with compression bandaging for the treatment of BCRL and shows MLD is well tolerated. However, the data from this review were not sufficient to address the objectives of assessing quality of life or functional improvement. Furthermore, in some practice settings, MLD is given without compression therapy, and no trial in this review assessed MLD alone. </P>
<P>Methodological quality of the evidence varied among the trials with some trials being scored as "low risk of bias" on nearly all measures, and other trials being scores "unclear" or "high risk of bias" on some items. There was an insufficient number of trials within any subgroup to assess whether the effects of MLD varied with any of the 'Risk of bias' domains in the trials. However, we note that the greatest number of weak methodological scores appear for blinding where four of the six trials did not use a blinded outcomes assessor when measuring volumetric outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-10 03:01:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>It is unlikely that an important bias was introduced in the search for trials. We have comprehensively searched across databases, searched the gray literature, corresponded with trialists, and used no language exclusions. We have used state-of-the-art methods in evaluating trials and conducting data analysis. If there is any bias that has influenced the review, it may be that we have included one quasi-randomized trial, which may have biased towards positive results. However, <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2011</LINK>, a systematic review using only randomized trials reached similar conclusions to ours.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-07 20:16:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We have observed that outcomes capturing the multiple comorbidities of BCRL and the psychosocial/quality-of-life aspects of BCRL were measured in less than half the trials, and these observations are consistent with <LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_rki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kärki 2009</LINK> who observed a lack of patient-centered outcomes in BCRL trials.</P>
<P>We have noted that in trials combining compression bandaging with MLD, the compression bandaging yields greater volume reduction than does MLD. In the control groups which received only compression bandaging, limb reductions were 30% (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1999</LINK>) and 38.6% (<LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>). These reductions from compression bandaging alone are comparable to the 36% in a control group of compression bandaging with nonlocal remedial exercise for BCRL (<LINK REF="STD-Didem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Didem 2005</LINK>) and estimates from a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have also noted that MLD gives mixed results: when added to compression bandaging, it yields a small relative benefit, but when compared to another active treatment with baseline compression sleeves to both groups, results sometimes show a significant difference favoring MLD, and other times, show no significant difference between MLD and another active treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Dayes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayes 2013</LINK>, in a randomized trial of CDT versus compression alone, noted similar inconsistency in volumetric outcomes suggesting more research needs to be done to identify the most clinically meaningful volume measure.</P>
<P>Most importantly, our findings reconcile the apparent conflicting findings of other reviews on the role of MLD in treating BCRL. Two reviews, <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2011</LINK> using only randomized data, and <LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2007</LINK> using both randomized and uncontrolled data estimated there is a benefit of MLD. Their selected outcome was a composite of volumetric outcomes including percentage reduction. Our data on percentage reduction, had we pooled trials across assorted control groups, would concur with these reviews. We did not present a global pooled point estimate in our review due to differences across treatment and control groups. By contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2013</LINK> reports no effect of MLD. Their selected outcome was LE volume. Our data on LE volume, had we pooled trials across assorted control groups, would concur with <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2013</LINK> with no significant result for MLD.</P>
<P>Thus, the apparent contradictory findings of different reviews of MLD are explainable by the outcome selected. What explains the different findings based on different outcomes? It is perhaps that the participants who had the greatest per cent reductions had lower excess volumes to begin with. These would be those with mild BCRL or mildly moderate BCRL, the group identified in our subgroup analysis as perhaps being more likely to respond to MLD. Those with larger baseline volumes may have shown larger absolute reductions, but these may have been small in percentage points.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is safe and well tolerated.</LI>
<LI>MLD may offer additional benefit when added to intensive compression bandaging for reducing swelling.</LI>
<LI>Subgroup analysis suggests that Individuals with mild-to-moderate breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by further research.</LI>
<LI>In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared to a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial, and therefore, not generalizable. Trials using standard sleeves did not appear to be as effective as trials using compression bandaging or fitted garment for reducing swelling.</LI>
<LI>The impact on QoL is not known as no between-groups results have been presented.</LI>
<LI>The results of function measured as range of motion were mixed in two trials.</LI>
<LI>For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, many participants reported feeling better from baseline regardless of which treatment they received. There were no between-groups differences.</LI>
<LI>One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling was reduced, participants were able to keep their swelling down by continuing to use a custom-made sleeve. It is also important to do regular check-ups for volume status to make sure that the treatments are continuing to maintain limb volume over time (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2010</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>All the trials included in this review used some compression intervention in addition to MLD, and no trial examined MLD alone although there is evidence from practitioner surveys that MLD is often given alone (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_rki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kärki 2009</LINK>). Thus, an important question is unanswered, namely, whether MLD alone would be of benefit especially in participants with mild BCRL?</LI>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-14 16:06:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>(1) The relative contribution of MLD to complex decongestive therapy (CDT) should be examined. We were not able to answer the question of the relative contribution of MLD to CDT because no trial included all the CDT components. A limitation of trials designed to assess MLD in the absence of all four CDT components is that potential synergisms between components may be missed.. For example, few trials in this review incorporated lymph-reducing exercises. Yet, <LINK REF="STD-Didem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Didem 2005</LINK>, showed 55.7% per cent reductions in the intervention group which received all four CDT components, and only a 36% per cent reduction in the control group which had no MLD and replaced the lymph-reducing exercises with nonlocal exercises. The control group results raise the question as to whether the notable lower per cent reductions were in part due to losing the synergistic effect of both the MLD and lymph-reducing exercises. The question of synergism between components can be addressed in a 2 x 2 factorial design that gives compression bandaging to all groups. The MLD and lymph-reducing exercises could be altered so that one group gets neither, one group gets both, and two groups get only one of the two. Thus, individual as well as combined effects could be explored.</P>
<P>(2) The clinical relevance of the various volumetric outcomes should be established. We have noted inconsistent findings across three volumetric outcomes. Within the same trial, one volumetric outcome might show statistical significance and another would not. More research needs to be done to establish which is the most clinically relevant volumetric outcome. There is also a need for the development and testing of measurement instruments that are more sensitive to early increase of fluid in the subcutaneous tissue such as Bioimpedance and Tissue Dielectric Constant that are easy to use in practice.</P>
<P>(3) Trials should include volumetric outcomes beyond arm volume. Only one trial in this review included truncal BCRL, and none addressed breast lymphedema (LE). However, both <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lasinski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasinski 2013</LINK> suggest MLD may play an important role in areas such as chest wall or breast swelling that are not conducive to compression therapy, and this needs further investigation.</P>
<P>(4) Trials should include quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes. Future research needs to focus on quality of life using lymphedema-specific quality-of-life scales. Other psychosocial outcomes, such as decreased body image, depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and sexual dysfunction were not reported in any trials. These need to be included in research because patient-centered outcomes, more than volume alone, are likely to influence clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kligman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kligman 2004</LINK>). Where these instruments are lacking, they need to be further developed and tested specifically for lymphedema.</P>
<P>(5) Trials need longer follow-up times. All trials in this review ended immediately at the end of treatment with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>. However, important clinical outcomes such as fibrotic formation and cellulitis episodes require long-term follow-up. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Dayes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayes 2013</LINK> recently noted that participants with a lymphedema diagnosis greater than one year showed more benefit from CDT than from compression garments alone. They proposed that "longstanding lymphedema with tissue fibrosis may not be amenable to compression alone but may respond to gentle massage breaking down scarring" (<LINK REF="REF-Dayes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayes 2013</LINK> 2013). Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Leduc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leduc 1998</LINK> proposed that MLD reduces fibrotic formation by moving protein out of the interstitial space. Other important questions can be answered with long-term follow-up: Does MLD affect the condition of the skin and tissues, in terms of fibrosis, scarring, and post-radiation changes? What about long-term effects on the lymphatics? Does MLD assist in re-establishing lymphatic drainage in areas damaged by cancer treatments? Does it assist in building collateral vessels and so over time help control swelling?</P>
<P>(6) Trials should investigate functional outcomes and combine therapies that might optimize functional improvements. Of the few trials in this review that assessed function, results were contradictory. Future trials should investigate functional outcomes and combine therapies that potentially complement one another by combining those for reducing swelling with those for improving function (i.e., MLD/CDT plus aerobic and/or resistance training). Recent exercise trials of cardiovascular/strength training to improve function have shown promising results (<LINK REF="REF-Courneya-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courneya 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Courneya-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courneya 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NLN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLN 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The enthusiasm for exercise for BCRL can be attributed to three recent findings: First, exercise is safe and contrary to past beliefs, does not increase the incidence or flare ups of BCRL (<LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2010</LINK>), and may actually protect against flare ups (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2009</LINK>). Secondly, a variety of exercise types has been shown to be safe for women with BCRL including water exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2013</LINK>), resistance training when gradually increased (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2012</LINK>), aerobic exercise plus resistance training (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 2003</LINK>), and pole walking (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00f6_nsson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jönsson 2009</LINK>), Thirdly, pain/tenderness may be reduced by exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, functional improvements should be defined in practical terms, not just as improved strength or range or motion, but also as how well an intervention improves activities of daily living such as the ability to perform household chores, carry heavy objects, open a jar, and push a door (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2012</LINK>). Factorial designs can permit the assessment of individual therapies alone and in combination.</P>
<P>(7) Identifying potential subgroups of responders may help to individualize BCRL treatment in the future. Our subgroup analysis showed that participants with less than 23% excess volume at baseline (mild-to-moderate participants) may be the best responders to MLD. A randomized trial should examine this further.</P>
<P>Although duration of BCRL appears to be associated with response to MLD at various time points, subgroup analyses from other randomized trials show conflicting results of duration; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK> found less than one year duration associated with treatment response, and <LINK REF="REF-Dayes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayes 2013</LINK> found more than one year duration was associated with treatment response. Clearly more work needs to be done to understand the effect of duration of lymphedema on treatment response and how it may be confounded by severity.</P>
<P>If treatment of BCRL is to be individualized to optimize benefit and cost efficiency, it would be important to identify other subgroups, and more than one possible subgroup can be examined in the same trial. For example, are radiation-induced stenotic/fibrotic changes less responsive to MLD than lymphatic damage from surgical scarring? Stratifying on radiation damage could examine this question.</P>
<P>(8) MLD alone should be examined. All the trials included in the review used some compression intervention in addition to MLD, and no trial examined MLD alone. A trial design of MLD alone should be designed especially in participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL. A three-arm trial of MLD and compression therapy alone and in combination would efficiently answer the question of the relative contributions of each.</P>
<P>(9) Trials should focus on primary prevention. Because BCRL comes from surgery and/or radiation treatments for breast cancer, true primary prevention should focus on identifying the surgical and radiographic techniques that yield the lowest incidence of BCRL without compromising efficacy. Weight management should also be investigated as a primary prevention method.</P>
<P>(10) More high-quality studies are warranted. The ''Risk of bias' tool in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) can serve as a guideline for rigorous trial design.</P>

<P>In our protocol, we proposed to examine the trials pertaining to CDT and to MLD. However, since that protocol was written, another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Preston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 2004</LINK>) has examined CDT. Therefore, our focus is on MLD. </P>
<P>Also, when we wrote the protocol, some assessment methods such as tissue dielectric constant and bioimpedance were nonexistent or in their infancy. We have opted to include them as acceptable means of assessing LE in order to reflect the state of the art practice; however, it should be noted that even though we permitted these assessments, none of the included trials used them.</P>
<P>Finally, there are outcomes which appear in this review that do not appear in the protocol. Again, this is because since the time of the protocol submission, outcomes in this area have continued to evolve. We have elected to include these additional outcomes for the sake of comprehensiveness not only for this review, but so that anyone doing research in this field, could see in a thumbnail sketch using this review ALL the outcomes that had been used in prior trials. The category under secondary outcomes entitled "other" captures these outcomes that have not been prespecified in the protocol.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Adequate: Results (1<SUP>st</SUP> paragraph): &#8220;Forty-four patients were randomized, but 2 patients, one in each treatment group, were subsequently found not to be eligible (one was found to have lymphedema caused by a local recurrence and one was randomized less than 4 months after surgery).&#8221; However, these 2 ineligible patients are unlikely to contribute to incomplete outcome data. Section 8.12.1 of The Cochrane Handbook has the following guidance about this: &#8220;</P>
<P>Some exclusions of participants may be justifiable, in which case they need not be considered as leading to missing outcome data (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2002</LINK>). For example, participants who are randomized but are subsequently found not to have been eligible for the trial may be excluded, as long as the discovery of ineligibility could not have been affected by the randomized intervention, and preferably on the basis of decisions made blinded to assignment.</P>
<P>&#8221; Besides these 2 ineligible patients, there was one other dropout before the 3 month cross-over point (&#8216;Results&#8217; 1<SUP>st</SUP> paragraph): &#8220;This allowed data to be obtained on 42 patients at 1 month, on 41 patients at 3 months&#8230;&#8221; In the section &#8216;Statistical methods&#8217;: &#8220;The effect of treatment was analyzed by intention to treat.&#8221;</P>
<P>Because the publication does not state how imputations were done for any missing data, it is not clear if this was truly intention-to-treat. However, whether or not a true intention-to-treat analysis was used is largely not relevant because there was only 1 dropout (other than the 2 exclusions) prior to the cross-over at 3 months.</P>

[These two patients were assumedly not randomized, because the randomization occurred at the end of Part I.] The mean +/- SD (range) age of the remaining 38 women was 64 +/-12 (37-83) years in the CB group (n=18) and 58 +/-12 (41-80) years in the CB + MLD group (n=20).&#8221; The tables in the Results section indicated that there were 18 participants in CB group and 20 in CB + MLD group. Thus, there is a small discrepancy in the numbers of participants included in Part II: it is not clear from the text copied above whether there were 18 and 20 analyzed in the two groups or whether there were 18 and 17 (for CB and CB+MLD respectively). It was also not clear how many patients were randomized and the reasons for the dropouts. However, even under the worst case scenario, if all 38 patients who completed Part I (i.e., the 40 patients who started minus the 2 patients who dropped out during Part I) were randomized and 35 were included in the analysis (i.e., 18 + 17), these 3 dropouts out of 38 randomized would still be a low risk of bias.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Adequate: &#8216;Abstract&#8217;: &#8220;The sole outcome measure was percentage change in excess limb volume (PCEV) following treatment.&#8221; &#8216;Patients and methods: Outcome measures&#8217;: &#8220;A recent review of the accuracy of assessment methods for lymphoedematous limbs concluded that this &#8216;tape measure&#8217; method of measurement is accurate and reliable when used by a single operator using a good technique (Stanton et al. 2000).&#8221; </P>
<P>Thus, because the limb volume was the sole outcome, and also because the &#8216;tape measure&#8217; method is an accurate way to assess limb volume (and would likely give the same results as the water displacement method), there is a low risk of selective outcome reporting.</P>

<P>Lymphedema Volume</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The <B>excess volume</B> in the limb. The volume is measured in milliliters (mL). It is called &#8216;lymphedema volume&#8217; because it is the amount of the limb volume that is attributed to lymphedema. Lymphedema volume is NOT the total volume of the limb. To calculate the lymphedema volume, you have to compare the affected limb to the unaffected limb by subtracting. In this review, we are interested in the lymphedema volume (or excess volume) that remains in the limb after treatment.</P>

<P>Per cent Reduction</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The decrease in excess volume relative to the amount of excess volume at baseline. Both the <B>lymphedema volume</B> and the <B>volume reduction</B> are considered absolute values not relative values. However, when absolute values are used, a person with a large excess limb volume might get a 2% reduction, but the amount can look large because the beginning volume was large. By contrast, a person with a small beginning volume, can get a 30% reduction, and it can look small in absolute terms. Thus, it is valuable to have a third way to think about lymphedema outcomes, and that is to look at the per cent change because that is a relative value.</P>
