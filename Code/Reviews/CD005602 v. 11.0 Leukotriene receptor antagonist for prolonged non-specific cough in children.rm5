Selection of appropriate outcome measures ? it is quite unlikely that cough frequency when measured using a microphone or other method is Normally distributed, even if the results are transposed. When/if this review is to be repeated when there are data for the management of non-specific cough using LTRA drugs, then this observation should be considered. [No action needed at present, CJC]&lt;br&gt;2. Methodology ? I would not have considered the van Adelberg study as the subjects appear to have heterogenous respiratory onditions - I would simply have said in the review 'There are no studies of the value of LTRA drugs for the treatment of non-specific cough in children' and that be the end of it. [I think the key issue here is whether the reviewers would be quite happy to combine the results of Adelberg with future studies that have cleaner entry crfiteria - if so it can stay, if not this study should be relegated to discussion section as suggested. What does Anne think?]&lt;br&gt;3. 5.Recommendations for further research ?&lt;br&gt;Before drug trials are undertaken, much more needs to be understood about the reason(s) for persisitent non-specific cough in children. There is some evidence in animals and in children that RSV and adenoviris respectively persists in the major airways but for children the evidence is conflicting.

<P>Children with non-specific cough (dry and non-productive cough without any other respiratory symptom, sign or systemic illness) are commonly treated with a variety of medications to treat the symptom of cough. This review examined whether there was any evidence for using leukotriene receptor antagonist in children with non-specific cough. There were two randomised controlled trials that included, but was not restricted to, children with non-specific cough, whereby no significant advantage over placebo was found in both studies. There is no RCT evidence to support the routine use of leukotriene receptor antagonist for the symptom of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of this treatment using child appropriate cough outcome measures is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including a variety of asthma medications. The leukotriene pathway is reported to be involved in the sensory (neurogenic) pathway, which is a mechanism thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic cough. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-29 12:53:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to general practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>) and causes significant anxiety to parents (<LINK REF="REF-Cornford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornford 1993</LINK>). Worldwide the desire to reduce the impact of the symptom of cough is reflected in the billions of dollars spent on over the counter cough and cold medications. Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>). While some children with chronic non-specific cough have asthma, the majority do not (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). In adults, chronic cough is defined as cough of over 8 weeks duration but the definition commonly accepted in children is that of over 3-4 weeks, based on the known differences between paediatric and adults cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2005b</LINK>). </P>
<P>The leukotriene pathway is reported to be involved in the sensory (neurogenic) pathway (<LINK REF="REF-Ishikawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishikawa 1996</LINK>) which is a key mechanism thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic cough (<LINK REF="REF-Mazzone-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzone 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widdicombe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdicombe 1995</LINK>). Although leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are now primarily used for asthma, they have also been shown to reduce respiratory symptoms associated with post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2003</LINK>). The influence of LTRA in post RSV bronchiolitis is likely through the effect of LTRA on the neurogenic pathway, as demonstrated in animal work (<LINK REF="REF-Wedde_x002d_Beer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedde-Beer 2002</LINK>). While post RSV bronchiolitis symptoms do not constitute non-specific cough, a similar mechanism involving the neurogenic pathway maybe involved in the pathophysiology of chronic non-specific cough. Thus it is biologically plausible that LTRA may be beneficial in non-specific cough (separate to its anti-asthma properties) through its action on the neurogenic pathway. However like all medications, use of LTRAs may cause adverse events. A systematic review of the benefits (or otherwise) of LTRA on chronic non-specific cough would thus be useful to help guide clinical practice.</P>

<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the following information was recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible subjects), inclusion and exclusion criteria, other symptoms, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of intervention, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data was extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information was requested from the authors of the single included study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>)</P>

<P>Rias of bias table in Revman was utilised. Aditionally quality assessment of the study included was independently performed by two reviewers (AC, JA). Four components of quality were assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Adequate concealment, Grade B: Unclear, Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Blinding. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Participant and care provider and outcome assessor blinded, Grade B: Outcome assessor blinded, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: No blinding of outcome assessor (Grade A, B = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Reporting of participants by allocated group. Trials were scored as: Grade A: The progress of all randomised children in each group described, Grade B: Unclear or no mention of withdrawals or dropouts, Grade C: The progress of all randomised children in each group clearly not described. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Follow-up. Trials were scored as: Grade A: Outcomes measured in &gt;90% (where withdrawals due to complications and side-effects are categorised as treatment failures), Grade B: Outcomes measured in 80-90%, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: Outcomes measured in &lt;80%. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-08-01 13:39:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>It was planned that the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions will be calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis would have assumed that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies of all the individually analysed studies to examine whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) would have been reasonable was planned. This would have taken into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>

<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest would have been included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed-effect model) would have been calculated (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan 4.2). For cross-over studies, mean treatment differences would have been calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed effects generic inverse variance (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% confidence intervals. In cross-over trials, only data from the first arm would have been included in meta analysis if data is combined with parallel studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Numbers needed to treat (NNT) would have been calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). The cough indices would have been assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes could be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference would have been estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results would have been described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random-effects model would have been included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>The Airways Group Specialised Register/search identified 226 potentially relevant titles in the original search (2005). After assessing the abstracts, 24 papers were retrieved and five potential studies were considered (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). For the 2006 and 2007 updates, a further 62 and 40 abstracts were reviewed but no study fulfilled inclusion criteria. The 2008 search identified 63 abstracts of which 5 were obtained but none fulfilled inclusion criteria. The 2009 search identified 62 potential studies from which 9 papers were fully reviewed and only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>) had subjects that fulfilled inclusion criteria. Of the 54 potential titles in the 2010 search, 4 papers were described in the 'excluded studies' list.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Although the term 'asthma symptoms' which included cough was an inclusion criteria in the first included study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>), it is likely that a number of children would not have fulfilled study criteria of non-specific cough. Data were sought from the corresponding author of the trial but none was received. The study was designed primarily for safety and tolerability of montelukast but analysis included clinical efficacy (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The study was supported and reported by a commercial interest. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>) included children with cough alone and hence fulfilled inclusion criteria. Raw data provided by the primary author revealed 11 children were in the 'cough only' subgroup of which only 6 (5 in montelukast group and one in placebo group) could be included for this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-11-14 03:14:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>One study included 256 randomised subjects (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>). There was no difference in all study endpoints between the montelukast and placebo groups. As it was not possible to separate children with non-specific cough from those without, no data have been presented in the MetaView. Cough was not reported as an outcome measure, thus cough-specific related outcomes cannot be described. Clinical adverse events were also not different between groups and no serious adverse events occurred in either group. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>) included in this review had a subgroup that fulfilled the criteria (cough only). Relevant data obtained from the raw results provided by the primary data are displayed in the analysis were but the effect of the intervention could not be estimated as the sample size was too small (n=6).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-14 03:15:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Two randomised controlled trial comparing LTRA with a placebo in children with non-specific cough were identified. These studies were included as the inclusion criteria included children with isolated cough (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>). The authors included symptoms described as 'asthma symptoms' but it is highly controversial if the diagnosis of asthma can be made in the age group (6-24 months) studied (<LINK REF="REF-Strunk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strunk 2002</LINK>). However it is likely that only some of the children in the study would have fulfilled the study criteria.</P>
<P>No difference between groups was found in both clinical efficacy or in adverse events in both studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kooi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kooi 2008</LINK>). In comparison to RCTs in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Dicpinigaitis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dicpinigaitis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2004</LINK>) using LTRA for cough outcomes whereby LTRAs were found to be effective, this review is inconclusive despite the significantly larger sample size (n=256) in the included study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Adelsberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Adelsberg 2005</LINK>) when compared to the study in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Dicpinigaitis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dicpinigaitis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2004</LINK>) (n= 8 and 14 respectively).</P>
<P>A single cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Kopriva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kopriva 2004</LINK>) was also found whereby the time to response was within 3 weeks (mainly within 2 weeks). However this has to interpreted in the context of methodological problems in studies with cough as an outcome measure, specifically the large placebo effect, biased subjective reporting, and period effect (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Given the morbidity associated with chronic cough in children, there is a need for the evaluation of the efficacy of LTRA on non-specific cough in children.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-14 03:16:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>With the lack of evidence, the routine use of LRTA in treating children with non-specific cough cannot be recommended. If LTRA were to be trialled in these children, current cohort data suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) usually occurs within two weeks of therapy and definitely within three weeks. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-14 03:16:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of LTRA to determine the effectiveness in treating children with non-specific cough are clearly needed. Trials should be parallel studies and double blinded, given the known problems in studying cough, specifically the large placebo and time period effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Based on cohort data, a short trial of three weeks would suffice. Outcome measures for the clinical studies on cough should be clearly defined using validated subjective data (including quality of life) and supported by objective data if possible.</P>

<P>Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy parallel trial.</P>
<P>ICS or LTRA use was not allowed for a period of 4 weeks preceding the trial. Other exclusion criteria were as follows: use of systemic corticosteroids in the last 2 months; hospitalization for asthma-related symptoms<BR/>in the last 2 weeks; respiratory disorders other than asthma and poorly controlled systemic diseases. Subsequently, eligible children entered a run-in period of 2 weeks in which the caregivers of the child recorded their child&#8217;s respiratory symptoms in a diary. Children with symptoms on less than 4 days of the<BR/>2-week run-in period or children who used anti-inflammatory medication in this period were excluded at the second visit.</P>
<P>Quality Assessment: B, A, A, B; high quality score of 2.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-11-14 03:06:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Children were recruited from three outpatient clinics (secondary care) in The Netherlands. Children aged<BR/>2&#8211;5 years with asthma-like symptoms (wheeze, cough and/or shortness of breath) of sufficient severity to justify the use of prophylactic asthma treatment were eligible for inclusion.63 aged 2&#8211;6 years with asthma-like symptoms were included.</P>
<P>Number of participants in whole study: Fluticasone (n=25), Montelukast (n=18) or placebo (n=20). Mean age (years and SD) in respective groups were 3.8 (71.4) 3.9 (71.1) and 3.8 (71.3) respectively.</P>
<P>Number of 'cough only' participants in study: Fluticasone (n=5), Montelukast (n=5) or placebo (n=1).</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-14 02:10:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Fluticasone (100 ug twice daily via metered dose inhaler and a spacer (Aerochamber)), Montelukast (4mg daily) or placebo (dummy MDI and dummy tablet) for 3 months.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-11-17 14:54:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The primary outcome was the daily symptom score (wheeze, cough, shortness of breath) as recorded by caregivers in a symptom diary card which were filled out twice daily during the run-in period and 1<BR/>month prior to each follow-up visit. Parents rated their child&#8217;s night-time and day-time symptoms (cough, wheeze and shortness of breath) on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) each morning and evening. Thus, the total daily symptom score ranged from 0 to 18.</P>
<P>Secondary endpoints were rescue medication free days, blood eosinophils and lung function (interrupter technique and forced oscillation technique (FOT)). Data on rescue medication use were derived from the dairy card. The percentage of days on which no rescue medication (salbutamol) was used was calculated. Eosinophils were measured in venous blood at baseline and after 3 months. Lung function was measured using two non-invasive techniques: the interrupter technique and the FOT.</P>
<P>Adverse events and concomitant medication use were obtained from the diary card.</P>

<P>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicentre study, comparing 6 weeks of montelukast with placebo in children aged 6-24 months with 'asthma symptoms' including cough. The study was designed primarily for safety and tolerability of montelukast; number allocated to montelukast to placebo was 2:1. Study was carried out, supported and reported by a commercial interest (Merck Research Laboratories).</P>
<P>Randomisation by computer generated schedule, method of blinding and allocation concealment not described. Adherence not mentioned. Dropouts: montelukast=6 (3.4%), placebo= 7 (8.4%).</P>
<P>Quality Assessment: B, A, A, B; high quality score of 2.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>256 children (359 screened) aged 6-24 months were recruited from 65 centres (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America). Participants were reviewed 2 weekly. Method of recruitment not specified. </P>
<P>Montelukast group: 51 (29%) aged 6-12 months, 124 (70.9%) aged 12.1-24 months; 59 boys, 22 girls. Placebo group: 33 (40.7.%) aged 6-12 months, 48 (59.3%) aged 12.1-24 months; 116 boys, 59 girls. </P>
<P>Inclusion criteria: history of 'asthma-like' symptoms, including but not limited to cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath; or a history of physician-diagnosed asthma. </P>
<P>Exclusion: born premature, unresolved respiratory tract infection, any serious condition requiring hospitalisation or emergency room visits in the within 4 weeks, or an asthma exacerbation within 2 weeks of pre-study visit.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>6 weeks of 4mg montelukast (oral granules) or matching placebo, given once a day. Trial medications were given with one tablespoon of apple sauce at bedtime.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-08-01 13:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Safety and tolerability of trial medications. Secondary endpoints were efficacy endpoints: days without beta agonist use, beta agonist use per day, total peripheral blood eosinophil count, number of unscheduled physician, emergency room or hospital visits due to worsening 'asthma' symptoms, oral corticosteroid rescues for asthma' symptoms, asthma attacks (composite of unscheduled visits and oral steroid rescues) and discontinuations due to worsening 'asthma symptoms'. Carers recorded details daily on a modified calender. Authors considered secondary endpoints exploratory outcomes.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Study was included as cough was an inclusion factor and diagnosis of asthma in the age group of participants is controversial. </P>
<P>Study's primary author was contacted but did not respond to request for additional data.</P>
