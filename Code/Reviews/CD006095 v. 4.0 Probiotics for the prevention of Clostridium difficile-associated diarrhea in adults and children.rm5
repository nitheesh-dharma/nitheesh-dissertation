Antibiotic treatment may disturb the balance of organisms that normally populate the gut. This can result in a range of symptoms, most notably, diarrhea. <I>Clostridium difficile</I> (<I>C. difficile</I>) is a particularly dangerous organism that may colonize the gut if the normal healthy balance has been disturbed. <I>Clostridium difficile-</I>related disease varies from asymptomatic infection, diarrhea, colitis, and pseudo-membranous colitis to toxic megacolon and death. The cost of treatment is expensive and the financial burden on the medical system is substantial.</P><P><B>What are probiotics?</B> </P><P>Probiotics are live organisms (bacteria or yeast). thought to improve the balance of organisms that populate the gut, counteracting potential disturbances to the gut microbial balance that are associated with antibiotic use, and reducing the risk of colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Probiotics can be found in dietary supplements or yogurts and are becoming increasingly available as capsules sold in health food stores and supermarkets. As 'functional food' or 'good bacteria', probiotics have been suggested as a means of both preventing and treating <I>C. difficile</I>-associated diarrhea (CDAD).</P><P><B>What did the researchers investigate?</B> </P><P>The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent CDAD in adults and children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to 21 March 2017.</P><P><B>What did the researchers find?</B> </P><P>This review includes 39 randomized trials with a total of 9955 participants. Thirty-one studies (8672 participants) assessed the effectiveness of probiotics for preventing CDAD among participants taking antibiotics. Our results suggest that when probiotics are given with antibiotics the risk of developing CDAD is reduced by 60% on average. Among trials enrolling participants at high risk of developing CDAD (&gt; 5%), the potential benefit of probiotics is more pronounced with a 70% risk reduction on average. Side effects were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our results suggest that taking probiotics does not increase the risk of developing side effects. The most common side effects reported in these studies include abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics. </P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:10:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:09:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as <I>Clostridium difficile </I>(<I>C. difficile)</I>.

The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of <I>C. difficile</I> infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high &gt; 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:10:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of &gt; 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk &gt; 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of <I>C. difficile </I>in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. <I>C. difficile</I> infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. </P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:10:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk &gt;5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk &#8804;5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-12-14 12:26:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:11:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:11:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Antibiotics are among the most prescribed medications worldwide.

Finally, evidence for this subgroup effect is based on between study comparisons only. In sum, the evidence for the credibility of this subgroup effect is mixed.

Much of the data for the overall effect estimate involves trials with high baseline risk (e.g. five trials had a baseline CDAD risk of &gt; 15%) and therefore we conducted a subgroup analysis to address concerns of indirectness of evidence when applying our results to lower and more typical baseline risk estimates. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0-2% and 3-5% did not show statistically significant effects but trials with a baseline risk of &gt;5% demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction, a treatment effect that is statistically significant warranting high certainty in the estimate of effect. After applying a series of subgroup credibility assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2014</LINK>), we believe it is plausible that baseline risk may be a trustworthy subgroup effect, but caution is warranted. Since there is some residual uncertainty in our estimate of effect due to heterogeneity (i.e. post hoc subgroup) and imprecision (a modest sample size and a modest number of events), while minimal individually, when viewed together we have graded the certainty in effect of the CDAD for the &gt;5% subgroup down one level to moderate. Although 16 probiotic products were administered across the 39 eligible trials suggesting a potential issue with indirect evidence with respect the optimal probiotic intervention, we did not find credible evidence to suggest a related subgroup effect (see above).</P><P>We downgraded the overall certainty of evidence for detection of <I>C. difficile</I> in stool to moderate because of imprecision; the total event rate among all 15 studies was sparse (197) and the 95% confidence interval includes both no effect and a substantial effect size. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for length of hospital stay to moderate because we suspected selective outcome reporting bias as only four of the identified trials, most of which occurred in hospitals, reported on length of hospital stay - a presumably important patient and hospital outcome.</P><P>We downgraded the overall certainty of evidence for the incidence of AAD to low because of evidence suggesting the risk of publication bias; a visual inspection of the funnel plot and statistical assessment via Harbord linear regression test were suggestive of small study effects (P = 0.03) and there was statistically significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%; P &lt; 0.01). We believe some of this heterogeneity may be explained by a credible adult versus child subgroup effect. We therefore also conducted GRADE analysis for this subgroup. We downgraded the certainty of evidence of AAD in adults to low because statistically significant heterogeneity was still detected (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%; P &lt; 0.01), and visual inspection of the funnel plot and statistical assessment via Harbord linear regression test were suggestive of small study effects (e.g. publication bias) (P = 0.02). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for the outcome AAD in children to moderate due to a risk of publication bias. While the Harbord's linear regression test was underpowered to detect a significant interaction in the studies investigating AAD in children (n=6), visual inspection of the funnel plot was somewhat suggestive for publication bias and the inclusion criteria for this systematic review was specific to CDAD and not AAD. Indeed, we recently published a Cochrane review on probiotics for the prevention of AAD in children that identified 23 RCTs totaling 3938 children, almost 3000 more children than we have identified in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2015</LINK>).<BR/></P><P>We downgraded the overall certainty of evidence for adverse events to very low because of risk of bias, heterogeneity and publication bias. First, the improvement in AEs seen in the primary analysis did not withstand our sensitivity analysis for missing outcome data and a subgroup analysis suggested a trend (P = 0.06) of a subgroup difference along risk of bias with low risk of bias studies suggesting no difference in AEs between probiotics and control. Second, there was statistically significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 49%; P &lt; 0.01). Finally, visual inspection of the funnel plot and statistical analysis using the Harbord linear regression test were suggestive of small study effects (e.g. publication bias).

We identified 31 randomised controlled trials (8672 participants) investigating this clinical question. A complete case analysis of these trials suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60% (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; random-effects). These results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of worst plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and were similar whether considering trials in adults or children, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, inpatient versus outpatient status, or higher versus lower risk of bias. However, it is important to note that the largest study in this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2013</LINK>; n = 2810 participants complete case) failed to find a statistically significant effect and the baseline risk for CDAD was very low (1.2%). Because our overall effect estimate was influenced by five trials with a CDAD baseline risk of greater than 15%, we are concerned that the effect estimate may not be directly applicable to lower baseline risk scenarios, such as was found in the <LINK REF="STD-Allen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2013</LINK> trial. Therefore, we have downgraded our level of confidence in the 60% risk reduction to moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), based on our subgroup analysis to address concerns of indirectness of evidence when applying our results to lower and more typical baseline risk estimates. Studies with baseline risks ranging from 0% to 2% demonstrated a small, non-statistically significant, risk reduction of 23% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.32; P = 0.34; moderate quality evidence). Similarly, studies with a moderate baseline risk (3% to 5%) were not statistically significant but did demonstrate a large risk reduction of 47% (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.77; P = 0.30; moderate quality evidence), while studies at the highest baseline risk (&gt; 5%) showed the largest risk reduction of 70% (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42), including a statistically significant treatment effect (P = 0.01). After applying a series of subgroup credibility assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2014</LINK>), we believe it is plausible that baseline risk may be a trustworthy subgroup effect. Using the GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for probiotic use in clinical scenarios with a baseline risk of greater than 5% was moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P><P>Interestingly, while we found evidence to suggest a large risk reduction in CDAD, the pooled results of the 15 trials (1214 participants) investigating the detection of <I>Clostridium difficile</I> in stool did not show a statistically significant effect (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10). In our assessment, the evidence warrants moderate confidence in this result (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The possibility therefore arises that while probiotics seem to reduce the risk of symptomatic <I>C. difficile</I> infection and CDAD, it may not necessarily prevent colonization. This question should be investigated further in future trials and may help elucidate the mechanisms by which probiotics prevent CDAD.</P><P>Thirty-two of the included studies (8305 participants) reported on adverse events. Compared to placebo or no treatment control, our pooled analysis indicates a statistically significant decrease in risk of adverse events among the probiotic group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97), with the short-term use of probiotics in immunocompetent patients. However, concerns with risk of bias, heterogeneity, and publication bias lead us to conclude that the certainty in the evidence for this reduction in adverse events is very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P><P>Thirty-three of the included trials (8870 participants) reported on AAD. Our pooled analysis indicates a statistically significant decrease in the risk of AAD (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.70). However, there is evidence of publication bias as well as statistically significant heterogeneity across the 33 studies (P &lt; 0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%) and we rated the certainty of the evidence as low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Exploring this heterogeneity using a priori defined subgroups revealed that an adult versus child subgroup effect may explain the observed heterogeneity (test of interaction: P &lt; 0.01). Using five published criteria to evaluate subgroup effect credibility, we consider it possible that the adult versus pediatric subgroup represents a credible subgroup effect. We therefore also analysed the certainty of the subgroup effect estimates. Twenty-two of the included trials (4095 participants) reported on AAD in adults. Our pooled analysis indicates a statistically significant decrease in the risk of AAD in adults (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.72). Further unexplained heterogeneity and publication bias lead us to consider the certainty in this effect estimate to be low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Six of the included trials (1141 participants) reported on AAD in children. Our pooled analysis indicates a larger statistically significant decrease in the risk of AAD in children (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.49). The potential for publication bias in this subgroup led us to consider the certainty in this effect estimate to be moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P><P>Only four trials investigated the length of hospital stay (3484 participants). We did not find a statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay for those patients taking probiotics (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.68) (moderate certainty in evidence).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations</HEADING><P>Other investigators chose not to pool trials using different species or strains of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD (<LINK REF="REF-Dendukuri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dendukuri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2014</LINK>). In contrast, we chose to do so as we started with the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of various probiotics was similar and that any variation in effect would be due to chance. In investigating the heterogeneity of effect size, we indeed found that the observed variability was consistent with that expected from chance (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). However, non-significant tests of statistical heterogeneity do not necessarily preclude significant clinical heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1994</LINK>), so we considered the possibility of species or strain differences in subgroup analysis (as well as a priori subgroups to explore the potential influence of population setting and age, probiotic dose and risk of bias). We applied five published criteria to investigate subgroup effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2014</LINK>), and did not find convincing evidence to suggest the presence of species or strain specific differences of the effect on CDAD. However, we did find a subgroup effect for AAD based on age (adults versus children). The subgroup hypothesis was sufficiently credible that it should be addressed in future studies.</P><P>There was significant missing data from multiple trials both in regards to patients lost to follow-up as well as the investigators&#8217; success in testing all fecal samples. To investigate the possible effect this might have had on our conclusions, we subjected this missing data to assumptions based on an extensive, but plausible sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akl-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2013</LINK>). Our findings of reduced CDAD and AAD risk were robust to all sensitivity assumptions, while our findings of reduced risk of AEs were not.</P><P>The largest study in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2013</LINK>), did not find a statistically significant effect of probiotics for CDAD reduction, presumably because the study was underpowered due to the unexpected low baseline risk of developing CDAD (1.2%). Based on our post hoc subgroup analysis exploring the efficacy of probiotics among patients stratified by low, moderate and high baseline risk of CDAD, we downgraded the certainty in our overall effect estimate for indirectness of evidence from a population level baseline risk perspective. The subgroup hypothesis was sufficiently credible that it should be addressed in future studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Strengths</HEADING><P>We conducted an extensive literature search and identified 39 trials (9955 participants) for analysis. For the most patient important CDAD outcome, we investigated statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and found that the variation in effect sizes was compatible with that expected from chance (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). We followed recently developed consensus guidelines on heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2014</LINK>), and investigated the possibilities of subgroup effects including the risk of bias using five published criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2014</LINK>). As suggested above, we also subjected missing participant data to a range of plausible assumptions, including worst plausible (assumed ratio of event rates 5:1) sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2012</LINK>). Because a correlation is sometimes observed between smaller trials and a more positive estimation of intervention effect, it is important to investigate possible &#8216;small study effects&#8217; often referred to as publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2000</LINK>). In line with small study effect guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>), we opted to use the Harbord method which, while conceptually similar to the more familiar Egger method (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), utilizes the efficient score and its variance and therefore avoids certain mathematical concerns inherent in the Egger method (<LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>). We independently applied GRADE criteria to determine the certainty in the estimate of effect for each of our outcomes and plausible subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). Finally, CDAD incidence rates among many of the included trials were far above what would be expected in a hospital setting, which resulted in questions from clinicians and public health officials about the external validity of our previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2013</LINK>). Optimally, we would have used cut-offs based on incidence densities (e.g. by 1000 patient days) as routinely used by infection prevention and control programs to guide decision making based on institutional baseline data, but the published studies consistently used incidence rates. There are no commonly accepted cut-offs for &#8216;low&#8217;, &#8216;medium&#8217;, and &#8216;high&#8217; incidence of <I>C. difficile</I> infection, therefore, we used equal 3% increments to divide our data into three subgroups, an approach that had face validity as per our content expert (DM). These incremental subgroups will allow institutions to decide on the potential benefit of probiotic prophylaxis based on incidence data at their institution.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-14 12:26:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>We previously reported a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2013</LINK>). Among the 23 included randomized trials, the pooled effect estimate reported as a risk ratio was 0.36, which is very close to our pooled estimate. This updated Cochrane review identified an additional eight trials reporting on CDAD and six trials reporting on adverse events, thus increasing the precision of our earlier results and further increasing the overall certainty in the estimate of effect. This updated review has included additional outcomes of interest to decision-makers, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and the length of hospital stay.</P><P>Among five clinical practice guidelines produced by leading authoritative organizations, guidelines currently do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies, including antibiotic stewardship, hypochlorite solutions, and bundle strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Lytvyn-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lytvyn 2016</LINK>). Guidelines cited concerns regarding insufficient evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Debast-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Debast 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surawicz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surawicz 2013</LINK>), safety concerns (<LINK REF="REF-Debast-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Debast 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dubberke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubberke 2014</LINK>), and too much weight given to studies with high baseline CDAD (<LINK REF="REF-Dubberke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubberke 2014</LINK>). Our subgroup analysis on baseline risk indicates that probiotics have moderate quality evidence if the risk of CDAD is greater than 5% and low to moderate quality evidence if the risk is less than or equal to 5%. Despite very low quality evidence for the observed decreased risk in adverse events when using probiotics, among 32 RCTs reporting on potential harms, no serious adverse events were attributed to probiotics. The most comprehensive systematic review to date on the safety of probiotics included all study designs involving humans and found no statistically significantly difference in the overall number of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.07), including serious adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.16; 66 RCTs primarily based on <I>Lactobacillus spp</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Hempel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hempel 2012</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:16:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-14 08:16:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Moderate quality evidence supports a large protective effect for probiotics (e.g. <I>S. boulardii</I> or <I>L. acidophilus</I> plus <I>L casei</I> at a dose of 10 to 50 billion CFUs per day) in preventing <I>Clostridium difficile-</I>associated diarrhea. A post hoc subgroup analysis suggests that probiotics may be more effective for people with a higher baseline risk of CDAD (&gt; 5% risk; NNTB = 12; moderate quality evidence) than for people with a lower baseline risk of CDAD (<U>&lt;</U> 5% risk). Stated in absolute terms, probiotic prophylaxis would prevent 85 <I>Clostridium difficile-</I>associated diarrhea episodes per 1000 patients at high risk of <I>C. difficile</I> diarrhea.

Future head-to-head trials are warranted to distinguish optimal strains and dosages, including the assessment of cost effectiveness of probiotics compared to alternative drugs. These trials should be vigilant regarding minimizing losses to follow-up particularly for <I>Clostridium difficile</I> infection results among patients with an episode of diarrhea. Covariates of clinical interest such as age, baseline risk, length of hospitalization, length of antibiotic treatment, antibiotic class, and probiotic strain and dose, for example, need to be evaluated further. While further trials enrolling patients at high baseline risk for <I>C. difficile-</I>associated diarrhea may not be required, more trials among patients at low and moderate baseline risk are needed.

We chose Yazoo as placebo because it looks identical in colour and consistency to Actimel... The pharmacies removed the commercial labels, then applied study labels to identify the patient, the drink&#8217;s &#8220;use by&#8221; date, and storage instructions. We could not find a placebo in an identical bottle to Actimel. Patients and researchers were blind to the study drink as they did not see the bottle the drink came in. Nursing staff dispensed the drinks and were instructed to pour 100 ml into a cup for the patient; they were not told which bottle contained which drink. Older people in the UK are not generally familiar with these products, but it is possible some patients might have recognized the taste. However, we had excluded people who regularly took this or other probiotic products from the study. Potential bias through unblinding was possible but unlikely&#8221;</P><P> </P><P>While there is potential for unblinding here the risk of &#8216;material&#8217; bias is unclear and would depend on how many participants could identify based on taste and/or the interactions of nursing staff who may have recognized the bottles with the researchers and participants. Outcomes from this study which are pertinent to our review include AE (which we consider to be a subjective outcome) and CDAD (which we consider to be an objective outcome).
