<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-25 15:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Drug therapy might improve recovery from loss of language function (aphasia) after stroke, but no drug has yet been proven to do more good than harm. Aphasia is a common problem after stroke. Speech and language therapy (SLT) from a speech and language therapist is the most common treatment for this disorder. A number of drugs have been used to try and improve language recovery. This review of 10 studies evaluated six different drugs. The only drug for which there was any evidence of benefit was piracetam, but the evidence of benefit was weak and there were concerns about its safety. It was not possible to conclude whether piracetam was more effective than speech and language therapy in treating aphasia after stroke. More research is needed into the effects of piracetam on aphasia, and its safety, before it can be recommended for routine use.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-24 15:29:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched: May 2001), and reference lists of relevant articles to December 1998. We also contacted academic institutions and other researchers to identify further published and unpublished trials. MEDLINE was searched from 1966 to 1998, and CINAHL from 1982 to 1998. We handsearched the <I>International Journal of Disorders of Communication</I> from 1969 to 1998.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-09-24 15:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing (1) any drug given to improve language versus no treatment or versus placebo, (2) any drug given to improve language versus speech and language therapy, and (3) one drug given to improve language versus another drug given with the same aim.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-25 16:00:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One reviewer collected the data, and assessed the quality of the trials with independent data checking and methodological advice. If we could not perform a statistical combination of different studies, we sought missing data. Failing that, we provided a description.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-25 16:00:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 10 trials in the review. Generally, we were unable to assess methodological quality; only one trial reported sufficient detail for analysis. Drugs used were piracetam, bifemalane, piribedil, bromocriptine, idebenone, and Dextran 40. We found weak evidence that patients were more likely to have improved on any language measure at the end of the trial if they had received treatment with piracetam (odds ratio (OR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 0.7). Patients who were treated with piracetam were no more likely than those who took a placebo to experience unwanted effects, including death (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.7). However, the differences in death rates between the two groups give rise to some concerns that there may be an increased risk of death from taking piracetam. We could not determine if drug treatment is more effective than speech and language therapy. We could not determine whether one drug is more effective than another.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-24 15:36:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Drug treatment with piracetam may be effective in the treatment of aphasia after stroke. Further research is needed to explore the effects of drugs for aphasia, in particular piracetam. The safety of the drug should be of primary interest. Researchers should examine the long-term effects and whether it is more effective than speech and language therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-25 15:18:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Aphasia, a term which is used interchangeably with dysphasia, describes linguistic impairment associated with a brain lesion. Stroke is the major cause of aphasia. There is ongoing debate about the cortical location of neurological components which contribute to communication and language, and the actual mechanisms disrupted by a stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Frequency</HEADING>
<P>Estimates of the incidence, prevalence and impact of aphasia following stroke vary and are uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 1992</LINK>). An estimated 11,400 people become aphasic following stroke every year in Britain (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1986</LINK>). Wade et al noted that aphasia was present in one quarter of conscious patients who had suffered a stroke within the previous seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1986</LINK>). The Scandinavian Stroke Study found that 38% of stroke patients were aphasic on admission to hospital, and 18% of stroke survivors had some degree of aphasia on discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Pederson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pederson 1995</LINK>). The symptoms of stroke frequently persist and 12% of the survivors of stroke are still aphasic at six months (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1986</LINK>). The prevalence of persisting speech and language disorders 6 months following stroke has been estimated to be between 30 and 50 per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Usually it is the remit of speech and language therapists (formerly known as speech therapists in the UK, known as speech pathologists in the USA) to assess and treat people with aphasia, and this is the subject of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2001</LINK>). In addition, however, a number of drugs have been utilised with the aim of ameliorating language functions after stroke. Nevertheless, the role of pharmacotherapy is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Bachman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachman 1990</LINK>), and the diverse theories of the neurological deficits underlying aphasia have given rise to different pharmacologic rationales for therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Drugs and their possible mechanisms of action</HEADING>
<P>The agents that have been used include meprobomate which has tranquillising and muscle relaxing effects, and L-Dopa, a dopaminergic agent, which is used to reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (<LINK REF="REF-Methe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Methe 1993</LINK>). Bromocriptine, also a dopamine agonist, has also been administered to aphasic patients with some evidence of success, albeit from a small group before-and-after study (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1992</LINK>). There is, therefore, some reason to suppose that dopamine has a positive effect on language.</P>
<P>Recently, interest has developed in the use of piracetam. This substance belongs to a unique pharmacological class known as nootropic, which affects various mental functions. A review of the uses to which piracetam has been put claimed that it improves higher cerebral integrative functions, including those involved in cognitive processes such as learning and memory (<LINK REF="REF-Giurgea-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giurgea 1976</LINK>). This review, however, was not systematic, and findings should not, therefore, be considered conclusive. It has also been postulated that, in order to facilitate improvement in these cognitive processes, piracetam restores the fluidity of the neuronal membrane (<LINK REF="STD-Muller-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Muller 1994</LINK>), and that piracetam may improve the microcirculation both centrally and peripherally, for various reasons advanced by a number of researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>). A number of studies have suggested that piracetam has favourable effects on mental and motor function in patients who have suffered a stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Stolyarova-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolyarova 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Creytens-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creytens 1980</LINK>). Piracetam has been used in other circumstances, for example to improve reading ability and comprehension in dyslexic children (<LINK REF="REF-Wilsher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilsher 1987</LINK>), and alertness and memory in elderly patients with cognitive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Steginck-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steginck 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1983</LINK>). It is licensed in the UK for prescription for the treatment of cortical myoclonus.</P>
<P>It can be argued that there will be spontaneous recovery from the brain lesion after stroke, which may well account for any improvement in language function documented using observational research methods: these are, however, the most frequently used research methods in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Whurr-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whurr 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is therefore the aim of this review to draw on the evidence of 'experimental' design studies in order to assess the effectiveness of any pharmacological substance given with the expressed aim of ameliorating language function(s), to people who are aphasic after stroke.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>The reports of studies formally reviewed were limited to those described as randomised controlled trials, even where the method of randomisation had not been specified. Ideally, a method of randomisation should have been used which ensured that those recruiting participants for the trial could not influence the assignment in any way. When it was unclear whether or not there was adequate allocation concealment the authors were contacted for further clarification. There was no language restriction. In addition, only those trials with a pre-stated aim of specifically examining the effects of a drug on language function were considered eligible for formal review. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Of these, 55 studies were considered and rejected from the review as ineligible on at least one criterion for the review. Twenty-two of these were ineligible because it was clear they had used a methodology which was not a randomised controlled trial. Five of the studies judged ineligible on methodological grounds gave insufficient details of methodology to be certain what type of methods had been used. Two randomised controlled trials were rejected because the cross over design resulted in uncertainty about the effects of the intervention: learning effects from the first phase of the trials could have clouded the results from the second phase. Fifteen were rejected on methodological grounds alone, and 25 studies were rejected because they had not evaluated the effect of the intervention on aphasia separately from its effect on other disabilities. Thirteen studies were ineligible because they did not meet patient inclusion criteria: three had included patients with both head injury and stroke, three had included patients with dysarthria and/or aphasia, one included patients with apraxia, not aphasia. Of those judged ineligible on methodological grounds, eight had used a single case observational approach, studying either one patient, or a small group of patients, and five had used a before and after design with a single group of patients. Three studies were purely observational, one of these being retrospective, and one study comprised a review of past research. Two studies were judged ineligible on three or more grounds (methodological, patient type, intervention type, outcome). The range of years in which the excluded studies were published was from 1965 to 1997, with 37 of them taking place in the 1980s or 1990s.</P>

Aaachen Aphasia Test (AAT, <LINK REF="REF-Huber-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huber 1983</LINK>) was used in Enderby (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>) and Poeck (<LINK REF="STD-Poeck-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Poeck 1993</LINK>). This test is a psychometrically validated assessment developed using linguistic principles, allowing the detail of language breakdown to be described. Each of the following was used in only one trial: The Boston Naming Test (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1983</LINK>), used by Gupta (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1995</LINK>); the Frenchay Aphasia Test (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1987</LINK>), used by De Reuck (<LINK REF="STD-De-Reuck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">De Reuck 1995</LINK>); and the Japanese Standard Language Test (<LINK REF="REF-SLTA-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">SLTA 1977</LINK>), used by Tanaka (<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1997</LINK>). Unstandardised language measures, measures of psychological functioning and a measure of depression in patients were each reported only once, and are not considered in this section.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the trials entered for the review varied between trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of randomisation process</HEADING>
<P>One trial gave insufficient detail of the randomisation process in the published report, but contact with the author revealed that the randomisation was organised from a central location (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>). Patient identification was taken prior to randomisation to ensure there could be no cross over - or to indicate if there had been. The other nine studies gave insufficient details to be absolutely certain the trialists had ensured concealment of allocation. Four studies gave some details of the randomisation process. In the trial by De Reuck patients were stratified by centre (<LINK REF="STD-De-Reuck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">De Reuck 1995</LINK>). Spudis (<LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>) used random number tables and Tanaka (<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1997</LINK>) used coin-toss to allocate patients. In the remaining trials it is only stated that the patients were randomly allocated. Although authors have been contacted, no further details have so far been made available to the review team. Two trials, Bakchine (<LINK REF="STD-Bakchine-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakchine 1990</LINK>), and Gupta (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1995</LINK>), used cross over methodology. Only the results from the first, pre-cross-over period of the study are considered in the review, as any improvements in people during the second period could have been due to a learning effect carried over from the first period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bias</HEADING>
<P>The trials were assessed to determine to what degree they had eliminated the following types of bias.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>This appears to have been eliminated from nine of the 10 trials, or five out of the six comparisons. As far as it is possible to tell, all nine were double blinded with patients unaware of their treatment status, and with both groups of patients in each trial receiving identical co-interventions. Enderby (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>) made efforts to minimise centre differences. However in the trial of bifemelane (<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1997</LINK>) and in the trial of Dextran 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>), it appeared that the patients in the control group did not receive a placebo. Because of this, patients would therefore have been aware of their treatment status: patients would have given informed consent to be randomly assigned to receiving a treatment or not, and would then have been aware that they fell into the group not receiving treatment, since a placebo does not appear to have used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion bias</HEADING>
<P>In two trials, analysis is by intention to treat, and there appears to have been no exclusion bias (<LINK REF="STD-De-Reuck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">De Reuck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1993</LINK>). In the Herrschaft study, four (9%) of the total number randomised were lost to follow up because of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Herrschaft-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herrschaft 1988</LINK>). In the Enderby study, the number of patients available for analysis dropped between the start of the trial and the 12-week assessment from 67 to 30 (55% lost) in the treatment group, and from 70 to 36 (49% lost) in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>). By the 24-week assessment these numbers had dropped to 20 and 21 respectively (70% lost from the original numbers in both cases). Further details have been sought from the author, who reports that the drop outs were mainly associated with patients attending European centres remote from their home base (a common occurrence in some countries). They were lost to follow up at various points due to being relocated to their home district which was too remote for them to remain in the trial. In the study by Poeck et al, the patients of interest have not been separated for the purposes of analysis from other patients ineligible for this review. However an overall figure of 16% drop out is given for this study, patients being mainly lost because they did not fulfil the protocol stipulations or they withdrew consent (<LINK REF="STD-Poeck-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Poeck 1993</LINK>). In the study by Spudis, nine patients were lost to follow up in the treatment group - one patient was excluded after the start of the study because of a serious adverse event, and eight patients died (27% lost to follow up). In the control group six patients died (21% lost) (<LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>). All patients randomised were followed up in the studies by Gupta (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1995</LINK>), and Tanaka (<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1997</LINK>). Details of events giving rise to suspicion of exclusion bias are not given in the trial by Backchine (<LINK REF="STD-Bakchine-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakchine 1990</LINK>) or Price (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Gupta (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1995</LINK>) and Enderby (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>) gave information about the blinding of the testing therapists, who were not aware of the treatment status of the patients. The assessors in Spudis (<LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>) assessors were probably blinded, and Tanaka (<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1997</LINK>) blinded the assessing speech therapist until the second evaluation. No details concerning the blinding of assessors were available in the remaining studies. If the person assessing the patient is aware of the treatment status of the patient, it is possible that assessments were biased.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Potential conflicts of interest</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials gives a statement about potential conflict of interest. It is possible that the manufacturers of drugs used in the trials were overly involved in the trials.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-25 15:19:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The objectives of this review were to examine whether drug therapy was more effective for people who have aphasia following stroke than no drug support; whether drug therapy gave a better outcome than speech and language therapy alone; and whether a particular drug regimen performed better than another in this respect.</P>
<P>In order to identify the trials included in this review, a considerable number of study reports were appraised and rejected for a variety of reasons. It should be noted that, in the context of this review, no exhaustive or systematic attempt has been made to identify all non-randomised studies of drug treatment for aphasia after stroke.</P>
<P>The quality and size of most of the eligible trials identified are such that any conclusions from this review are highly tentative. There were no eligible studies comparing speech and language therapy with a drug, and none comparing one drug with another.</P>
<P>For only one drug/placebo comparison was more than one trial identified. Since data were missing, not given in an appropriate form, or were from one small study only, it is possible therefore to come to a tentative conclusion about this one drug only (piracetam). However, lack of evidence of the effect of any of the interventions reviewed does not mean that the review has identified evidence of no effect.</P>
<P>Those agents which were single examples from various classes of drugs were idebenone, an antioxidant believed to prevent cell death, and Dextran 40 which is a glucose polymer used to expand plasma volume.</P>
<P>Four of the six drugs identified in the trials could be grouped together in pairs according to family or action: piracetam and bifemelane, from the nootropic class, are both believed to be metabolic activators, which may improve cognitive function, and/or act as neuroprotectors. Bromocriptine and piribedil are both dopamine agonists, which activate cerebral function. Claims by authors of a trial of the nootropic compound bifemelane about the benefits of this substance could not be verified from the report of the study.</P>
<P>It is possible to examine the results from the piracetam trials in more detail. Data were available for four of the five trials which studied the effects of piracetam. Only one of the trials can be considered large (<LINK REF="STD-De-Reuck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">De Reuck 1995</LINK>). In spite of suspicions that the subgroup analysis of the aphasic patients in this study may have been performed post hoc, there is no certainty of this, and the decision was taken to include these patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>) lost a large proportion of patients to follow up for reasons which were later clarified through personal communications to be largely due to practical issues. The four trials were therefore judged sufficiently homogeneous to be considered together. Meta-analysis indicated that those with aphasia who received piracetam following a stroke were more likely to have their aphasia improved at the end of the study than those who received a placebo.</P>
<P>Enderby also gave the results of a number of sub-scales of a test, but in only one case (repetition test at 24 weeks), out of a total of 22 considered, was a statistically significant difference found, in favour of piracetam, and only 31 patients were available for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Enderby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Enderby 1994</LINK>). The very large proportion of patients lost to follow up in this trial precludes reliable intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Patients treated with piracetam were not more likely than those given placebo to experience adverse effects (no statistically significant differences, although the confidence intervals are wide). The study reports identified do not give any information about the benefits or disadvantages of piracetam in the long term. It is possible that the benefit of piracetam is lost if it is taken for months rather than weeks, although it is also feasible that the drug could have a greater benefit if given for a longer rather than shorter period.</P>
<P>However this review did find a non significant increase in deaths in the piracetam treated group. A Cochrane review of the effect of piracetam in acute stroke found a statistically non-significant increase in the odds of death with piracetam (<LINK REF="REF-Ricci-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricci 2000</LINK>). Ricci raises the possibility that in the trials they considered, there may have been an imbalance at baseline, resulting in more patients with more severe strokes being allocated to piracetam. An alternative, unproven hypothesis could be that the patients with the more severe strokes (and so more likely to have severe aphasia) allocated piracetam, were more likely to die, hence biasing the results - in survivors - in favour of piracetam.</P>
<P>Potential conflicts of interest, where the manufacturers may have been overly involved in trials, could give rise to some doubts about impartiality of the reporting of the trials identified.</P>
<P>We have chosen to concentrate on evidence from randomised controlled trials to minimise the likelihood of being misled by bias; the problem in interpretation is that all estimates of effect are very imprecise. Reviews based on a wider literature will be less prone to imprecision, but the problem with their interpretation is that the estimates are much more likely to be biased.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-09-25 15:19:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>It is not possible, based on the results of this review, to give prescribing advice to doctors who manage patients who are aphasic following stroke. Speech and language therapists cannot prescribe, but this review found no basis for advising that any drug is either superior or inferior to speech and language therapy. The findings concerning piracetam may be of interest to doctors, therapists, patients and carers, but it should be noted that piracetam is not licensed for prescription in the UK for people with aphasia (it is licensed for prescription to people with cortical myoclonus). Piracetam can be obtained without prescription in parts of Europe and the US, and is also available through the World Wide Web.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-25 15:20:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All the drugs identified in this review have been under-studied. The only drug which appears to give some promise based on this review is piracetam. While no conclusive evidence about the benefit of piracetam could be identified, it would appear that there is sufficiently rigorously established information to encourage further research of this particular substance. If researchers wish to respond to this, consideration should be given to a large multi-centre trial, with sufficient attention paid to patients' language performance in the short and long term. Outcome measures used should be robust.</P>
<P>The contrasting effects of piracetam compared to speech and language therapy could also be usefully studied, and would avoid the need to randomise patients to a 'no treatment' group. Alternatively., speech and language therapy could be given to both groups of patients, with only one group receiving piracetam. Ethical objections to the withholding of speech and language therapy treatment could thus be avoided.</P>
<P>Outcomes focusing on the views and perceptions of the patients and those who care for them should be used in any further studies of treatment for aphasia.</P>
<P>There are a number of methodological traps that any researcher undertaking such a trial would need to take care to avoid, wherever possible. For example trialists must be clear about whether they are evaluating the effects of a drug on stroke recovery generally, or just on language recovery. Assessment of outcome should be blinded, and any side effects should be reported. In view of some (unproven) concerns about the selective culling of severely aphasic patients, numbers of patients 'dead or aphasic at end of trial' should be reported.</P>
<P>Care should be taken to ensure full randomisation, with blinding of outcome.</P>

<P>Aphasic participants were assessed with the Frenchay Aphasia Test (FAST, Enderby 1987). Tests of neurological functioning (Orgogozo 1983), and behaviour (Barthel Index, Mahoney 1965) were also given, the analysis being performed on an intention-to-treat basis, with missing data estimated by the last available score. The authors report that a statistically significant difference was found in favour of the treated aphasic group on the FAST test at day 84 (the level of significance is variously reported in the papers written concerning this study). The authors also report that no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups on other parameters tested in the study population as a whole.<BR/>However in a predefined sub-group analysis of a group who were aphasic, and treated within 7 hours of the stroke, the authors reported statistically significant differences in language function on aphasia testing, and in other parameters of functioning at the end of the study period, in favour of the treated group.<BR/>A post hoc analysis of the early treated group reportedly showed that those treated within 7 hours of the stroke performed better on treatment than on placebo if they were originally diagnosed as having a moderate to marked impairment. This difference in favour of piracetam did not apply to those with mild impairment.</P>
<P>No difference in mortality rates was found for the population as a whole, and it is not possible to separate those who had an adverse event and died later, from those experiencing only an adverse event. Death rates for the aphasic participants are not reported separately.<BR/>An economic analysis showed that total cost per participant was lower in the treated group than in the placebo group.</P>

The principal test of language performance was the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT, Huber 1983), which was broken down into sub-scales, with scores given for each. Authors report that differences between the two groups approached significance at 12 weeks in certain sub tests of the AAT (written language and comprehension).
