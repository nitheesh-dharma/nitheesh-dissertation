<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:17:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael Lunn">
<P>Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF-I) is a genetically engineered human protein. Theoretically, it is expected to enhance the survival of motor neurons which degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as motor neuron disease (MND)). It is given by daily subcutaneous injection (injection under the skin). Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 779 participants measured disease progression on special clinical rating scales of disease severity in ALS. The review authors collected data about adverse events from the included trials. The combined results from the two included studies that used the rating scale (AALSRS) showed a small significant benefit in favour of rhIGF-I. Significant flaws in the trial designs make the statistically significant benefits in some outcomes of questionable relevance. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I. A third study using a different outcome measure showed no difference between treatment and placebo. Taken together, the available RCTs do not provide information supporting the hypothesis that rhIGF-I is an effective disease modifying treatment for ALS. All three included studies showed a high risk of bias. These issues very seriously detracted from the ability of this review to fulfil its objectives.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered all randomised controlled clinical trials involving rhIGF-I treatment of adults with definite or probable ALS according to the El Escorial Criteria. The primary outcome measure was change in Appel Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Rating Scale (AALSRS) total score after nine months of treatment and secondary outcome measures were change in AALSRS at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 months, change in quality of life (Sickness Impact Profile scale), survival and adverse events.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of rhIGF-I, involving 779 participants, for inclusion in the analysis. In a European trial (183 participants) the mean difference (MD) in change in AALSRS total score after nine months was -3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.68 to 2.08). In a North American trial (266 participants), the MD after nine months was -6.00 (95% CI -10.99 to -1.01). The combined analysis from both RCTs showed a MD after nine months of -4.75 (95% CI -8.41 to -1.09), a significant difference in favour of the treated group. The secondary outcome measures showed non-significant trends favouring rhIGF-I. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54). . A second North American trial (330 participants) used a novel primary end point involving manual muscle strength testing. No differences were demonstrated between the treated and placebo groups in this study. All three trials were at high risk of bias.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:18:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael Lunn">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease, known in some countries, including the UK, as motor neuron disease (MND) and characterised by weakness in limb and bulbar muscles with atrophy, spasticity, weight loss and ultimately respiratory failure. The incidence is between 1.5 and 2.0/100,000 per year, and it is estimated that there are just over 1,000 new patients per year in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1998</LINK>) and 25,000 patients in North America (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1996</LINK>). The prevalence is about 6 per 100,000 with a median survival of 2.6 years from first symptom to death in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1998</LINK>) with a prevalence of 4 to 6 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Bharucha-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bharucha 1983</LINK>) and median survival of three years in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Haverkamp-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haverkamp 1995</LINK>). There is a combination of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron abnormalities, with relentless progression of functional impairment in most patients.</P>
<P>The burden of the disease upon patients, family members and caregivers is huge with increasing cost burdens associated with increasing disability and the need for assisted medical care. At present, disease-specific therapy can at best only slow disease progression and does not stabilise or improve the underlying disorder.</P>
<P>There have been many controlled trials of disease-specific therapy for ALS. Until recently, all were negative. The results of randomised trials of riluzole have resulted in the licensing of this drug as a disease modifying treatment for ALS in a number of countries.</P>
<P>Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) is a naturally occurring peptide with multi-target neurotrophic potential on motor neurons as well as the neuromuscular junction and muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1993</LINK>). Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I has promoted the survival of spinal and facial motor neurons in experimental models of peripheral nerve transection and excitatory amino acid induced cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Caroni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caroni 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neff 1993</LINK>) and has also promoted peripheral nerve regeneration in motor nerve axotomy models (<LINK REF="REF-Caroni-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caroni 1990</LINK>). Wobbler mice (a putative animal model for ALS) treated with rhIGF-I showed weight gain associated with increased grip strength and increased mean muscle fibre diameter without evidence of an increase in numbers of motor neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Hantai-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hantai 1995</LINK>). Receptors for rhIGF-I have been reported to be up-regulated in the spinal cord of people who have died of ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Adem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adem 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dore 1996</LINK>). These studies provided the background for randomised placebo-controlled trials of rhIGF-I in ALS. More recently it has been reported that delivery of rhIGF-I to motor neurons using rhIGF-I expressing adeno-associated virus as a vector in G93A SOD1 transgenic mice prolongs life even if started after the animals have developed clinical evidence of ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Kaspar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaspar 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The goal of the present review is to examine systematically the evidence from randomised trials relating to the effects of rhIGF-I in ALS, in order to supply the best evidence currently available on which to base clinical decision making and future research.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (21 November 2011) using the following search terms 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' OR 'motor neuron disease' OR 'motor neurone disease' OR ' motoneuron disease' or 'MND' OR 'ALS' AND 'rhigf-1' OR 'insulin-like' OR 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I' or 'rhIGF-1' or 'rhigf'. We adapted this strategy to search CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4<I>),</I> MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2011 ) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2011). The review authors contacted the manufacturers of rhIGF-I and the authors of identified trials to find additional published or unpublished data to clarify issues concerning trial design and loss of patients to follow-up. The manufacturers of rhIGF-I and the authors of identified trials have not so far been able to provide full clarification of all the points raised by the review authors. We have derived values obtained by measuring published graphs presenting the results of clinical trials to fill in gaps in the data. We continue to try and obtain the missing data. Extensive attempts to obtain these missing data have unfortunately been unsuccessful.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:18:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The review authors checked titles and abstracts identified from the register. We obtained the full texts of all potentially relevant studies for independent assessment by each author. The review authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded their risk of bias. The authors of the review contacted the trial authors for clarification of data where necessary. The review authors resolved disagreements about inclusion criteria and risk of bias by discussion.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure chosen was change in disease progression as determined by the AALSRS total score (<LINK REF="REF-Appel-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1987</LINK>) after nine months of treatment. This was chosen because in the absence of full data from survival curves (the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group has selected survival at 12 months as being its preferred primary outcome measure in ALS/MND reviews) this was a parameter common to both the trials known to exist when the protocol for this review was written.</P>
<P>We independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool, described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), addressing six risk of bias domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other sources of bias'. We judged the adequacy of each study in relation to each domain, as at high, low or unclear risk of bias. The lead author undertook data extraction and the others (JHJW and GDB) checked the data extraction. We continue to attempt to obtain the substantial quantity of missing data from trial authors and manufacturers or both.</P>
<P>We calculated a treatment effect (using a fixed-effect model) across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager 5.1. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes as a function of time, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed analyses on both short-term outcomes (adverse side effects of rhIGF-I, quality of life, strength and functional scale ratings) as well as long-term outcomes (survival).</P>
<P>We tested for heterogeneity in the results across studies. If heterogeneity had been detected we would have conducted a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>It is possible that the results of included trials were confounded by dropouts having specific characteristics. We had hoped that this issue could have been addressed by making comparisons between the completers and dropouts. This would have been done by comparing outcomes in the intention to treat analysis with those based solely on participants surviving to complete the protocol. We have not yet been able to obtain the data needed to do this. If we obtain these data in the future such comparisons will be carried out according to published principles (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 11:05:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Searches produced the following numbers of papers: MEDLINE: 120 (54 new for the 2010 update), EMBASE: 39 (4 new), NMD register 13 (0 new), CENTRAL 17.</P>
<P>The search process revealed four randomised trials of rhIGF-I published in peer reviewed journals (<LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nagano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagano 2005</LINK>) was excluded because the linearity of the Norris Scale could not be assured to the same extent as even the AALSRS, the number of included participants was small, there was no placebo control, there was no primary endpoint, the number of different endpoints were such that a Bonferroni correction would have shown the findings to be insignificant at the 5% level and an intent-to-treat analysis including the three drop-out participants mentioned early in the paper was not mentioned in the results and discussion sections.</P>
<P>The three included studies comprised 467 participants treated with rhIGF-I and 312 given placebo. A North American trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>) compared rhIGF-I 0.05 mg/kg/day (89 participants randomised) and 0.1 mg/kg/day (87 participants randomised) with placebo (90 participants randomised). The European trial (<LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>) compared rhIGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day (124 participants randomised) with placebo (59 participants randomised). A second North American trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>) compared rhIGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day (167 participants randomised) with placebo (163 participants randomised).</P>
<P>There was a subtle difference between the primary endpoints used in the first North American trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>) (slope of disease progression (points/month)) and the European trial (<LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>) (change (in points) from baseline to study end, using last observation carried forward). The third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>) used a completely different primary end point based on manual muscle strength testing. This end point is not included in the protocol for this review either as a primary or secondary end point. The ALSFRS-r scale, used as a secondary end point in this trial is also not included in the protocol for this review either as a primary or secondary end point.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:18:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In all three trials, participants were randomly allocated to receive IGF-I or placebo of identical appearance. Internationally agreed diagnostic criteria were used to determine inclusion in each trial. Each trial recorded baseline demographic and clinical features. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> these were not included in the published paper, but are available in material published by the National Auxiliary Publication Service. No significant differences in treatment groups were reported although the treatment and placebo groups in the study were not well balanced. The randomised observation period was nine months, but if participants reached an AALSRS score of &gt;115 or a forced vital capacity of &lt; 39% predicted, they were withdrawn from the randomised study and offered open label medication. For these participants, along with those who died, the last AALSRS observation was carried forward for all subsequent months to the nine month planned study termination. The authors have not been able to obtain raw data which do not include these 'last observation carried forward' data and have some concern that this inhibits a fully objective evaluation of the results of these trials.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> only 42 of 90 participants randomised to placebo, 50 of 89 randomised to IGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day and 49 of 87 randomised to IGF-I 0.05 mg/kg/day completed the nine month double-blind phase. Comparable figures for <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> were 65 of 124 randomised to IGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day and 31 of 59 randomised to placebo. The authors are also aware of a number of numerical inconsistencies in data in the published papers, National Auxiliary Publications Service data and other unpublished documents available to the authors which have been produced in relation to various presentations and discussions on the trial outcomes.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK> only 65 of 167 participants randomised to IGF-I and 69 of 163 randomised to placebo completed the nine month double-blind phase. There were 168 deaths (51%) during the study. A total of 128 participants discontinued their assigned treatment for a reason other than death. Additionally, the review authors are concerned about the use of a novel primary end point in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>. This was not used in either of the other included trials either as a primary or secondary end point. Further, there is no reference in the paper reporting the trial to the previous application of the manual muscle strength testing process used in this study in previous ALS trials. Secondary outcome measures in this trial included tracheostomy free survival and ALSFRS-r score. The only outcome measures common to all three included trials for which data can be determined or adduced are survival and adverse events.</P>
<P>The authors are also concerned about the adoption of the AALSRS as the basis for the primary end point in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> because it is heterogeneous in its structure and is built from a range of ordinal and interval scales. The authors also feel that the randomised study should have extended over a period longer than nine months in these two trials. While it is possible that a 'satisfactory' result could have been obtained with a nine month randomisation period using primary end points based on the AALSRS (a variant of which was used in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK> as a secondary end point), this would presuppose adequate numbers of participants, taking into account the number of potential drop outs, to ensure adequate power. It is doubtful that this was achieved in the trials reviewed here. The authors would take the view (admittedly with the benefit of hindsight) that it would have been more appropriate to have designed the trial with more commonly used end points such as survival, with a randomisation period of at least 12 if not 18 months.</P>
<P>The only published survival data are in the National Auxiliary Publications Service data and relate to <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>. Survival data for <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> were obtained from unpublished material available to the authors which had been previously widely discussed at scientific meetings. The definition of survival i.e. death or survival to tracheostomy was not stated. Quality of life (QOL) evaluation was undertaken using the Sickness Impact Profile scale (SIP) which in the opinion of the authors is better described as a measure of functional health status. Only very scanty QOL data are presented in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>. None is given in the report on <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>A summary figure of the review authors' assessments of the risk of bias in included studies can be seen in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. There is further comment on these issues in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:50:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In a European trial with 59 participants on placebo and 124 on rhIGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day, the mean difference (MD) in AALSRS total score after nine months was -3.30 (95% CI -8.68 to 2.08), non-significantly less in the treated than the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>, in which 90 participants on placebo were compared with 89 on recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I 0.05 mg/kg/day and 87 participants on 0.1 mg/kg/day, the MD after nine months was -6.00 (95% CI -10.99 to -1.01) significantly less on treatment. The combined analysis from both RCTs showed a MD after nine months of -4.75 (95% CI -8.41 to -1.09), a significant difference in favour of the treated group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The AALSRS was not used in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in these results or in any of the other comparisons.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures showed similar trends favouring IGF-I at the 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 month assessments for the 0.1 mg/kg/day dose but these did not reach significance at the five per cent level. Similarly, the data with the 0.05 mg/kg/day dose (only evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>) showed trends favouring IGF-I at all time points but did not reach significance at the five per cent level at any point (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> ).</P>
<P>The only published SIP/QOL data are found in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>. After nine months there was significantly less decline in SIP on rhIGF-I than on placebo at the 0.5 mg/kg dose (MD -1.60, 95% CI -2.01 to -1.19) and at the 0.1 mg/kg dose (MD -3.90, 95% CI -4.26 to -3.54) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The only published survival data are found in the National Auxiliary Publications Service material and relate to <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Survival data for <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> were obtained from unpublished material available to the authors which has also been widely discussed at scientific meetings (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The only survival data during the randomised phase are at six months after randomisation and these did not provide any evidence that IGF-I influences survival as compared with placebo at this stage. Further survival data were available at 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. These data relate to observations obtained after completion of the randomised phase during open label treatment. It was possible that survival was increased in participants who had been treated with the 0.1 mg/kg/day dose during the randomised phase at 24 and 30 months post randomisation (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), but this was not supported when the 0.05 mg/kg/day (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) and 0.1 mg/kg/day doses were compared with placebo in a combined analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). Such a long-term effect on survival would be difficult to explain on a priori grounds and could only be explained on the hypothetical basis that treatment or non treatment with rhIGF-I during a critical phase early in the course of ALS had a major impact on long-term survival. Survival data in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK> is presented as a graph without supporting numerical data. In the absence of this an attempt was made to deduce the numerical data used to generate this figure using ruler measurements of an enlarged scan of the figure. These deduced numerical data are presented in additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> below.</P>
<P>Evaluation of adverse events showed only a marginally increased risk of injection site reactions/inflammation with IGF-I (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54) (see <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK> ). There was a suggestion of a relative excess number of deaths in <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>. This is of doubtful significance because a higher proportion of high-risk participants had been randomised to the IGF-1 group in this study. The drug otherwise seems safe and well-tolerated.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-15 09:19:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Results from four randomised trials (RCTs) of IGF-I in ALS were available. Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Only three fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>
<P>The authors considered the methodological quality of all three included trials unsatisfactory. Although the groups in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> were fairly well matched, the two groups in <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> were not so well balanced. The 2:1 randomisation in <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> resulted in too low a number of controls. The authors are concerned about the 'last observation carried forward' approach to impute missing data whereby participants were withdrawn from randomisation if they reached an AALSRS score of &gt; 115 or a FVC of &lt; 39% predicted. In the opinion of the review authors the protocols should have encouraged as many participants as possible to remain under placebo control for the entire nine month study period. In <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>, in addition to death (n = 26) and protocol specified terminations (n = 67), 32 participants withdrew for other reasons such as adverse experience, patient request and non-compliance. It should be further noted that in this study there were 99/330 (30%) participants that were not completers, well above the 20% required to have used death safely as an outcome measure by an intention-to-treat analysis and requiring safety checks with a completers analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK>, the equivalent figures were 23, 45 and 19 respectively. We were not able to obtain sufficient further data to evaluate the effect of these issues on the outcome of the studies. It is quite possible that participants with missing data were more seriously affected and that the omission of these data biased the trials towards results more favourable to a beneficial effect for IGF-I.</P>
<P>In retrospect the trial design carried a high risk of bias, principally through relying on a functional endpoint very sensitive to missing data. The way in which the missing values were treated in the trials, the lack of a straightforward comparative analysis of completers, and lack of transparency in the raw data preventing recalculations and comparisons between non- completers in the treated and placebo groups to see whether they had similar or different relevant features could well have biased the results in the intention-to-treat or the completers groups.</P>
<P>A further critical factor regarding the original two studies is that participants were withdrawn from the study after reaching predetermined endpoints with regard to the Appel scale and FVC. Thus the number of completers is low for this reason, and the nine month results are profoundly biased by the fact that potential non-responders were removed from the analyses. Less than 50% of participants remained in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK> at nine months. This poses additional statistical difficulties through removing participants at a failure endpoint and then basing the primary outcome on those that are not removed.</P>
<P>Any attempt to compare the outcome of <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK> with the other two was also seriously compromised by the use of a novel primary end point as well as a secondary end point which was not used in either of the other two trials.</P>
<P>Also, a slightly higher number of participants in the first two trials who received IGF-I experienced drug-related adverse effects, notably injection site inflammation. This could theoretically have had an adverse effect on blinding, such that participants could have come to be aware whether they were likely to be receiving placebo or IGF-I. It is for this reason that blinding in these trials was rated as unclear This did not seem to be so much of an issue in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>, taken alone, suggest that treatment with IGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day over a period of nine months is associated with slowing in the rate of progression of ALS, as judged by the AALSRS score, which is statistically significant at the one per cent level. Although the results of <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> (IGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day) did not achieve statistical significance at the five per cent level, the trend was towards a treatment effect. Similarly, although the results for the 0.05 mg/kg/day dose in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> did not achieve statistical significance, the trend was again towards a treatment effect. The review authors reiterate their concerns that missing data may have biased the trial towards results more favourable to a beneficial effect for IGF-I than is justified. The comparability of the trials is also limited by the subtle difference between the primary end points of the two trials and the AALSRS was not used as an end point in <LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>IGF-I seems to have been well tolerated and safe. A higher incidence of deaths in the IGF-I group in <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> was not statistically significant and was explained by an imbalance in randomisation with regards to age and FVC which are risk factors for death.</P>
<P>While the results of <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK> suggested slowing in decline of functional health status consistent with the data from the AALSRS, this is not supported by this review and could not be reproduced in <LINK REF="STD-Borasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borasio 1998</LINK> where, according to information from the company, problems with the translation of the instrument led to a high proportion of missing data.</P>
<P>Although survival was not a prime focus of study in any of the three included trials it is the only parameter common to all three for which any meaningful meta-analysis can be attempted. Even so, crude methods were needed to achieve this. Despite this, it seems clear that IGF-I, 0.1 mg/kg/day over a period of up to 24 months does not favourably influence survival in ALS.</P>
<P>There is thus no objective evidence of any efficacy of IGF-I in ALS on the basis of the trials done to date. There are issues regarding the design of all the completed trials. These issues include small sample size, short study duration, choice of AALSRS as the basis for the primary efficacy measure, choice of SIP as 'QOL' assessment, use of unconventional primary end points and failure to adequately consider more commonly considered end points such as death or time to ventilation. This review was also severely hampered by the inability of the reviewers to obtain AALSRS data without last-value-carried-forward (LVCF) adjusted means. The additional tables clearly show that several deaths occurred during the trial, but the change scores show that means are based on all randomised participants. Thus, LVCF must have been used in calculating the reported mean scores. This is particularly unfortunate since there were differences in the numbers of treated compared to placebo participants dropping out due to death. The effect of dropouts is to artificially inflate average scores at subsequent time points since the averages include up to 20% to 25% of scores from participants who died earlier (with less severe disease).</P>
<P>The evaluation of the potential efficacy of IGF-I in ALS has been seriously compromised by details of trial design in the studies completed to date. The authors are also concerned about details of the statistical analysis of the results, principally the approach to 'last observation carried forward'. However, there is no objective evidence of any efficacy of IGF-I as a disease modifying treatment for ALS on the basis of the trials done to date.</P>

<P>There is low quality evidence that rhIGF-I improves a composite outcome score and a subjective quality of life score at nine months only but this is of questionable significance. There is no evidence that survival in ALS is increased by IGFI.
