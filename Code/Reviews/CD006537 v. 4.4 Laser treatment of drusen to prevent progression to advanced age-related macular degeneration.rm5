<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of laser treatment of the centre of the retina in people with macular drusen to prevent the occurrence of the more advanced type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Drusen are yellowish deposits that can be seen in the macula (the centre of the retina) in a larger proportion of people as they get older. People with drusen, particularly extensive large drusen, are at higher risk of developing AMD. The most common complications in AMD are the growth of new blood vessels in the centre of the macula (called choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), also known as 'wet AMD') and loss of retinal cells or photoreceptors in the macula (called geographic atrophy). It has been observed clinically that making very small burns around the macula with laser light (laser photocoagulation) makes drusen disappear. Laser photocoagulation of drusen has thus been proposed as a way to prevent the development of CNV and geographic atrophy. More recently, subthreshold photocoagulation has been used to cause invisible laser burns and achieve drusen reduction with less damage to the retinal structure.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>The evidence is current to 3 August 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>This review included data from 11 trials conducted in Australia, Europe and North America. The studies followed up 2159 participants with drusen (3580 eyes) to two years, of which six studies (1454 participants) included people with one eye randomised to treatment and one to control. Four studies (850 eyes) used subthreshold photocoagulation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
<BR/>Three out of four studies using laser subthreshold photocoagulation were sponsored by the laser producer.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>These studies showed that laser photocoagulation of drusen leads to their disappearance. However, laser photocoagulation of drusen did not reduce the risk of developing CNV, which was about 10% at three years in untreated participants. A smaller number of studies reported on the development of geographic atrophy, that is, atrophy in the centre of the macula, but these studies were inconclusive and the effect of laser treatment of drusen on the development of geographic atrophy was uncertain. The risk of visual loss was similar in treated and untreated groups. There was no suggestion that a benefit may exist with subthreshold photocoagulation.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The overall quality of the evidence was high regarding failure to prevent CNV, but it was low for prevention of atrophy due to the small number of participants for whom this outcome was assessed.</P>

<P>Drusen are amorphous yellowish deposits beneath the sensory retina. People with drusen, particularly large drusen, are at higher risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-07 15:37:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of laser photocoagulation of drusen in AMD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-12 10:23:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY=" Iris Gordon">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2015), the ISRCTN registry (<A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch">www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-10 18:46:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa  Shah">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of laser treatment of drusen in AMD in which laser treatment had been compared with no intervention or sham treatment. Two types of trials were included. Some trials studied one eye of each participant (unilateral studies); other studies recruited participants with bilateral drusen and randomised one eye to photocoagulation or control and the fellow eye to the other group.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-10 18:47:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa  Shah">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We pooled data from unilateral and bilateral studies using a random-effects model. For the bilateral studies, we estimated the within-person correlation coefficient from one study and assumed it was valid for the others.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 13:20:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The update of this review found two additional studies, totaling 11 studies that randomised 2159 participants (3580 eyes) and followed them up to two years, of which six studies (1454 participants) included people with one eye randomised to treatment and one to control. Studies were conducted in Australia, Europe and North America.</P>
<P>Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low, particularly for the larger studies and for the primary outcome development of CNV. Photocoagulation did not reduce the development of CNV at two years' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.46, 11 studies, 2159 participants (3580 eyes), high quality evidence). This estimate means that, given an overall occurrence of CNV of 8.3% in the control group, we estimated an absolute risk reduction by no more than 1.4% in the laser group, according to the lower CI limit. Only two studies investigated the effect on the development of geographic atrophy and could not show a difference, but estimates were imprecise (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.51, two studies, 148 participants (148 eyes), low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Among secondary outcomes, photocoagulation led to drusen reduction (OR 9.16, 95% CI 6.28 to 13.4, three studies, 570 participants (944 eyes), high quality evidence) but was not shown to limit loss of 3 or more lines of visual acuity (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22, nine studies, 2002 participants (2386 eyes), moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>In a subgroup analysis, no difference could be shown for conventional visible (eight studies) versus subthreshold invisible (four studies) photocoagulation for the primary outcomes (P value = 0.29). The effect in the subthreshold group did not suggest a relevant benefit (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.98). No study used micropulse subthreshold photocoagulation.</P>
<P>No other adverse effects (apart from development of CNV, geographic atrophy or visual loss) were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-29 12:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The trials included in this review confirm the clinical observation that laser photocoagulation of drusen leads to their disappearance. However, treatment does not result in a reduction in the risk of developing CNV, and was not shown to limit the occurrence of geographic atrophy or visual acuity loss.</P>
<P>Ongoing studies are being conducted to assess whether the use of extremely short laser pulses (i.e. nanosecond laser treatment) cannot only lead to drusen regression but also prevent neovascular AMD.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-21 17:03:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vingerling-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vingerling 1996</LINK>). Early AMD is characterised by focal or diffuse depositing of extracellular material between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, forming drusen (focal deposits) or basal laminar deposits (diffuse deposits) (<LINK REF="REF-Bressler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bressler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarks-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarks 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1987</LINK>). This process is associated with progressive degeneration of PRE and photoreceptor cells (<LINK REF="REF-Guidry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guidry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phipps-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phipps 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1987</LINK>). Advanced AMD is characterised by the development of geographic atrophy (characterising the non-exudative AMD form) or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV; characterising the exudative AMD). When the fovea, which represents the centre of vision, is involved by atrophic or exudative manifestations of AMD, a severe visual loss results.</P>
<P>Advanced AMD has a prevalence that increases markedly with age (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2003</LINK>). In the US, advanced AMD prevalence is 3.5% in white men and 4% in white women at 75 to 79 years (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004</LINK>). Based on one systematic review of UK studies, <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2003</LINK> reported that there were approximately 214,000 people with visual impairment caused by AMD. In this study, the ratio of neovascular AMD to geographic atrophy was about 2 : 1, such as in <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>. Ten years later, <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2012</LINK> estimated 513.000 prevalent cases of late AMD, of which 263,000 were neovascular AMD. <LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2015</LINK> conducted a systematic review and estimated 293.000 incident cases of late AMD each year in the U.S.A.</P>
<P>Drusen results from deposition of the photoreceptors debris, which are composed of lipofuscin and membranous deposits. Drusen appear when sufficient material has been deposited, clinically characterised by amorphous yellowish deposits beneath the sensory retina. Four main types of drusen can be detected in the retina. Hard drusen are discrete, yellow, nodular deposits, smaller than 50 &#956;m in diameter. Basal laminar drusen are tiny, whitish, multiple deposits with a 'starry night' appearance. Soft drusen are yellowish deposits with poorly defined margins, tending to coalesce, and are usually larger than 50 &#956;m. Crystalline drusen are discrete, calcific, refractile deposits. Drusen characteristics associated with a high risk of progression to exudative AMD (high-risk drusen) include: soft drusen, more than five, larger size (greater than 63 &#956;m), drusen confluence and associated hyperpigmentation.</P>
<P>The cumulative incidence of new exudative or atrophic lesions in eyes initially free of advanced AMD has been estimated as 8.6% at one year, 16.4% at two years and 23.5% at three years (<LINK REF="REF-Holz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holz 1994</LINK>). Focusing on the CNV incidence, the results of a prospective investigation of people with exudative manifestation in one eye and drusen in the fellow eye has shown that the risk of developing CNV peaks at four years, dissipating thereafter, whereas there is a slightly increased incidence of geographic atrophy in the longer term (<LINK REF="REF-Sarraf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarraf 1999</LINK>). Moreover, the five-year risk of CNV occurrence in the fellow eye of people who have already experienced CNV in the first eye, varies from 7% to 87% depending on the co-existence of four main risk factors (presence of five or more drusen, focal hyperpigmentation, one or more large drusen and systemic hypertension) (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Drusen can spontaneously disappear in people with AMD, generally leaving atrophic lesions. More specifically, the Waterman study has reported that disappearance of large drusen occurred in 16/47 (34%) participants in one five-year longitudinal study (<LINK REF="REF-Bressler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bressler 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 10:33:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Laser treatment is based on the release of a powerful beam of light that, combined with ophthalmic equipment and lenses, can be precisely focused on the retina to treat some diseases. The laser energy causes a certain amount of controlled damage to the tissues in order to obtain the desired effect. Small laser burns are usually employed to obliterate or destroy abnormal blood vessels or other lesions in the eye.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Several observers noted that laser application can lead to drusen being resorbed in the macular area (<LINK REF="REF-Cleasby-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleasby 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gass-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gass 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross_x002d_Jendroska-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross-Jendroska 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetzig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetzig 1994</LINK>). Owing to the risk of vision loss associated with the presence of high-risk drusen, laser application was proposed as an intervention to prevent progression to advanced AMD. Laser burns are applied to the retina, either directly to the drusen or following pre-defined patterns. Argon, krypton, dye or diode lasers have been used with varying levels of energy (achieving from not visible to faint or intense whitish retinal lesions). The spot size used varies between 100 and 200 &#956;m and number of spots from less than 10 to nearly 300.</P>
<P>Subthreshold laser therapy is a more recent application of laser energy to retinal diseases. The theoretical advantage of subthreshold laser is based on minimising the damage to the retinal tissue by ensuring the energy spreads as little as possible. This aim can be achieved by reducing the duration of laser exposure and operates with a sub-visible clinical endpoint. As a result, no laser scar is produced in the retina, obtaining at the same time equivalent clinical effects of conventional laser treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sivaprasad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivaprasad 2010</LINK>). Several studies have shown that subthreshold laser photocoagulation can be a viable option for several disorders, including diabetic macular oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Lavinsky-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavinsky 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luttrull-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luttrull 2012</LINK>), macular oedema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Parodi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parodi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parodi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parodi 2008</LINK>), and macular drusen. Subthreshold photocoagulation encompasses a range of techniques, among which micropulse subthreshold photocoagulation delivers light energy with very short impulses that are absorbed by the RPE only, aiming to spare the neurosensory retina.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-21 17:03:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The mechanisms of laser-induced drusen regression are only speculative. Laser treatment may lead to an increased clearance of debris by choroidal phagocytic cells or macrophages. Alternatively, laser application may improve egress of drusen material through a thinner or more permeable Bruch's membrane, with the consequent reduction of its outflow resistance. Laser effect may manifest by triggering retinal pigment epithelial proliferation leading to the production and release of cytokines and growth factors. These molecules may be able to modify the biochemical process underlying the clinical manifestations of the retinal disorder, rather than simply destroying drusen, and may also act on the drusen remote from the site of the laser energy application (<LINK REF="REF-Abdelsalam-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdelsalam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frennesson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frennesson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauleikhoff-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauleikhoff 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauleikhoff-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauleikhoff 1990b</LINK>). Histopathological examinations in animal models have shown that phagocytic cells, probably derived from choriocapillaris pericytes, can remove drusenoid material after laser photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Duvall-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duvall 1985</LINK>). Protrusion of choroidal endothelial cell processes into Bruch's membrane are enhanced by laser photocoagulation and may play a part in the clearance of debris from the Bruch's membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Guymer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guymer 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Micropulse laser delivery tries to achieve photostimulation rather than photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Luttrull-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luttrull 2012</LINK>). However, the mechanism of photocoagulation itself is poorly known, as reported above, thus we also include micropulse photocoagulation in this review. Picosecond laser treatment has been attempted to achieve drusen reduction and prevent CNV, a treatment that was defined "retinal rejuvenation therapy (2RT)" (<LINK REF="STD-Guymer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guymer 2014</LINK>). Using very short laser pulses (3 ns), an insult caused by steam production around melanosomes can be confined to the RPE inducing a highly selective and discrete non-thermal injury. It has been hypothesised that a 3-ns laser could induce migration of RPE cells and release of matrix metalloproteinases, improving the hydraulic conductivity of Bruch's membrane. The hope is to achieve a prophylactic treatment of early AMD without the potential harmful effects seen with traditional thermal lasers.</P>

<P>AMD is a major public health problem in developed economies where the life expectancy is greatest (but of no significance in poorer countries with a life expectancy of under 65 years of age). Several investigations about health-related and vision-targeted features have shown that AMD is associated with decreased quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chakravarthy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakravarthy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maguire-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangione-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although people with drusen experience few visual symptoms, once advanced AMD is present, visual loss is generally irreversible. It has been shown that people with drusen who take antioxidant supplementation are less likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity over the follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>), even though this benefit was considered modest in people with moderate to severe signs of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2012</LINK>). Antioxidants have not been shown beneficial in the primary prevention of AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2007</LINK>). Thus, the identification of a prophylactic treatment able to reduce the complications related to AMD may be highly beneficial.</P>
<P>Laser treatment of drusen appeared to provide positive results in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cleasby-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleasby 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gass-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gass 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross_x002d_Jendroska-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross-Jendroska 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sigelman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sigelman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetzig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetzig 1994</LINK>). A systematic review is necessary to ensure that all the evidence on this intervention is considered objectively. People with AMD and their carers need to have recommendations as to the possible benefits or harms of this intervention.</P>

<P>Visual acuity is generally measured using a standard chart, the ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart and scored in letters. There are five letters per line in this chart. We extracted both dichotomous outcomes, such as moderate (3 lines or 15 ETDRS letters) and severe (6 lines or 30 ETDRS letters) visual loss and continuous measures (mean visual acuity) when possible. Whenever no ETDRS values were used, we converted visual acuity to LogMAR for pooling data.</P>
<P>Contrast sensitivity is generally measured with the Pelli-Robson chart. Scores are collected in letters or as logarithm of contrast sensitivity. We used the logarithm of contrast sensitivity for pooling data when feasible. We extracted both continuous and dichotomous measures if possible. For dichotomous data, we recorded the proportion of participants with a change of at least 0.3 (corresponding to a two-fold change) or 0.6 log-units (corresponding to a four-fold change).</P>
<P>In the protocol, we planned to evaluate drusen reduction considering the number of eyes showing at least a 50% reduction of drusen area from the baseline aspect. However, data were sparsely reported and, therefore, we modified the protocol to allow an extraction based on the investigators' definition.</P>
<P>We converted reading ability measures to LogMAR for reading acuity, whereas we considered reading speed as the logarithm of the number of words read in one minute.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:34:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included trials for bias according to the methods described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). With the update of review management software, we assessed risk of bias using the tool set out in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation: the method used to generate the allocation sequence, to assess whether it should have produced comparable groups.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: the method used to conceal the allocation sequence, to determine whether intervention allocations could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.      </LI>
<LI>Masking of personnel and outcome assessors: the assessments were made for each main class of outcomes (i.e. anatomic versus functional outcomes) and we considered whether all measures used, if any, to mask study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received were adequate.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data: the assessments were made for each main class of outcomes (i.e. anatomic versus functional outcomes) when possible and were based on the description of the completeness of outcome data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis and their causes, if they were reported.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: the possibility of selective outcome reporting, such as found when some measures were obtained, as declared in the methods section or in protocols, but not reported in the results section.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used the following grading:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias: plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias: plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias: plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results.</LI>

<P>If the information available in the published trial reports was inadequate to assess any of the above items of the risk of bias assessment, we contacted the trial authors for clarification. If they did not respond within a reasonable period, we classified the trial based on the available information. When studies did not report any concealment approach, we considered adequacy unclear. We also assessed the impact of any assumptions made in this regard in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>We considered a trial to have conducted an intention-to-treat analysis only if it included all participants who were randomised including those randomised but not treated and excluded after randomisation for other reasons.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-09-29 14:27:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We evaluated development of CNV and geographic atrophy on the basis of the percentage of their occurrence over the follow-up. We assessed visual acuity loss taking into consideration the loss of 3 or more lines of visual acuity, which corresponds to a doubling of the visual angle if visual acuity is measured using a logMAR chart.</P>
<P>We planned to evaluate drusen reduction considering the number of eyes showing at least a 50% reduction of drusen area from the baseline aspect. However, data were sparsely reported and, therefore, we modified the protocol to allow an extraction based on the investigators' definition.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>Dichotomous data included, for example, progression of CNV or geographic atrophy, or loss of 3 or more lines of visual acuity. In the protocol, we stated that we would have used the risk ratio (RR) as our preferred measure of effect since we anticipated that the event rate would be greater than 10%. We actually found that the event rate was lower than this threshold in bilateral studies. Furthermore, to be able to manage data from unilateral and bilateral studies, we had to manipulate them using formulas proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>, which only apply to odds ratios (OR). Little difference is expected between RRs and ORs in this review, since the crude event rate was less than 10% in bilateral studies and less than 25% in unilateral studies, and also because the pooled OR was close to 1.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data included, for example, reading speed. We used the mean difference (MD), unless the outcomes were measured on different scales in which case we used the standardised mean difference as the measure of effect.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-09-29 14:30:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Some trials identified a 'study eye' and randomised participants to treatment group. Other trials randomised the eye to treatment and compared it with the other eye in the same person. We were careful to consider these trials separately at the data collection and extraction stage.</P>
<P>We did two sets of analyses for the primary outcome 'development of CNV'. First, we pooled all the data ignoring the fact that the data from the bilateral studies were not independent. Second, we then did a sensitivity analysis assuming an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.5 for the development of CNV and 0.22 for visual acuity loss. We adjusted the standard errors using the methods given in Chapter 16 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>. See <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> for more details on the method used.</P>
<P>We used the generic inverse variance facility in Review Manager 5 to enter the data for the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:42:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In the event that data were missing, we contacted the authors of the studies in an attempt to obtain more information. On the basis of the data we could collect, we first did an available case analysis. We recorded the amount of missing data in the included studies as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. At the time the protocol for this review was prepared, we planned that if missing data should prove to be a problem in the constituent studies, we would consider doing a sensitivity analysis considering outcome in the people lost to follow-up as either 'all OK' or 'all not OK' to see the range within which the true result might lie. This did not prove necessary at this stage. According to further guidance available in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>), missing outcome data are not a problem if loss to follow-up is both balanced in the study arms of parallel arm studies and causes of loss are documented and judged to be unrelated to outcome in both study arms. When these conditions are not satisfied, a study can still be at low risk of bias if the outcome frequency is about 50% and loss to follow-up is below 10% in both arms (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because our primary outcomes were relatively rare in the complete case analysis in this review, and there were missing data of unreported cause, there was potential for bias due to incomplete outcome data in this review. In the updated version of this review, we considered missing data as at no risk of bias in bilateral studies because a participant with paired treatment and control eyes is missed. For each unilateral study, we assessed the risk of bias using methods described in <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>, based on the users' written function 'metamiss' in Stata 13.1 (<LINK REF="REF-StataCorp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">StataCorp 2013</LINK>) to conduct sensitivity analyses on primary outcome meta-analysis results by making different assumptions on informative missingness odds ratios (IMORs) across studies according to <LINK REF="REF-White-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>Finally, in the updated version of this review, we used the user written command <I>extfunnel</I> in Stata to assess the impact of a new study on the meta-analysis according to <LINK REF="REF-Langan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langan 2012</LINK>.</P>

<P>We stated in the protocol that we aimed to obtain data at two years. However, we used three-year data for three studies that reported the outcome with more detail at this time point (<LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frennesson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frennesson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PTAMD-bilateral-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PTAMD bilateral 2009</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-PTAMD-bilateral-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PTAMD bilateral 2009</LINK>, the number of events were calculated applying the percentage estimated from Kaplan-Mayer survival curves to complete cases; <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Frennesson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frennesson 2009</LINK> used the last visit at a mean of 3.2 years (<LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995)</LINK> and 3.7 years (<LINK REF="STD-Frennesson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frennesson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Olk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olk 1999</LINK> did not report crude data at two years, but presented survival curves, from which we extracted graphically the proportion of people with CNV and atrophy at two years using the number of eyes followed up in each group to compute standard errors. Most bilateral studies provided marginal data only (i.e. a frequency tabulation that ignores the paired nature of data), but we could extract and use a correlation coefficient from <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK> as shown in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>Among bilateral studies, we could extract paired data on development of CNV from <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK>, but we considered that this study was too small to estimate the correlation coefficient reliably. <LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> provided marginal data, but the P value was obtained from a Cox proportional hazards model, not from a McNemar Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test; thus, we did not use the method shown in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was poor reporting of the primary outcome 'development of geographic atrophy'. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Laser-to-Drusen-Study-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laser to Drusen Study 1995</LINK> were obtained from the authors. Data from survival curves could be estimated from the unilateral arm of <LINK REF="STD-CNVPT" TYPE="STUDY">CNVPT</LINK>; cross-tabulations were constructed using the number of complete cases who did not develop CNV because, in the absence of a clear reporting of the total number of eyes at each step of the survival curve, we considered that eyes with a neovascular lesion may have complex fundus changes preventing a precise assessment of geographic atrophy.</P>

Most studies provided marginal data, but we could extract a correlation coefficient from <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK> and use it as shown in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> to obtain correct standard errors. <LINK REF="STD-Frennesson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frennesson 2009</LINK> only reported mean visual acuity and dichotomous data on visual loss could not be obtained.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-CNVPT" TYPE="STUDY">CNVPT</LINK> presented contrast sensitivity and reading ability data.</P>
<P>Most studies analysed drusen reduction. It was possible to extract data on this outcome from two unilateral studies and one bilateral study. For <LINK REF="STD-CNVPT" TYPE="STUDY">CNVPT</LINK>, we extracted data graphically from a survival curve using the number of eyes followed up in each group to generate a cross-tabulation of the eyes with a 50% or more drusen area reduction among treated and control eyes. Two studies gave the approximate percentages with apparent drusen reduction: <LINK REF="STD-PTAMD-unilateral-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PTAMD unilateral 2002</LINK> at 18 months and <LINK REF="STD-PTAMD-bilateral-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PTAMD bilateral 2009</LINK> at two years. We used the number of participants still followed minus those who developed CNV as the total number in each group for generating the 2 x 2 table. We could not extract data on drusen reduction from the other studies. In fact, <LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK> were bilateral studies but reported marginal data only. <LINK REF="STD-Olk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olk 1999</LINK> provided pooled data only for unilateral and bilateral cases. <LINK REF="STD-Frennesson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frennesson 1995</LINK> provided means and standard deviations but used Snellen values to compute them, which is incorrect, and data had a very skewed distribution.

<P>Participants were not masked (blinded) since a sham procedure was never adopted. We acknowledge that it is not possible to mask outcome assessors to anatomic outcomes because laser scars are visible around the macula, unless subthreshold photocoagulation is used and effective. However, masking of functional outcome assessors can be achieved in theory, but was rarely so, or reported as such, in these studies. We think that development of CNV is a sufficiently objective diagnosis to be classified as having low risk of bias despite lack of masking of outcome assessors. On the contrary, vision outcomes such as visual acuity and contrast sensitivity can easily be measured by a masked assessor, and lack of masking can introduce bias because the procedure is operator dependent.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> also reported on contrast sensitivity, but this was a paired study and the data could not be analysed since an estimate of the correlation coefficient was not obtained.

Several authors have recorded that in their experience the use of laser can result in reabsorption of macular drusen (<LINK REF="REF-Cleasby-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleasby 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Figueroa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figueroa 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gass-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gass 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetzig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetzig 1994</LINK>). As yet, it is unclear whether drusen reduction can lead to clinical benefits, including improvement or stabilisation of visual acuity, delayed or reduced CNV, or harms such as the onset of atrophy.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In the update of this review, we identified two new trials, leading the total number to 11 studies, in which 2159 participants (3580 eyes) were randomised to laser treatment of drusen or observation and followed up to at least two years. These trials confirmed the clinical observation that laser photocoagulation of drusen was able to cause their disappearance. However, there was no evidence that this loss of drusen resulted in any benefit in terms of the development of CNV or geographic atrophy or prevention of visual acuity loss. The results of the present review indicated that the prophylactic laser treatment of drusen is ineffective as a means for delaying the progression of AMD and preventing visual loss. A clinically relevant benefit can be excluded for people at medium risk of CNV, which was about 9% within two years in our primary meta-analysis, based on the primary outcomes. Among the secondary outcomes, the CI of the visual loss outcome also tended to exclude important harms.</P>
<P>The two new studies used near-infrared subthreshold photocoagulation, totalling four studies with 539 eyes of different people treated with this technique. The meta-analytic OR and its 95% CI also did not suggest potential for benefit. However, no study included in this review used micropulse subthreshold photocoagulation, since photocoagulation was used with low power but continuous laser light delivery.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:40:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Some of these trials adopted a paired study design (six studies, 1454 participants), which rendered the analysis of the data difficult. Moreover, only a few studies reported data on secondary outcomes, especially contrast sensitivity and reading ability. Despite these limitations, the studies included in this review were conducted in different countries and follow-up length was enough to be able to record long-term effects of this intervention.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:41:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Overall, we judged the evidence included for the primary outcome 'development of CNV' represent high quality of evidence (i.e. that we are reasonably certain that the estimate of effect represents the true value). We downgraded the judgement of quality to low for the other primary outcome 'development of geographic atrophy' because there were only two studies with few participants and, therefore, the effect estimates were very imprecise.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:41:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>One source of bias in this review may be the pooling of unilateral and bilateral studies based on assumptions about the statistical correlation of within-person data. To try to counteract this potential shortcoming, we not only used the information available from some studies, suggesting very low correlation for the primary outcome 'occurrence of CNV', but also used a mean correlation as a sensitivity analysis, which did not change the conclusions of our review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:43:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Even though drusen area reduction can be achieved through laser treatment, this review suggests that this intervention is not associated with improved outcomes for the patients, based on meta-analyses of studies, which, overall, had a low risk of bias.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-29 20:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The results of this review suggest there is no need to conduct more research on photocoagulation directed to drusen in people with AMD, in accordance with the fact that no further trials were published after 2009. We acknowledge that the evidence on different lasers sources and strategies, such as the subthreshold one, is more limited, yet our findings do not seem to differ for this subtype of laser photocoagulation, if it is obtained with low-power continuous laser light, such as in the included studies, which did not use micropulse photocoagulation.</P>
<P>A study is ongoing to investigate the effect of nanosecond laser treatment to drusen.</P>

<P>The protocol was originally published in 2007 and since that time there have been considerable developments in Cochrane methodology including assessment of risk of bias and preparation of 'Summary of findings' tables and grading of the overall quality of evidence using GRADE. We have incorporated these developments in the review.</P>
<P>We have also made the following specific changes from the protocol.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the protocol, drusen reduction was planned to be evaluated considering the number of eyes showing at least a 50% reduction of drusen area from the baseline aspect. However, data were sparsely reported and, therefore, we modified the protocol to allow an extraction based on the investigators' definition.</LI>
<LI>In the protocol, we planned to use the risk ratio as the main effect measure but we used the odds ratio because this made it easier to adjust for within-person correlation. See section '<LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect'</LINK>.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>In the 2015 update, we decided that the risk of bias due to missing data was low in bilateral trials, since a pair of treatment and control eyes would be lost, which would be unlikely to alter the odd ratio significantly. Thus, we simplified the sensitivity analysis of missing data as described in <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>.</LI>

<P>Method of allocation: treatment assignments were generated using a randomly permuted block method, stratified by clinical centre and using a randomly chosen block size. A member of the <LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> Co-ordinating Centre reviewed an eligibility checklist with the local ophthalmologist and clinic co-ordinator during a teleconference before disclosing which of the 2 eyes was assigned to laser treatment</P>
<P>Masking: masked VA examiners. Unclear if participants and care providers were masked. Not reported if anatomic outcomes assessors were masked (i.e. Photograph Reading Centre), but masking was unlikely to be achieved since photocoagulation generates visible scars</P>
<P>Exclusions after randomisation: none reported</P>
<P>Losses to follow-up: during 5 years of follow-up, 5891 (97.2%) visits were completed of the 6061 6-month and annual visits scheduled for surviving <LINK REF="STD-CAPT" TYPE="STUDY">CAPT</LINK> participants. This percentage was relatively stable over time</P>

<P>Treatment: low-intensity laser treatment. 3 different laser treatment protocols: 1. Laser 20: 20 laser burns, 100 &#956;m in diameter, in a pattern of 3 rows placed between the 12 and 6 o'clock positions beyond the temporal perimeter of the FAZ. The desired intensity of the burns was a grey-white lesion. Direct application of laser burns to drusen to be avoided. Whenever the area of drusen had not been reduced by &#8805; 50% at 6 months of enrolment, a second treatment was applied nasal to the fovea in a mirror image of the first treatment. During the last 6 months of enrolment, a second laser treatment protocol was adopted that specified 24 laser burns, 100 &#956;m in diameter in a circular pattern of 2 rows surrounding the macular drusen</P>

<P>Eyes were treated with a slit-lamp integrated diode photocoagulator using 810-nm wavelength (IRIS Medical OcuLight SLx; IRIDEX Corp., Mt. View, CA). 48 diode laser lesions of 125 mm were applied in 4 concentric circles outside the FAZ in a scatter or grid pattern between 750 and 2250 mm from the centre of the fovea. Test spot laser lesions were applied to the retina nasal to the optic nerve using 200-millisecond duration, and the power was increased to produce a mild grey lesion (visible burn). For eyes assigned to visible treatment, this intensity was then applied in a grid pattern as described above. For eyes assigned to subthreshold treatment, the energy needed for the visible test burn was kept constant, but the duration was halved to 100 milliseconds and treatment then carried out.

<P>Eyes randomised to treatment received a single-session treatment of a grid of 48 diode laser lesions of 125 &#956;m in diameter. Laser treatment was applied in an annular grid that extended from 0.5 (750 &#956;m) to 2.0 (3000 &#956;m) disc diameters from the centre of the FAZ. A slit lamp-based diode laser photocoagulation system (IRIS Medical, Mountain View, CA) emitting energy at 810 nm was used to deliver the laser treatment. Laser lesions were placed in a subthreshold manner by first delivering test spot(s) of 200-millisecond duration placed outside of the macula at a low power (e.g. 200 mW) and then incrementally increasing the power in small (50 mW) increments until a faint grey (threshold) lesion could be detected visually through the treatment lens. While the power setting was left unchanged, the pulse duration was reduced to a 100-millisecond interval to achieve an invisible subthreshold lesion. Laser lesions were then scattered within the annular grid as defined above, beginning by placing 12 spots in a given quadrant and then proceeding to adjacent quadrants to complete the treatment pattern. The drusen were not targeted specifically or preferentially. If a visible lesion was produced while the annular grid treatment was performed, the power setting was reduced to achieve subthreshold lesions with the remainder</P>

<LI>Any black (hypofluorescent) area of FAF consistent with GA (roughly round or oval shape, sharp margins), and corroborated on colour photography as a patch of hypopigmentation</LI>
<LI>Any evidence of 'preclinical atrophy' as determined on OCT: loss of the outer retina (RPE and photoreceptors on the cube scan (Spectralis OCT) (49 horizontal B scans, 120 µm apart over a 20 x 20 degree scan). This covers approximately 6 x 6 mm in an emmetropic eye (note: peri-papillary atrophy further than 1500 &#956;m from the fovea is allowed)</LI>

Amblyopia in either eye even if BCVA is better than 6/12 (20/40)</LI>
<LI>Known allergic hypersensitivity to fluorescein</LI>
<LI>Previous retinal or other ocular surgical procedures, the effects of which may now or in the future complicate assessment of the progression of AMD</LI>
<LI>Requirement for any systemic or ocular medication known to be toxic to the retina, such as: deferoxamine, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (Plaquinil), chlorpromazine, phenothiazines and ethambutol</LI>

<P>The assessment of the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data is based on the graphical presentation in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> based on the methods described in <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>. In the updated version of this review, we considered missing data as at no risk of bias in bilateral studies because a participant with paired treatment and control eyes is missed.</P>
<P>F: failures (choroidal neovascularisation development), S: successes, D: deaths, M: missing of unknown cause, NA: not available.</P>
<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Only last visit follow-up available and no information on when choroidal neovascularisation developed in cases with event.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Deaths were not reported and all missing data were coded as missing of unknown cause.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Deaths were provided overall (n = 11 at 2 years) and were equally split between assignment groups. Data at 1 or 3 years were available and midpoints were used.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2015-09-30 09:59:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">Estimate of the correlation coefficient of the measurements within participants in bilateral studies</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-20 21:03:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK> provided a method for conducting meta-analyses of studies using paired data, such as cross-over studies or studies on paired organs. In this appendix, we showed how we adjusted the marginal measurements, that is, with eyes as the unit of analysis extracted from bilateral studies by the intraindividual correlation coefficient extracted from other studies in order to obtain correct standard errors of the odds ratio.</P>
<P>We found both marginal and paired analyses in <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK>. Data were limited to the primary outcome 'development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV)' and to the secondary outcome 'loss of visual acuity'. In particular, Table 4 in <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK> presented marginal data on CNV occurrence, our primary outcome, and visual loss while displaying P values obtained with the McNemar test, which is based on the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> distribution and is adequate for paired data. In particular, 12/103 laser-treated eyes and 7/103 fellow eyes developed CNV and the McNemar P value was 0.2253. The marginal P value using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test would have been 0.2286. We considered that the ratio of the z-values corresponding to these paired and marginal P values (1.2039 (paired) and 1.1907 (marginal)) could be used to adjust the standard errors of the marginal logOR of CNV occurrence for laser-treated eyes compared to controls. The inverse ratio of these two z-values was 0.9782, implying that no adjustment of the marginal logOR standard error was needed for the <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK> data. Because the marginal logOR variance was 0.4976, its value adjusted for the correlation between eyes was 0.4867, the difference between the two being twice the covariance (which was 0.0054). From these data, the correlation coefficient could be calculated to be only 0.0451 (i.e. 0.0054*square root(12*7*96*91)/103, using the method shown in <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). An issue concerning this correlation coefficient imputation is whether the coverage achieved by the McNemar test is acceptable given the possibility of cells with counts close to nil in paired 2 x 2 tables from medium size studies such as this when events are not common.</P>
<P>Given the negligible effect of the correlation between eyes of the same participant for the CNV development outcome in <LINK REF="STD-DLS" TYPE="STUDY">DLS</LINK>, we used marginal data from bilateral studies as if eyes were independent units.</P>
<P>Using the same method for visual acuity loss, the ratio of the marginal and paired logOR standard errors was 0.8143, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.2290. Therefore, for this outcome, we decided to use the inverse variance method and adjust the marginal logOR standard error by 1.2280 (the reciprocal of the previous ratio).</P>
<P>We obtained a different estimate of the correlation between eyes for the CNV outcome from <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK>. Using the formulas provided by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>, the correlation coefficient was 0.69 in this small data-set using the last follow-up examination to assess the risk of CNV occurrence. Using <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK> notations, the numbers to calculate this value would be: s = 23, t = 2, u = 0, v = 2, hence a = 25, b = 23, c = 2, d = 4. However, this was a very small study and was expected to estimate correlation imprecisely and also to be affected by approximations due to low cell counts, for which common formulas for 2 x 2 tables do not hold. Thus, we did not use this type of estimate of the correlation coefficient.</P>
<P>Finally, we decided to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the outcome 'development of CNV' using a moderate correlation between eyes of 0.5 to correct standard errors of the marginal odds ratio.</P>

<P>We used the following approaches to take into account the impact of missing data. In the updated version of this review, we considered missing data as at no risk of bias in bilateral studies because a participant with paired treatment and control eyes is missed. Thus, we only considered losses in unilateral studies.</P>
<P>We used Stata 13.1 software (<LINK REF="REF-StataCorp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">StataCorp 2013</LINK>) users' written function '<I>metamiss'</I> assuming random uncorrelated opposite informative missingness odds ratios (IMORs) for treatment and controls (1/2 and 2; 2 and 1/2). We assumed additional uncertainty about log(IMOR) by setting its prior standard deviation at 1, which will result in larger 95% confidence intervals and, finally, in less weight on studies with numerous missing data. Finally, we assumed uncorrelated IMORs of treatment and control groups when setting the '<I>metamiss'</I> command. <LINK REF="REF-White-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2008</LINK> provides the underlying theory and a link to download '<I>metamiss'</I>.</P>
<P>The results of these sensitivity meta-analyses on the primary analysis occurrence of CNV are shown and discussed in unilateral studies.</P>
