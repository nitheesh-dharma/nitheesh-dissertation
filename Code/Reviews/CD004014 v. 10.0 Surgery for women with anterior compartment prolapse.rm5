<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To determine the safety and effectiveness of surgery for anterior vaginal wall prolapse.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in up to 50% of women who have given birth. This can happen at different sites within the vagina; prolapse of the anterior compartment is most difficult to repair, and rates of recurrence are higher than at other vaginal sites. This challenge has resulted in the use of a variety of surgical techniques and grafts to improve outcomes of anterior compartment prolapse surgery. We aimed to evaluate surgical interventions for anterior compartment prolapse.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors included in this review 33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 3332 surgeries to compare traditional native tissue anterior repair versus biological grafts (eight trials), absorbable mesh (three trials), permanent (polypropylene) mesh (16 trials) and abdominal paravaginal repair (two trials). Four trials compared a transvaginal graft versus another transvaginal graft, and four trials evaluated native tissue repair of anterior and/or posterior compartments of the vagina versus graft repair. Evidence is current to 23 August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Biological graft repair or absorbable mesh provides minimal advantage compared with native tissue repair. Results showed no evidence of differences between biological graft and native tissue repair in rates of awareness of prolapse or repeat surgery for prolapse. However, the recurrent anterior prolapse rate was higher after native tissue repair than after any biological graft. This suggests that if awareness of prolapse after biological graft occurs in 12% of women, 7% to 23% would be aware of prolapse after native tissue repair.</P>
<P>Permanent mesh resulted in lower rates of awareness of prolapse, recurrent anterior wall prolapse and repeat surgery for prolapse compared with native tissue repair. However, native tissue repair was associated with reduced risk of new stress urinary incontinence. Other benefits of native tissue repair included reduced bladder injury and reduced rates of repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and mesh exposure (as a combined outcome).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the data related to traditional native tissue anterior repair compared with both biological grafts and permanent mesh is generally low to moderate. The main limitations were incomplete reporting of study methods including allocation concealment and bias and imprecision in data outcomes. Data related to the efficacy of absorbable mesh are probably incomplete.<BR/>

<P>Biological graft repair or absorbable mesh provides minimal advantage compared with native tissue repair.</P>
<P>Native tissue repair was associated with increased awareness of prolapse and increased risk of repeat surgery for prolapse and recurrence of anterior compartment prolapse compared with polypropylene mesh repair. However, native tissue repair was associated with reduced risk of de novo SUI, reduced bladder injury, and reduced rates of repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and mesh exposure (composite outcome).</P>
<P>Current evidence does not support the use of mesh repair compared with native tissue repair for anterior compartment prolapse owing to increased morbidity.</P>
<P>Many transvaginal polypropylene meshes have been voluntarily removed from the market, and newer light-weight transvaginal meshes that are available have not been assessed by RCTs. Clinicans and women should be cautious when utilising these products, as their safety and efficacy have not been established.</P>

<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is common and is seen on examination in 40% to 60% of parous women (<LINK REF="REF-Handa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrix 2002</LINK>). The annual aggregated rate of associated surgery in the United States is in the range of 10 to 30 per 10,000 women (<LINK REF="REF-Brubaker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brubaker 2002</LINK>). The anterior compartment of the vagina is the vaginal site most commonly affected by prolapse and is the most difficult to repair.</P>
<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the pelvic organs (uterus, vagina, bladder or bowel). Different types of prolapse include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>upper vaginal prolapse (i.e. uterus, vaginal vault (after hysterectomy when the top of the vagina drops down));</LI>
<LI>anterior vaginal wall prolapse (i.e. cystocele (bladder descends), urethrocele (urethra descends), paravaginal defect (pelvic fascia defect)); and</LI>
<LI>posterior vaginal wall prolapse (i.e. enterocele (small bowel descends), rectocele (rectum descends), perineal deficiency).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A woman can present with prolapse of one or more of these sites.</P>
<P>The aetiology of pelvic organ prolapse is complex and multi-factorial. Possible risk factors include pregnancy, childbirth, congenital or acquired connective tissue abnormalities, denervation or weakness of the pelvic floor, ageing, hysterectomy, menopause and factors associated with chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women with anterior compartment prolapse commonly have a variety of pelvic floor symptoms, only some of which are directly related to the prolapse. Generalised symptoms of prolapse include pelvic heaviness; a bulge, lump or protrusion coming down from the vagina; a dragging sensation in the vagina; and backache. Symptoms of bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction are frequently present. For example, women may need to reduce the prolapse by using their fingers to push the prolapse up to aid urinary voiding or defecation. These symptoms may be directly related to the prolapsed organ, for example, poor urinary stream when a cystocele is present or obstructed defecation when a rectocele is present. Symptoms may also be independent of the prolapse, for example, symptoms of overactive bladder (urinary urgency) or urinary stress incontinence when a cystocele is present.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-14 02:12:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of a woman with prolapse depends on the severity of the prolapse, its symptoms, the woman's general health and surgeon preference and capabilities. Options for treatment include conservative, mechanical and surgical interventions.</P>
<P>Generally, conservative or mechanical treatments are considered for women with a mild degree of prolapse, those who wish to have more children, frail women and those unwilling to undergo surgery. Conservative and mechanical interventions have been considered in separate Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2011</LINK>). No good evidence was available to guide management in either of these reviews.</P>
<P>A wide variety of abdominal and vaginal surgical techniques are available for the treatment of patients with prolapse (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The most common and traditional procedure is the anterior repair (colporrhaphy) for anterior vaginal wall prolapse, which is frequently performed in conjunction with other interventions for prolapse and/or urinary stress incontinence. Together, anterior and posterior compartment surgeries account for more than 90% of all prolapse operations (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1997</LINK>). Two main approaches can be used.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Vaginal approaches include vaginal hysterectomy, anterior or posterior vaginal wall repair (colporrhaphy), McCall culdoplasty, Manchester repair (amputation of the cervix with uterus suspension to the cardinal ligaments), prespinous and sacrospinous colpopexy, enterocele ligation, paravaginal repair, Le Fortes procedure and perineal reconstruction.</LI>
<LI>Abdominal approaches include hysterectomy, sacral colpopexy, paravaginal repair, vault suspending and uterosacral ligament plication, enterocele ligation and posterior vaginal wall repair. Abdominal surgery can be performed through an open incision or keyhole incisions via the laparoscope or robot.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The current review considers all surgical procedures for women with anterior compartment pelvic organ prolapse.</P>
<P>A combination of some of the above-mentioned procedures may be employed concomitantly at the time of anterior compartment prolapse surgery. In addition to the variety of prolapse operations that can be performed, the surgeon must choose whether to use absorbable sutures such as polyglycolic acid-based materials (e.g. polyglactin), delayed-absorption sutures such as polydioxanone or non-absorbable sutures such as polypropylene. Furthermore, to improve the anatomical outcomes of anterior compartment prolapse, some techniques employ grafts. Graft material can be synthetic (e.g. permanent polypropylene, absorbable polyglactin mesh) or biological. Biological grafts can be further divided into autologous (from a person's own tissue, such as fascial sheath), alloplastic (from animals, such as porcine dermis) and homologous (such as cadaveric fascia lata).</P>
<P>The choice of operation depends on several factors, which include the nature, site and severity of the prolapse; whether additional symptoms are affecting urinary, bowel or sexual function; the general health of the woman; and surgeon preference and capability. Concomitant procedures are often performed to treat or prevent urinary incontinence at the same time. Mid-urethral slings and tapes that are utilised in continence surgery are not the topic of this review, and the reader is referred to <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2015</LINK> for a full review of continence surgery.</P>
<P>To aid in assessment of the surgery, clear preoperative and postoperative site-specific vaginal grading, details of the operative intervention and impact of the surgery on functional aspects of bladder, bowel and sexual function should be recorded.</P>
<P>Over the past five years and following significant litigation regarding outcomes of prolapse surgery after transvaginal polypropylene mesh, many of the products evaluated in this review have been voluntarily removed from the market (Prolift - Gynecare/Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA; Perigee American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA; Avaulta<SUP>®</SUP> - Bard, Covington, LA, USA), or companies have excluded transvaginal utilisation of the mesh product (Gynemesh PS, Gynecare/Ethicon). The reviewer needs to be mindful when reading this review that the data presented include some products that are no longer available for use.</P>

<P>The wide variety of surgical treatments available for prolapse indicates lack of consensus as to the optimal treatment.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-12 14:09:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available information on the repair of anterior compartment prolapse is increasing. Evidence generally is not supportive of the use of absorbable mesh or biological grafts as compared with native tissue for repair (anterior colporrhaphy) of anterior compartment prolapse. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2010-abstract" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2010 abstract</LINK>) compared anterior colporrhaphy and retropubic suspensions (paravaginal/Burch colposuspension) for anterior compartment prolapse and demonstrated similar outcomes for recurrent prolapse; however, the rate of dyspareunia was lower after the abdominal approach was used. These results should be viewed with caution, as the baseline non-randomised intervention was different in each trial.</P>
<P>Sixteen trials demonstrated advantages of using a polypropylene mesh as compared with native tissue for repair, including lower rates of awareness of prolapse, of anterior wall prolapse on examination and of rate of repeat surgery for prolapse. Disadvantages of mesh utilisation include longer operating time, higher rates of cystotomy, the need for transfusion, de novo stress urinary incontinence and subsequent prolapse of apical or posterior vaginal compartments. The rate of mesh erosion was 11.3%, and 7% required surgery to manage the mesh exposure. The total rate of repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, mesh exposure or pain was significantly higher after use of transvaginal permanent mesh (10.0%) than after native tissue repair (5.7%). The rate of postoperative dyspareunia was similar in the two groups. Investigators noted no differences between groups on validated pelvic floor dysfunction questionnaires, including the Prolapse and Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ), the Prolapse Quality of Life questionnaire (PQOL), the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20), the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ). The quality of evidence supporting these findings ranged from low to moderate.</P>
<P>In conclusion, data demonstrate a clear risk/benefit analysis that can help to guide clinicians and patients in deciding whether to utilise transvaginal polypropylene mesh as compared with native tissue for anterior compartment prolapse repair. Since 2011, some of the mesh products evaluated in this section, including Avaulta (Bard), the Gynemesh overlay, Prolift (Ethicon) and the AMS mesh kit (Perigee), have been removed from the market. However, separate evaluation of primary outcomes with products that remain available for use reveals little change in outcome measures except that rates of repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and mesh exposure have been evaluated under the auspices of randomised controlled trials. Newer, lighter-weight mesh implants available for the management of anterior wall prolapse have not been evaluated under the auspices of a randomised controlled trial.</P>

Few trials have reported clearly on whether participants and/or reviewers were blinded.</P>
<P>Generally, reporting on the impact of surgery on bladder and sexual function is improving; however, great variation is evident in trialists' choice of outcomes measures. Recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Delroy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Delroy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farthmann-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farthmann 2012;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Feldner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Feldner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamblin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lamblin 2014;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Rudnicki-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rudnicki 2014;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Sivaslioglu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sivaslioglu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamanini-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tamanini 2015;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Thijs-2010-abstract" TYPE="STUDY">Thijs 2010 abstract</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vollebregt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vollebregt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Withagen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Withagen 2011</LINK>) usually include a validated pelvic floor quality of life outcome and report data suitable for meta-analysis (mean and standard deviation). No trialists have provided a cost analysis.</P>
<P>To minimise risk of bias, it is preferable if surgeons who design studies do not have a financial relationship with the company whose product is being evaluated. Unfortunately, for several studies in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Tayrac-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Tayrac 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farthmann-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farthmann 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guerette-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guerette 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Withagen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Withagen 2011</LINK>), this conflict was feasible and was exacerbated by lack of assurance that reviewers were blinded, resulting in possibly heightened risk of bias for reported outcomes.</P>
<P>Although the rate of mesh exposure reported in this review is consistent with previous reports, adverse events of vaginal pain and/or dyspareunia were commonly reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in America, and this ultimately triggered the <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK> transvaginal mesh alert that resulted in voluntary removal of many permanent meshes from the market. Among the 15 included trials that evaluated permanent transvaginal mesh only <LINK REF="STD-De-Tayrac-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Tayrac 2013</LINK> reported the outcome of vaginal pain on examination at one year, at a rate of 18% in the mesh group as compared with 9% in the native tissue repair group. No reports among the nearly 1000 cases of transvaginal permanent anterior mesh repair described in this review described subsequent surgery performed for vaginal pain and/or dyspareunia.</P>

<P>The quality of evidence in comparisons of native tissue repair versus use of biological grafts is low to moderate owing to risk of bias and imprecision, with lack of reporting of study methods, especially blinding status of reviewers and participants, and unclear risk of data attrition. Low event rate was problematic for both stress urinary incontinence and dyspareunia.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence in comparisons of native tissue repair versus use of polypropylene mesh is generally low to moderate owing to serious risk of bias and imprecision. Bias was related to lack of reporting of allocation concealment and reports that reviewers were unblinded. Findings for stress urinary incontinence and dyspareunia were imprecise.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence in comparisons of native tissue repair versus absorbable mesh is generally low to very low, reflecting smaller, older studies with lack of reporting of study methods, risk of bias due to lack of blinding and high rates of attrition and imprecision.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence related to native tissue repair and use of polypropylene mesh for anterior and/or posterior compartment prolapse is generally low owing to risk of bias (with neither trial reporting methods of allocation concealment and reports that reviewers were unblinded) and imprecision.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-14 04:08:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) presented a report in late 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2014</LINK>) after reviewing literature described in the York report in 2012, commissioning another literature review in 2012, taking submissions from support groups and reviewing adverse event reports submitted to MHRA, engaging with professional organisations and regulatory bodies in the European Union and the USA and participating in the European Commission (EC) Task Force Group on vaginal mesh implants. The full report was extensive and on the basis of reported data concluded that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>for most women, the use of vaginal mesh implants is safe and effective; and</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>when these products are used correctly, they can help alleviate the very distressing symptoms of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP), thus resulting in benefit outweighing risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have demonstrated advantages associated with transvaginal mesh related to utilisation in the anterior compartment, where permanent mesh resulted in decreased awareness of prolapse, prolapse on examination and reoperation for prolapse; however, transvaginal permanent mesh was associated with increased morbidity, including increased operating time, blood loss, transfusion and cystotomy, and higher rates of de novo stress urinary incontinence and de novo dyspareunia, as compared with native tissue. The rate of mesh exposure was 11.3%, and surgery for mesh exposure was required in 7%.</P>
<P>We have concluded, in contrast to the MHRA 2014 report, that although mesh utilisation may be warranted in individual cases of anterior compartment prolapse, it cannot be considered a first-line treatment option for women with anterior compartment prolapse because of the not insignificant morbidity surrounding transvaginal mesh usage.</P>
<P>These differences in findings and conclusions between the MHRA 2014 report and our report can be explained by the fact that many new randomised controlled trials were not included in the MHRA 2014 review, which was informed by literature reviews published in 2012.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that in our review of nearly 1000 cases of anterior transvaginal mesh, we were unable to identify a single case in which further surgical intervention was undertaken for pain and/or dyspareunia, although these were among the leading adverse events reported to the FDA in the USA in 2011. In the MHRA 2014 report, adverse events were reported separately by healthcare professionals and members of the public. In reports from healthcare professionals, mesh exposure accounted for 42% of complaints, and pain accounted for 13%. In contrast, in reports made by the public, pain was the leading complaint in 15%, and mesh exposure was described in 12% of reports. The disparity between the facts that pain accounted for many complaints to regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom and the USA but it did not account for a single surgical intervention in nearly 1000 transvaginal mesh surgeries included in this review remains difficult to explain.</P>
<P>Furthermore, and in contrast to the MHRA 2014 report, we have highlighted that most of the data informing our report were derived from transvaginal mesh products that were voluntarily removed from the market in 2012, and that transvaginal mesh products currently available for use have not been evaluated under the auspices of randomised controlled trials. We believe it is prudent that until data on currently available transvaginal mesh products become available, these products should be utilised under the discretion of the local ethics committee.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-14 04:09:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first implication for practice is that little evidence supports the use of absorbable mesh or biological grafts in anterior compartment prolapse surgery. Distinct advantages and disadvantages of utilising transvaginal polypropylene mesh as compared with native tissue for repair have necessitated detailed consultation and consent before permanent mesh is used. Given the significant morbidity associated with anterior transvaginal polypropylene mesh, current evidence does not support its use as a first-line intervention for anterior compartment prolapse. Furthermore, as many of the mesh products evaluated have been voluntarily removed from the market, and given that none of the newer, lighter-weight, single-incision mesh products have been evaluated under the rigours of a well-designed randomised controlled trial, clinicians must be cautious in using these newer products and would be best served by doing so only after ethics committee review. Careful detailed and transparent consultation with individual patients is required before these procedures are performed. Reporting of longer-term results is encouraged.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-14 04:10:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urgent evaluation of newer, lighter-weight polypropylene meshes is needed to determine whether they are effective, and if morbidity is less than with earlier products. Trialists should include validated quality of life data in their methods. Newer materials, possibly produced via tissue engineering and bio-design, are worthy of further research to assist in the development of products that will supplement and deliver excellent anatomical and functional outcomes of reconstructive gynaecological surgery.</P>

Patients needing a concomitant anti-incontinence procedure and patients with diabetes mellitus or collagen disease were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant difference was found between groups in demographic data, degree of POP, and clinical or urodynamic findings. Sixty patients in the Gynemesh PS&amp;#174; group and 54 patients in the Pelvicol&amp;#174; group had previously undergone hysterectomy. All patients underwent regional anesthesia and received antibiotics: Ceftriaxone 2 g 1 hour before surgery and 2 g/day for 5 days after surgery and Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 5 days after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All underwent Tension free cystocele repair (TCR) and levator myorrhaphy and vaginal hysterectomy if required.&amp;#160;The sheets of both the Pelvicol graft and the synthetic mesh are trimmed to an identical rounded shape, with two lateral wings. In each operation, the central, rounded part of the graft is positioned under the urinary bladder in a tension-free fashion, while its arms are inserted deep into the periurethral tissue on both sides towards the pubic bone. A single fixating Monocryl 2/0 suture is performed at the base of one wing of the mesh, at the periurethral level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 2 years anterior vaginal wall recurrence was seen in 28% (27/96) of the mesh group as compared to 44% (41/94) of the porcine graft group (p=0.06). Urinary function post interventions was well described with a significant and equal reduction in slow urinary stream and incomplete bladder emptying in both groups and a non-significant and equal reduction in urinary urgency, urge incontinence and nocturia. The number of women suffering with increased daytime urinary frequency remained unchanged after the mesh procedure (33 to 26 , NS) as compared to a significant reduction after the porcine Pelvicol graft procedure (42 to 6 p=0.04). De novo stress urinary incontinence was seen in 2 women following the mesh and 1 after the porcine graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number suffering dyspareunia pre and post-operatively was similar in both groups (mesh pre 20 post 10 p=1.0 :&amp;#160; porcine pre 29 post 12 p=0.13). As regards sexuality, preoperative and postoperative PISQ-12 scores revealed no change in the Gynemesh PS&amp;#174; group (p=0.31) and a statistically significant improvement in the Pelvicol&amp;#174; group (p=0.03). Comparing postoperative data in the two groups, the authors reported a better impact of surgery on sexuality with Pelvicol&amp;#174; than with Gynemesh&amp;#174; p=0.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gynemesh PS&amp;#174; group, analysis of quality-of life questionnaires (P-QoL) revealed significant improvement in the following domains: prolapse impact, social limitations, emotions, and severity measures. Patients in the Pelvicol&amp;#174; group reported a positive change in all domains, with the exclusion of physical limitations. Comparing the postoperative quality of life in both groups, they demonstrated a superior outcome using Pelvicol&amp;#174; in the following domains: social limitations (p=0.04) and emotions (p=0.02).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who performed the reviews is unclear and the reviewer was unlikely to have been blinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is that Gynemesh was non statistically significantly superior to porcine graft in the management of anterior compartment prolapse at 2 years. Sexuality and P-QOL was superior in the porcine graft group as compared to the Gynemesh PS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-11-14 01:29:41 +1300" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Study authors concluded that at 12 months, anatomical failure was less in Gp B (Prolift mesh) as compared with Gp A. These findings were overshadowed by the fact that the 2 groups were significantly different before intervention in terms of important findings.

<P>
<B>Indications</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Vault prolapse or an enterocele</LI>
<LI>Often performed at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to prevent future prolapse</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Surgical technique</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>After removal of the uterus at the time of hysterectomy, uterosacral ligaments identified and incorporated into closure of the peritoneum and upper vagina with one to two sutures</LI>
<LI>Anterior or posterior vaginal repair often performed at the same time</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Sacrospinous fixation</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Aim</B>
<BR/>To offer support to the upper vagina, minimising risk of recurrent prolapse at this site. The advantage of this surgery is that vaginal length is maintained</P>
<P>
<B>Indication<BR/>
</B>Upper vaginal prolapse (uterine or vault prolapse, enteroceles)</P>
<P>Procedure can be used in reconstructive vaginal surgery when increased vaginal length is required</P>
<P>
<B>Procedure</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia</LI>
<LI>Routine posterior vaginal incision is made and is extended to the top of the vagina</LI>
<LI>Using sharp dissection, the vagina is freed from the underlying rectovaginal fascia and rectum until the pelvic floor (puborectalis) muscle is seen</LI>
<LI>Via sharp and blunt dissection, the sacrospinous ligament running from the ischial spine to the sacral bone is palpated and identified</LI>
<LI>Two sutures are placed through the strong ligament and are secured to the top of the vagina. This results in increased support to the upper vagina with no shortening of the vagina</LI>
<LI>Other fascial defects in the vagina are repaired, and the vaginal skin is closed</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Anterior vaginal repair (colporrhaphy)</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Indication</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Prolapse of the bladder or urethra</LI>
<LI>Sometimes used to treat urinary stress incontinence</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Surgical technique</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia</LI>
<LI>Vagina overlying the bladder and urethra is incised at the midline</LI>
<LI>Dissection in a plane directly below the vagina allows exposure of the damaged fascia supporting the bladder and urethra</LI>
<LI>Fascia is plicated at the midline via delayed absorbable or permanent sutures</LI>
<LI>Sometimes excessive vaginal skin is removed</LI>
<LI>Vaginal skin is then closed</LI>
<LI>Other sites of prolapse are repaired as required</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Posterior vaginal repair and perineoplasty</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Indications<BR/>
</B>Treatment of rectocele (rectum bulges or herniates forward into the vagina) and defects of the perineum (area separating entrance of the vagina and anus)</P>
<P>
<B>Aim</B>
<BR/>To correct defects in the rectovaginal fascia separating rectum and vagina while allowing bowel function to be maintained or corrected without interfering with sexual function</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical technique</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Incision is made on the posterior wall of the vagina starting at the entrance and finishing at the top of the vagina</LI>
<LI>Vagina and rectovaginal fascia are dissected from the vagina until the pelvic floor muscles (puborectalis) are located</LI>
<LI>Defects in the fascia are corrected by central plication of the fascia with delayed absorption sutures</LI>
<LI>Perineal defects are repaired by placing deep sutures into the perineal muscles to build up the perineal body</LI>
<LI>Overlying vaginal and vulval skin is then closed</LI>
<LI>A pack is usually placed into the vagina and a catheter into the bladder at the end of surgery</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Anterior or posterior vaginal repair, or both (colporrhaphy)</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Indications</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Anterior repair:</I> treatment for prolapse of bladder (bladder bulges forward into the vagina; cystocele) or urethra</P>
<P>
<I>Posterior repair:</I> correction of bowel prolapse (rectum bulges forward into the vagina; rectocele)</P>
<P>
<I>Vault repair</I>: treatment for prolapse of upper vagina</P>
<P>Depending on the side of the defect, the repair can be anterior, posterior, vault or total. Repair is achieved by placement of permanent mesh, which may result in a stronger repair</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical technique</B>
</P>
<P>Procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Anterior vaginal repair</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Midline incision to the vagina overlying the bladder and urethra</LI>
<LI>Dissection in a plane directly below the vagina and lateral to the bladder allows exposure of damaged fascia supporting the bladder</LI>
<LI>Fascia is plicated at the midline with sutures</LI>
<LI>Mesh can be used to reinforce the repair and can be used as an inlay or anchored through the obturator foramen, exiting through small incisions at both sides of the upper inner thigh</LI>
<LI>Vaginal skin is closed</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Posterior and vault repair</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Incision is made to the posterior wall of the vagina</LI>
<LI>Dissection below the vagina identifies the rectovaginal fascia and opens the space between the rectum and the pelvic floor muscle to the sacrospinous ligaments</LI>
<LI>Defects in the fascia are corrected by central plication of the fascia with sutures</LI>
<LI>Mesh can be used to reinforce the repair and can be used as an inlay or anchored bilaterally to the pelvic side wall, exiting through a small incision approximately 3 cm lateral and down from the anus</LI>
<LI>Vaginal skin is closed</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Vaginal paravaginal repair</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Aim </B>
<BR/>To reattach detached lateral vaginal fascia to its normal point of insertion on the lateral side wall. This firm area of attachment is termed the white line or arcus tendineus fascia pelvis</P>
<P>
<B>Indication</B> <B>
<BR/>
</B>Repair of anterior wall prolapse due to defects in lateral supporting tissues</P>
<P>
<B>Procedure<BR/>
</B>Procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia</P>
<P>
<B>Routine anterior repair<BR/>
</B>Sharp dissection of the vagina from the bladder fascia continues laterally until the pelvic side wall can be identified</P>
<P>Permanent or delayed absorbable sutures are placed from the lateral vagina to the firm pelvic side wall tissue (white line or arcus tendineus fascia pelvis). Three to four sutures are placed on each side</P>
<P>Routine anterior repair with midline plication of the fascia, trimming of excess vaginal skin as required, and closure of the vaginal skin</P>
