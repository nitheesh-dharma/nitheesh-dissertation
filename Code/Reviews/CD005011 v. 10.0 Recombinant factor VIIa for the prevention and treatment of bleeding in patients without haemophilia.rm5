<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-15 22:02:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence of effectiveness and safety for the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). This drug has been used in patients who are either at risk of major bleeding (e.g. because of planned high-risk surgery), or who have uncontrolled bleeding (e.g. related to trauma). There have been many articles in the literature describing the off-license use of this drug, which often suggest benefit. However, most of the publications are based on small numbers of patients (in case reports or case series) and may be affected by bias. Randomised controlled trials provide higher-quality research findings and allow us to assess the evidence of drug effectiveness with more certainty.</P>
<P>This review included 29 randomised controlled trials with 4290 patients. The trials showed modest reductions in total blood loss or red cells transfused (equivalent to less than one unit of red cell transfusion) with the use of rFVIIa. However, the reductions were likely to be overestimated due to the limitations of the data. We also observed an increase in the risk of having a blood clot in the arteries (such as a heart attack or stroke) in those patients receiving rFVIIa. When taken together, the data supporting the off-license use of recombinant FVIIa are weak. The use of rFVIIa outside its current licensed indications should be restricted to clinical trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-02 15:21:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is licensed for use in patients with haemophilia and inhibitory allo-antibodies and for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with congenital factor VII deficiency. It is also used for off-license indications to prevent bleeding in operations where blood loss is likely to be high, and/or to stop bleeding that is proving difficult to control by other means. This is the third version of the 2007 Cochrane review on the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients without haemophilia, and has been updated to incorporate recent trial data.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-24 19:10:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of rFVIIa when used therapeutically to control active bleeding or prophylactically to prevent (excessive) bleeding in patients without haemophilia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carolyn Doree">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other medical databases up to 23 March 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-06-26 23:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rFVIIa with placebo, or one dose of rFVIIa with another, in any patient population (except haemophilia). Outcomes were mortality, blood loss or control of bleeding, red cell transfusion requirements, number of patients transfused and thromboembolic adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-06-27 03:27:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Two authors independently assessed potentially relevant studies for inclusion, extracted data and examined risk of bias. We considered prophylactic and therapeutic rFVIIa studies separately.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Twenty-nine RCTs were included: 28 were placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs and one compared different doses of rFVIIa. In the 'Risk of bias' assessment, most studies were found to have some threats to validity although therapeutic RCTs were found to be less prone to bias than prophylactic RCTs.</P>
<P>Sixteen trials involving 1361 participants examined the prophylactic use of rFVIIa; 729 received rFVIIa. There was no evidence of mortality benefit (risk ratio (RR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.97). There was decreased blood loss (mean difference (MD) -297 mL; 95% CI -416 to -178) and decreased red cell transfusion requirements (MD -261 mL; 95% CI -367 to -154) with rFVIIa treatment; however, these values were likely overestimated due to the inability to incorporate data from trials (four RCTs in the outcome of blood loss and three RCTs in the outcome of transfusion requirements) showing no difference of rFVIIa treatment compared to placebo. There was a trend in favour of rFVIIa in the number of participants transfused (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01). However, there was a trend against rFVIIa with respect to thromboembolic adverse events (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.25).</P>
<P>Thirteen trials involving 2929 participants examined the therapeutic use of rFVIIa; 1878 received rFVIIa. There were no outcomes where any observed advantage or disadvantage of rFVIIa over placebo could not have been observed by chance alone. There was a trend in favour of rFVIIa for reducing mortality (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06). However, there was a trend against rFVIIa for increased thromboembolic adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.47).</P>
<P>When all trials were pooled together to examine the risk of thromboembolic events, a significant increase in total arterial events was observed (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>The effectiveness of rFVIIa as a more general haemostatic drug, either prophylactically or therapeutically, remains unproven. The results indicate increased risk of arterial events in patients receiving rFVIIa. The use of rFVIIa outside its current licensed indications should be restricted to clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-14 16:08:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) has been manufactured and used clinically for a number of years for the treatment of bleeding in individuals with haemophilia and inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII (<LINK REF="REF-Lusher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lusher 1998</LINK>) as well as other congenital bleeding disorders such as inherited factor VII deficiency and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. More recently, the potential of rFVIIa to minimise or control severe bleeding in a variety of medical and surgical situations has engendered considerable interest (<LINK REF="REF-Hedner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedner 2002</LINK>). The hypothesis that high-dose rFVIIa would be capable of enhancing haemostasis at the local site of injury, without systemic activation of the coagulation cascade and the risk of widespread inappropriate thrombosis, would clearly be an asset for clinical use (<LINK REF="REF-Key-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Key 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The initial evidence on the clinical role of rFVIIa for patients without inherited defects of haemostasis was dominated by case reports and small case series (<LINK REF="REF-Ahonen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahonen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greisen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greisen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Key-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Key 2003b</LINK>). However, over the years, data from randomised controlled trials have been reported, which should provide the most robust means of evaluating drug effectiveness and safety. These trials have assessed drug use in a variety of clinical scenarios in which rFVIIa may have a role, including excessive surgical bleeding, uncontrolled medical bleeding and trauma. However, bleeding in these clinical settings has multiple causes, including diffuse small vessel oozing, dilution of clotting factors and platelets from massive transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyperfibrinolysis, hypothermia (with slowing of the enzymatic reactions in coagulation) and acidosis, and it is unclear what effect rFVIIa would have on haemostasis in the setting of each or a combination of these factors. Many hospitals report that off-label use of rFVIIa as a general or 'universal haemostatic agent' has been increasing at least up until 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Isbister-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isbister 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Logan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Logan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Logan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the concerns about extending the use of a coagulation factor treatment such as rFVIIa to different patient groups is the potential for adverse effects, in particular the risk of thromboembolism (<LINK REF="STD-Levi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>To examine the effectiveness and safety of recombinant factor VIIa with the addition of larger randomised controlled trials, we have produced this third version of the Cochrane review on the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients without haemophilia, which was first published in 2007.<BR/>

<P>Two of the authors (ES, YL, SS or JB) screened all titles and abstracts of papers identified by the database searches for relevance. We excluded only clearly irrelevant studies at this stage; we assessed all other studies on the basis of their full text for inclusion/exclusion using the criteria indicated above. At this stage, two authors independently assessed eligibility and noted any discrepancies in their assessments.

<P>Aside from details relating to study quality, we extracted the following data.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Study characteristics - place of publication, date of publication, population characteristics, setting, intervention, comparator and outcomes. A key purpose of these data was to examine clinical heterogeneity in the included studies independently from the analysis of results. Potential sources of clinical heterogeneity in this specific review included details of intervention (dose, frequency) and participant group (condition, clinical setting).</LI>
<LI>Results of included studies - we extracted data for each of the main outcomes indicated in the review question. If an included study did not contribute data on a particular outcome we recorded the reason. We considered the possibility of the selective reporting of results on particular outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the numbers of outcomes in treatment and control groups. For continuous outcomes, we recorded means and standard deviations (SD). If median and interquartile range (IQR) were available, we used the median as the mean and converted the IQR to SD.</LI>

<P>Two authors extracted data using data extraction forms that were purposely created and piloted for this review. The authors resolved disagreements by consensus, recording the agreed data onto a third summary data extraction form. One author transcribed this into the systematic review computer software Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>); another author verified all data entry for discrepancies.</P>

<P>We rated these criteria using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This assigns a rating of 'Yes' (adequate), 'Unclear' and 'No' (clearly inadequate) to each specified methodological criterion. In addition, we added a criterion to the table to indicate whether a power calculation was performed for the RCT. A rating of 'Yes' was assigned if both a power calculation was performed and the target sample size was stated (regardless of whether or not this target was achieved), 'Unclear' if a power calculation was performed but a target sample size was not specified, and 'No' if no power calculation was performed.</P>

<P>We analysed data qualitatively and quantitatively. The preferred form of summary result was a risk ratio (RR) for binary data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When a study reported values on continuous outcomes for subgroups of different doses of rFVIIa, we used the mean of the reported values as an overall summary effect of rFVIIa for the meta-analysis.</P>

<P>The updated search (conducted 23 March 2011) identified a total of 140 new records since the last version, which three authors (ES, YL, SS) reviewed independently. <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> shows the study selection sequentially for each of the updates of this review.</P>
<P>Twenty-seven RCTs as full publications up to 23 March 2011 were eligible for inclusion. For the purposes of this review, we considered each of the studies by Boffard et al and Hauser et al as two separate trials, because they both concerned two different types of trauma: blunt (<LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK>) and penetrating (<LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010b</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The clinical setting of the included studies varied (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Five studies evaluated patients undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass (<LINK REF="STD-Diprose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diprose 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2009</LINK>). Six studies evaluated patients undergoing hepatic procedures: one in liver biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffers 2002</LINK>), two in partial hepatectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>) and three in liver transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planinsic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Planinsic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugliese-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pugliese 2007</LINK>). Five studies evaluated the role of rFVIIa in a variety of other conditions: paediatric craniofacial reconstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK>), retropubic prostatectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>), burn patients requiring excision and grafting (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2007</LINK>), pelvic fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>) and spinal fusion surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2007</LINK>). Both <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2009</LINK> were considered with the prophylactic group as rFVIIa was administered at the time of a defined bleeding trigger in the perioperative setting.<BR/>
</P>
<P>All studies reported predefined exclusion criteria except <LINK REF="STD-Pugliese-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pugliese 2007</LINK>. The main exclusions were evidence of pre-existing 'coagulopathy' in patients with known thromboembolic or vascular disease. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Diprose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diprose 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK> excluded patients who would refuse blood products while <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK> also excluded patients with neurological disorders, and both <LINK REF="STD-Planinsic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Planinsic 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK> excluded patients who had undergone previous transplantation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen of 16 trials compared rFVIIa with placebo. rFVIIa was given at a single dose in eight studies and as repeated dosing in eight studies, with three studies administering repeated dosing only if there was ongoing surgery or bleeding (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Thus there were marked differences in the doses and schedules employed. The differences are more apparent if the total dose administered is considered. This varied from 5 µg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffers 2002</LINK>) to 360 µg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Co-interventions</HEADING>
<P>The two main groups of important co-interventions were the use of additional 'haemostatic' drugs and transfusion (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Red cell transfusion protocols were provided in 13 studies with seven studies outlining further guidelines for platelets and/or plasma. Three studies provided no details on transfusion protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK>).  Co-interventions are also outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Of particular interest for thromboembolic adverse events, four studies described the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the perioperative (<LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>) and postoperative settings (<LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The prophylactic studies reported a variety of primary outcome measures (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, the main outcome focus of the included studies was either blood loss (primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2007</LINK>), amount of blood transfused (primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planinsic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Planinsic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>), or number of patients receiving allogeneic transfusion (primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Diprose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diprose 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>). Four studies did not define a primary outcome but collected data on blood loss and transfusion requirements (<LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugliese-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pugliese 2007</LINK>). Finally, one study in liver biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffers 2002</LINK>) used time to haemostasis and duration of normal prothrombin time (PT) as its primary outcomes and one study used a primary outcome of critical serious adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Gill-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK> reported adverse events including deaths and thromboembolic events. Active surveillance (planned ECG, troponin measurements or doppler ultrasound) was performed in five prophylactic studies (<LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planinsic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Planinsic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>All clinical trials were placebo-controlled but the doses of rFVIIa varied widely, as did its administration (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). rFVIIa was given as a single dose in the five ICH trials and as repeated dosing in the other trials, with one study administering repeated dosing only if there was ongoing bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>). The variation in doses was most evident when estimating the total dose of rFVIIa received.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The therapeutic studies reported multiple outcome measures (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). In the majority of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pihusch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pihusch 2005</LINK>) the primary endpoint was a measure of change in bleeding. By contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005b</LINK> defined the primary endpoint as transfusion requirements. The primary endpoint in <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK> was a clinical outcome as defined by the modified Rankin scale at day 90. <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Narayan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Narayan 2008</LINK> defined their primary outcome as the frequency of adverse events that were (possibly or probably) treatment-related. <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010b</LINK> measured all-cause 30-day mortality as the primary outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic trials</HEADING>
<P>All prophylactic studies had some threats to validity. For the most part, these potential risks of bias were due to lack of detail provided on the specific criteria and thus were judged as 'unclear'. Using the Cochrane grading system:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic trials</HEADING>
<P>For therapeutic studies, the potential risks of bias were mostly due to lack of detail provided on the specific criteria and we thus judged them as 'unclear'. Using the Cochrane grading system:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generation was adequate in seven studies and unclear in six;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment was adequate in six studies and unclear in seven;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants and personnel was adequate in 10 studies and unclear in three;</LI>

<LI>incomplete outcome data assessment was adequate in 11 studies and unclear in two;</LI>
<LI>free of selective outcome reporting assessment was adequate in seven studies (registered with a clinical trials registry), unclear in four studies and inadequate in two studies. The two studies judged to be inadequate were <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005b</LINK> where emphasis was placed on the analysis where patients who died within 48 hours were excluded and data for some outcomes were presented for those patients alive at 48 hours;</LI>
<LI>free of other bias assessment was adequate in two studies, unclear in 10 and inadequate in one. The study judged to be inadequate was <LINK REF="STD-Pihusch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pihusch 2005</LINK> in which there were baseline differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups;</LI>

</UL>
<P>All 13 RCTs using rFVIIa to treat established bleeding were reported to be double-blind and placebo-controlled, but two (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>) were felt to be largely free from threats to validity.</P>
<P>When compared to the prophylactic trials, the therapeutic trials were less prone to bias, particularly in the areas of blinding and selective reporting as judged by being registered clinical trials. Therapeutic trials were also on average larger in sample size than prophylactic trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death</HEADING>
<P>Mortality data were included for 15 trials. The individual results from all 15 studies had a 95% confidence interval (CI) that included 1.0 (no difference between rFVIIa and placebo). The pooled risk ratio (RR) was 1.04 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.97), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, indicating that observed variation in the study results was compatible with chance alone (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). In six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugliese-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pugliese 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>) no deaths were mentioned; thus the number of deaths was taken to be zero in all study arms. Control arm death rates were generally low across all studies, the maximum being 1/10 (<LINK REF="STD-Diprose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diprose 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blood loss</HEADING>
<P>Ten studies contributed blood loss outcome data. The pooled mean difference (MD) was -297 mL (297 mL less blood loss in the rFVIIa arms) (95% CI -416 to -178) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). There was marked variation in the amount of mean blood loss in the control arms, from 381 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK>) to 8552 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>). Five studies, each with fewer than 40 patients, had a 95% CI not including zero favouring rFVIIa (<LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugliese-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pugliese 2007</LINK>). These studies accounted for 20% of the included patients in the analysis but their MDs accounted for 82% of the pooled estimate.</P>
<P>Investigation of the heterogeneity is presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. Heterogeneity was explained in part by the size of the study. When only studies with greater than 50 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Gill-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2007</LINK>) were included, the I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% and the pooled MD was no longer statistically significant (MD -261 mL; 95% CI -550 to 28).</P>
<P>The pooled MD likely represents an overestimate of the effect of rFVIIa as four additional studies, each with more than 40 patients, reported no difference in blood loss and could not be incorporated into the pooled analysis because outcomes were not available as mean/standard deviation (SD) (<LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planinsic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Planinsic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>). The blood loss data were affected by heavy weighting towards several small studies that reported very precise estimation of blood losses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Use of red cell transfusion</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies were included in the pooled analysis for red cell transfusion requirements. The pooled MD was -261 mL (261 mL less red cells required in the rFVIIa arms) (95% CI -367 to -154) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%). Data in units of red cells were converted to millilitres assuming a single unit equated to 300 mL. There was marked variation in the amount of mean red cell transfusion requirements in the control arm, from 450 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>) to 5820 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2007</LINK>).

<P>Further investigation of the heterogeneity is presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>. Heterogeneity was explained in part by the size of the study.

<P>The pooled MD likely represents an overestimate of the effect of rFVIIa as three additional studies reported no difference in red cell requirements and could not be incorporated into the pooled analysis because outcomes were not available as mean/SD (<LINK REF="STD-Ekert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raobaikady-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raobaikady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2006</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of patients transfused</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies reported and contributed data on the number of patients transfused. The pooled RR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.01) with marked heterogeneity present, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Further exploration offered no clear explanation for heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). There was marked variation in the proportions of patients receiving transfusions in the control arms, ranging from 37% (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>) to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>). Two studies had a 95% CI that did not include 1.0 (no difference) (<LINK REF="STD-Friederich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Friederich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005b</LINK>); both studies showed a reduction in the proportion of people requiring transfusion with rFVIIa.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Thromboembolic events</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies contributed data on thromboembolic events. The pooled RR was 1.35 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.25) with heterogeneity accounted for by chance alone (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Control event rates were generally low across all studies, the maximum being 2/10 (<LINK REF="STD-Diprose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diprose 2005</LINK>). Individually the 95% CIs of all the included studies included 1.0 (no difference between rFVIIa and placebo). <LINK REF="STD-Essam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Essam 2007</LINK> was not included in the pooled analysis as no detail was provided on adverse events.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death</HEADING>
<P>All included studies contributed data on death. The pooled RR for overall mortality was 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06) with no statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). The mortality rates in the control group varied from 0/9 (<LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>) to 22/74 (30%) (<LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK>). All studies yielded a RR whose 95% CI included 1.0 when examined in separate dose groups. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK> the RR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.94).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control of bleeding</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials reported outcome data on the control of bleeding, four of which (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pihusch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pihusch 2005</LINK>) provided data appropriate for meta-analysis. The pooled RR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) in favour of rFVIIa, with I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The proportion of participants achieving bleeding control in the placebo arm ranged from 44% (<LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>) to 84% (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>). For all the included studies, the RR 95% CI included 1.0 (no difference).</P>
<P>The five intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narayan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Narayan 2008</LINK>) measured bleeding control in a different way from the other studies. Although appropriate to the condition they addressed, this meant that their results could not be combined quantitatively. We thus considered the additional insights they provided qualitatively alongside the above pooled RR. In the initial efficacy study (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK>), the trial authors reported a statistically significant reduction in the growth of haemorrhage volume in favour of rFVIIa. Additional data provided suggested that reductions in the increase in haemorrhage volume attributable to rFVIIa were associated with reduced disability as measured by the Modified Rankin Scale, the Extended Glasgow Coma Scale, the Barthel Index and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 90 days. The second efficacy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK>) defined its primary endpoint as severe disability or death by a Modified Rankin scale score of 5 or 6. Although this study did show a significant reduction in growth of volume of haemorrhage in the 80 &#956;g/kg rFVIIa group, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint at 90 days. None of the safety trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narayan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Narayan 2008</LINK>) showed a significant reduction in their secondary endpoints of growth of volume of haemorrhage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Use of red cell transfusion</HEADING>
<P>Five studies contributed data on the use of red cell transfusions (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010b</LINK>). The pooled MD was -89 mL (95% CI -264 to 87) with minimal heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 16%) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The use of transfusion in the control groups varied from 103 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>) to 2730 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK>). The 95% CI for the MD for all the included studies included zero (no difference).</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005b</LINK> were reported as median/range, therefore these could not be incorporated into the pooled analysis. The exclusion of these studies is unlikely to change the pooled MD as there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of number of red cell units transfused for all patients at 48 hours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of patients transfused</HEADING>
<P>Three of the 13 studies investigating the use of rFVIIa for treating bleeding collected information on the number of patients transfused (<LINK REF="STD-Chuansumrit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chuansumrit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010b</LINK>). These studies showed a trend to a lower number of transfused patients in the rFVIIa treatment groups (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Thromboembolic events</HEADING>
<P>All of the treatment trials contributed data on thromboembolic events. The pooled RR was 1.14 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.47) with no heterogeneity beyond chance expectation (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). Control event rates were generally low across all studies, the maximum being 3/8 (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2006</LINK>). Individually the 95% CIs of all the included studies included 1.0 (no difference between rFVIIa and placebo).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Thromboembolic events across all RCTs</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-six studies were available from prophylactic and therapeutic study groups to contribute to an overall combined estimate of the risk of thromboembolic events. The pooled RR was 1.18 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.48) with no observed heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). When considered as individual outcomes, there was no difference in cardiovascular, stroke or venous events. However, there was a significant increase in arterial thromboembolic events (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05) (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We assessed publication bias for each of the outcomes above. In the prophylactic studies, there was little or no asymmetry except for the outcome number of patients transfused. The funnel plot for the analysis number of patients transfused suggested that there may be small missing studies with RR &gt; 1.0 (favouring placebo) (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). In the therapeutic studies, there was no marked asymmetry in the funnel plots.</P>
<P>As noted in the methods section, we did review ongoing studies from our previous update. There has been no reported progress in ongoing studies since the last review despite adequate time for recruitment. This may also be a potential source of publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">How does this update differ from the previous review?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Results: potential benefits of rFVIIa</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a significant mortality benefit with the use of rFVIIa. This finding remains unchanged compared to the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2011</LINK>), despite the addition of recent RCTs. In this updated version of the review, the risk of mortality associated with the prophylactic use of rFVIIa changed from a RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.24) to a RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.97). For therapeutic studies, the trend towards decreased mortality in the previous Cochrane review with a RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.03) is similar to the current review with a RR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.08). Looking at the individual studies, <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK> was the only study that showed a mortality benefit and in this study, mortality was a secondary outcome. The subsequent phase III clinical trial in spontaneous ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK>) was unable to show an improvement in survival or functional outcome, even though a reduction in haematoma growth was seen. The group receiving 80 &#956;g/kg rFVIIa was found to have a more frequent rate of arterial events when compared to placebo. The question as to whether there may be clinical benefit in a subgroup of high-risk patients with spontaneous ICH is being addressed in two registered clinical trials which, at the time of writing, have just begun recruiting (<LINK REF="STD-Flaherty-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Flaherty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gladstone-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gladstone 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>As in the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2011</LINK>), the volume of perioperative blood loss and red cell transfusions for the prophylactic trials remained statistically significant in favour of rFVIIa. However, there was evidence of important statistical heterogeneity for these studies.</P>
<P>In this version, although not statistically significant, there is a trend towards a lower number of patients transfused favouring rFVIIa in the included eight prophylactic trials (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01) and three therapeutic trials (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.00) compared to the previous version (prophylactic RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02 and therapeutic RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.29 to 3.04). For the prophylactic estimate, potential publication bias may overestimate the benefit of rFVIIa.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Results: potential risks of rFVIIa</HEADING>
<P>In this review, thromboembolic events were not statistically increased in prophylactic (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.25) or therapeutic (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.47) studies. Pooling adverse events across both prophylactic and therapeutic studies did lead to an increase in arterial thromboembolic events (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05) (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>), which is a new finding compared to the previous version.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Sixteen trials including a total of 1361 participants examined the use of rFVIIa <I>prophylactically</I> to prevent bleeding. The studies were conducted in a range of clinical situations including cardiac surgery; liver biopsy; partial hepatectomy; liver transplantation; prostatectomy; burns excision; pelvic reconstruction; craniofacial reconstruction and spinal surgery. The main outcomes were mortality, blood loss, red cell transfusion requirements, numbers transfused and thromboembolic adverse events. All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), but many were prone to bias, particularly through lack of clarity about how participants were randomised. There was no effect on mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.97). Modest benefits were found in the outcomes of blood loss and red cell transfusion requirements (less than one red cell unit saved with rFVIIa treatment); however, these favourable findings were likely overestimated because data were not available from larger negative studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A statistically non-significant trend towards an increased risk of thromboembolic events with rFVIIa was also observed (see '<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>').</P>
<P>Thirteen trials including a total of 2929 participants examined the <I>therapeutic</I> role of rFVIIa for the treatment of bleeding. Again the studies were conducted in a range of different clinical scenarios including blunt and penetrating trauma; gastrointestinal haemorrhage; Dengue haemorrhagic fever; intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and stem cell transplantation. There was no difference in the outcomes of mortality (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06), control of bleeding, red cell transfusion requirements, numbers transfused and thromboembolic adverse events. All studies were placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>) were substantially free from bias; the remainder had threats, particularly lack of detail about randomisation. None of the pooled outcomes showed reliable evidence of an advantage (or disadvantage in the case of adverse events) of rFVIIa over placebo. However, there were trends towards decreased mortality, decreased number of patients transfused and increased thromboembolic adverse events with rFVIIa treatment (see '<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>').</P>
<P>Although there were no differences seen in the total thromboembolic adverse events, when arterial thrombotic events were considered for all studies combined, a statistically significant increase was observed (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05).</P>

<P>Issues relating to methodological quality of the trials have been described in the 'Risk of bias' figures (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Overall, all studies except four (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lodge-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Lodge 2005a</LINK>) had threats to validity. In most cases, the threats to validity were assessed as 'unclear' because details were not provided in the publications. Many of the studies, in particular the prophylactic studies, were also hampered by inadequate power due to small sample size. The clinical settings in which more than one adequately powered trial was conducted included trauma, partial hepatectomy, liver transplantation, cirrhosis with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>Concerning the validity of the findings of this systematic review, there are limitations. We were unable to obtain data from all authors to be used quantitatively in the meta-analysis and often the excluded studies were those that did not favour rFVIIa (specifically in the prophylactic trials, four RCTs in the outcome of total blood loss and three RCTs in the outcome of red cell transfusion requirements showed no difference between rFVIIa and placebo). In the therapeutic studies for the outcome control of bleeding, data from the intracranial haemorrhage studies could not be included in the pooled estimate because they expressed their results in a different manner (appropriately) from other therapeutic RCTs and so were considered qualitatively.</P>
<P>Publication bias remains possible. We examined funnel plots and detected publication bias in the outcome of number of patients transfused in the prophylactic RCTs where there were a lack of studies that favoured placebo over rFVIIa treatment. A potentially more significant source of publication bias was our inability to include unpublished but ongoing trials that have not been completed since the last version of this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-14 15:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>The findings of this updated review extend and are consistent with other published meta-analyses. The relevant Cochrane systematic reviews include <LINK REF="REF-Marti_x002d_Carvajal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marti-Carvajal 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-You-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2006</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Marti_x002d_Carvajal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marti-Carvajal 2007</LINK> examined upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with liver disease but at the time of the review, the only RCT included was <LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-You-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2006</LINK> considered haemostatic drugs for intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and included the first three RCTs of rFVIIa in ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2006</LINK>) but not <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK>. The meta-analysis showed reduction in risk of disability and death by the modified Rankin scale score but this was not consistent when an alternative outcome score (extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) was used. The use of rFVIIa was also balanced against a trend towards increased thromboembolic events. <LINK REF="REF-Ranucci-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranucci 2008</LINK> performed a meta-analysis of rFVIIa in major surgical procedures and included seven of the prophylactic studies included in this review. They found a significant reduction in the risk of receiving allogeneic packed red blood cells (odds ratio (OR) 0.29; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80) although the absolute amount of red cell transfusion received was not analysed. Estimates of mortality and thromboembolic events were similar to the estimates in this review for prophylactic studies.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review published by <LINK REF="REF-Hsia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 2008</LINK> reported similar estimates for mortality (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09) and thromboembolic events (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.58). <LINK REF="REF-Hsia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 2008</LINK> also found that rFVIIa reduced the number of patients requiring additional red blood cell transfusion (OR 0.54; 95%CI 0.34 to 0.86). In our current review, the absolute amount of red cell transfusion has been quantified; at least in the prophylactic setting, the estimated absolute amount of total blood loss or red cell transfusion requirement saved with rFVIIa treatment was less than one unit of red blood cells (RBCs) (the assumption in this review was that one red cell unit was equivalent to 300 mL). However, this was likely to be an overestimate of the effect as data from negative studies could not be incorporated into the pooled analyses as described earlier in the results. In the therapeutic setting, <LINK REF="REF-Hsia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 2008</LINK> identified one study (<LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK>) of four included RCTs favouring rFVIIa for the outcome of additional red blood cell transfusion. The numbers used in the meta-analysis and reported in <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK> for this outcome were based on the percentage of patients alive at 48 hours receiving massive transfusion (more than 20 units of RBCs). The number of patients requiring massive transfusion for all patients was not provided in the publication. Thus, although there may be an advantage to rFVIIa in decreasing blood loss and red cell transfusion requirements, we believe that this advantage is small when the limitations of the data and the absolute amount of blood saved are considered.</P>
<P>In line with the findings of our Cochrane review, a recent meta-analysis of the off-label use of rFVIIa in cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, intracranial haemorrhage, trauma and prostatectomy showed no mortality benefit among patients who received rFVIIa (<LINK REF="STD-Yank-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yank 2011</LINK>). In this review, the administration of rFVIIa was reported to increase the risk of arterial thromboembolism among patients with intracranial haemorrhage (risk difference (RD) 0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06 and RD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11 for medium- and high-dose rFVIIa, respectively) and the rate of all thromboembolic events among cardiac surgery patients (RD 0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10). Unlike previous studies of the off-label use of rFVIIa, <LINK REF="STD-Yank-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yank 2011</LINK> also reported a decreased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome among body trauma patients who received rFVIIa (RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.08).</P>
<P>More recently, <LINK REF="STD-Levi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levi 2010</LINK> reported on the risks related to rFVIIa use, by analysis of data held by Novo Nordisk. The authors reported that individuals who received rFVIIa experienced a higher frequency of arterial thromboembolic events when compared to patients who were given placebo (5.5% versus 3.2%, P = 0.003). This association was more pronounced among older patients over the ages of 65 years (rFVIIa: 9.0% versus placebo: 3.8%, P = 0.003) and 75 years (rFVIIa: 10.8% versus placebo: 4.1%, P = 0.02). In the <LINK REF="STD-Levi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levi 2010</LINK> study, there was no significant difference in the rates of venous thromboembolism among patients who received rFVIIa as compared to those who received placebo (5.3% versus 5.7%).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">How do the conclusions of this update differ from the previous review?</HEADING>
<P>This review provides the most up to date assessment of the effectiveness and safety of RFVIIa. With the addition of four RCTs, there was a significant increase in the number of arterial thromboembolic events observed among patients who received rFVIIa. Despite the greater number of trials, almost all of the findings in support of and against the use of rFVIIa could be due to chance, indicating ongoing uncertainty about the true effectiveness of rFVIIa in patients without haemophilia. Suggestions of a potential benefit of rFVIIa reside in the findings of decreased blood loss and red cell transfusion requirements and a trend towards a decreased number of patients who required blood transfusion and decreased mortality in the therapeutic setting. However, the findings of decreased blood loss and red cell transfusion in this review were modest and are likely overestimates of the true benefit of rFVIIa. There may be publication bias particularly in the number of patients transfused overestimating the benefit of rFVIIa, which has been found in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hsia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranucci-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranucci 2008</LINK>). Moreover, in direct (and even some indirect) comparisons of dose of rFVIIa, there was no evidence of a dose-response effect.</P>
<P>Any (small) benefits of rFVIIa are likely to be offset by its potential thromboembolic risks. These risks are likely to be underestimated and may be more serious and/or frequent in the real world than in the RCT setting when tight inclusion criteria apply. For many of the patients in the clinical settings of the included studies, a higher risk of thrombosis might be expected, for example, related to immobilisation and stroke. In addition, a history of thrombosis or vaso-occlusive disease was a criterion for exclusion in most of the included studies and active surveillance (e.g. scheduled lower extremity ultrasounds or troponin measurements) for adverse events was reported in only 11 of 29 trials. These greater risks are consistent with the analysis of passive surveillance of reports describing thromboembolic events for the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Reporting System, which indicated that many events following rFVIIa use occurred after unlabelled indications and often resulted in serious morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although a large, adequately powered trial with a strict transfusion protocol and active surveillance for adverse events could be designed to address with greater precision the effect size for use of rFVIIa, the results of this review perhaps question the need for such a trial. It seems unlikely that a large benefit for the drug exists based on the findings of 29 trials, and for those trials which initially found evidence of benefit, larger follow-up studies have not confirmed these earlier promising results. This has occurred in the setting of cirrhosis with UGIB where potential benefit in a subgroup of high-risk patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2004</LINK>) was not confirmed in the RCT looking specifically at this high-risk subgroup (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch 2008</LINK>). In the setting of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), the earlier trial showed benefit in a secondary outcome of disability and death (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005a</LINK>), however this was not borne out in the phase III RCT designed with a primary outcome of disability and death (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2008</LINK>). The phase III trial in trauma patients (<LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauser-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 2010b</LINK>) was terminated early due to a low likelihood of reaching a positive outcome, again not confirming potential benefits seen in the earlier trauma trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boffard-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Boffard 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to highlight specific gaps or areas where new RCTs are required now. Although there have been retrospective observational studies supporting the use of rFVIIa in refractory bleeding, such as in the setting of cardiac surgery, these studies are limited by the lack of a control group, lack of transfusion protocols and observer bias. Without performing large RCTs, one cannot exclude an effect of rFVIIa, particularly if compared to the use of another haemostatic agent such as tranexamic acid (which has demonstrated a safer risk profile) or fibrinogen concentrate or even more platelet transfusions in the post-cardiac bypass setting. In these situations, the immediate real risk of life-threatening ongoing haemorrhage is being weighed by clinicians against a potential risk of no benefit from rFVIIa or potential thrombotic harm. These related issues of prescribing behaviour have also been recently summarised by <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>In summary, the aim of this review was to update the assessment of the effectiveness and safety of rFVIIa in the management of bleeding in patients without haemophilia. We conclude that the clinical value of rFVIIa as a more general haemostatic drug, both as prophylaxis in high blood loss surgery and as therapy to treat uncontrollable bleeding, remains unproven. In addition, its use is associated with an increased risk of adverse arterial thrombotic events. Based on the available RCT data, there is little evidence of benefit for the use of off-label rFVIIa in patients without haemophilia.</P>

<P>Unrestricted, unevaluated administration of rFVIIa outside licensed uses is not justified on the basis of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified and analysed in this review. Administration of rFVIIa outside its current license should be restricted to rigorous research studies and clinical trials, planned to add to existing knowledge in a systematic way.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-06-27 03:27:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yulia Lin">
<P>The results of ongoing research should be actively monitored and systematically reviewed independently of the pharmaceutical companies with a financial interest in this drug. Any future RCTs should be adequately powered, focusing on clinical outcomes such as mortality, rather than blood loss and transfusion use. Continuing close attention to measurement of adverse, particularly thromboembolic, events is required.</P>
