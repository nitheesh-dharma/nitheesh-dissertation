<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 14:19:54 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission continue to increase, particularly among sex workers and their clients in low- and middle-income countries. Prevention efforts directed towards these infections in this at-risk population may have had an effect in reducing the overall transmission of HIV/STIs in the general population. Several successful behavioral interventions have been reported including interventions to reduce HIV/STI incidence and prevalence, change behavior, promote condom use, improve condom availability, and increase sexual health knowledge. The review found seven individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two cluster-RCTs and four quasi-RCTs involving 8,698 participants examining a variety of behavioral interventions to evaluate whether they reduced HIV/STIs rates or resulted in changed behavior among sex workers and their clients. Results showed that the interventions were effective in HIV/STI prevention, including reducing the incidence and prevalence of HIV and STIs. Furthermore, there were some differences in self-reported behavior including increased condom use and a reduction in the risk of drug use. However, these trials were small and generally had few participants. As a result, evidence for the effectiveness of social cognitive theory and promoting condom use in reducing HIV/STI incidence compared to other behavioral interventions was limited, because no RCTs examined the effects of these interventions on HIV prevalence or on sex workers other than FSWs. In future research and program agendas therefore it is important to assess other potentially more potent behavioral change strategies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 14:19:54 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 13 trials with 8,698 participants were included. Primary outcomes (HIV and STI prevalence and incidence) were reported in seven trials. Of these, HIV incidence was reported in only three trials. After a 6-month follow-up assessment, there was no evidence that social cognitive behavioral intervention was effective in reducing HIV incidence (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.22). However, there was a reduction in HIV incidence at 3-month follow-up assessment of promotion of female and male condom (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.38). Social cognitive interventions and promotion of female and male condom use were significantly reduced STIs incidence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96) and (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88), respectively. Secondary outcomes were identified in 13 trials. Meta-analyses showed evidence that interventions to promote the use of female and male condoms do reduce non-condom use (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.05) compared to promotion of male condoms alone, and that social cognitive interventions reduced drug use among sex workers (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.16) compared to standard care.</P>

<P>Available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing HIV and the incidence of STIs amongst female sex workers (FSWs). Given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing HIV/STI and the public health need to control transmission amongst FSWs, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. However, it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and that all of the trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries.</P>

<P>
<B>Description of the condition</B>
</P>
<P>In 2008, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reported that an estimated 2.7 million people (range 2.4-3.0 million) became newly infected with HIV, bringing the total number of people living with HIV to 33.4 million (range 31.1-35.8 million) worldwide. Overall, 2.0 million (range 1.7-2.4 million) AIDS-related deaths occurred throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). Most newly acquired infections occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and sub-Saharan Africa remains the most heavily affected region, mainly as a result of heterosexual transmission (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The high rates of HIV infection among sex workers as compared to most other population groups has affected rates of heterosexual transmission of HIV particularly in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). The term "sex workers" constitutes a meaningful single population for epidemiological purposes, but it encompasses female sex workers, male sex workers, and male-to-female transgender sex workers in a wide variety of settings (e.g. brothels, massage parlours, informal settings, and on the street). Such individuals are often the victims of discrimination (which can sometimes lead to violence), trafficking, legal persecution and societal ambivalence (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>), are socially stigmatised (<LINK REF="REF-Padilla-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padilla 2008</LINK>) and often have a precarious lifestyle due to economic difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Gu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gu 2008</LINK>). Sex workers and their clients, who typically include people such as truck drivers, security workers, sailors, dock workers, police, migrant workers and businessmen, are at high risk for HIV exposure. Moreover, previous research suggests that the numbers of their clients per night can have an effect on heterosexual transmission of HIV particularly in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ruxrungtham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxrungtham 2004</LINK>). The lifetime probability of a sex worker becoming infected with HIV is high due to multiple risk factors, including a large number and high turnover of partners, low levels of condom use, a high prevalence of STIs, and unsafe practices such as douching and use of inappropriate lubricants (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of countries reporting on indicators relating to sex workers significantly increased between 2005 and 2009. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV prevalence among sex workers ranged from zero in Comoros and Sierra Leone to 49% in Guinea-Bissau. Seven African countries (Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Nigeria) have reported that more than 30% of all sex workers had HIV (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomes-do-Espirito-Santo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes do Espirito Santo 2005</LINK>). Recently, about one quarter of all sex workers (26%) in Lesotho were reported to have had a symptomatic STI (<LINK REF="REF-Khobotlo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khobotlo 2009</LINK>). In Swaziland, transmission during heterosexual contact (including sex within stable couples, casual sex and sex work) is estimated to account for 94% of incident infections (<LINK REF="REF-Mngadi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mngadi 2009</LINK>). In 2008, Lowndes et al reported that between 13% and 29% of men in West Africa may have paid for sex in the previous year (<LINK REF="REF-Lowndes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowndes 2008</LINK>). Surveys in Kenya (<LINK REF="REF-Gelmon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelmon 2009</LINK>), Uganda (<LINK REF="REF-Wabwire_x002d_Mangen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wabwire-Mangen 2009</LINK>) and Rwanda (<LINK REF="REF-Asiimwe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asiimwe 2009</LINK>) suggested that sex workers and their clients accounted for an estimated 14%, 10% and 46% of incident HIV infections, respectively. Results from an RCT in Jamaica have shown that 25% of AIDS patients had had exposure to sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unprotected commercial sex is the most important risk factor for the spread of HIV in several parts of Asia. In Vietnam, 33% of male sex workers recruited from more than 70 sites in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2008</LINK>). The prevalence of HIV among male sex workers is more than twice that of their female counterparts and is currently rising in Thailand and Indonesia (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). Sex work is common among male-to-female transgender people in Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>) and high HIV prevalence has also been reported among transgender sex workers in studies conducted in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (22%) in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Girault-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girault 2004</LINK>) and Jakarta, Indonesia (59%) (<LINK REF="REF-Pisani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisani 2004</LINK>). In India, high HIV and STI prevalence were found among street-based FSWs (30% and 27%, respectively) and among those who work in brothels (34% and 13%, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Buzdugan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buzdugan 2010</LINK>). Clients of commercial sex workers are also at high risk of transmission. Given their high mobility and frequent sexual encounters with sex workers in other parts of Indonesia, these men could be the agents of the rapid spread of the HIV virus throughout Indonesia (<LINK REF="REF-Fajans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fajans 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Middle East and North Africa, surveys of bar-based sex workers in Djibouti have found HIV prevalence as high as 26%, while in Yemen it has ranged from 1% to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>); in Egypt, 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Shawky-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shawky 2009</LINK>); while in Algeria, Morocco and Yemen, the figures are 4%, 2% and 2% of their national populations respectively (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). The percentage of sex workers who report having used a condom during the most recent episode of intercourse ranged from 44% in Jordan to 61% in Yemen (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surveys in the Caribbean undertaken in 2005 identified high infection rates in Guyana and Jamaica (27% and 9%, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). In Latin America, particularly in Peru, 44% of men reported having had sex with a sex worker (<LINK REF="REF-Caceres-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caceres 2009</LINK>). Surveys in Guatemala and El Salvador have determined HIV prevalence among FSWs to be 4% and 3%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Soto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soto 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Description of the intervention</B>
</P>
<P>Several successful interventions have been reported among sex workers and their clients to reduce the heterosexual spread of HIV, including interventions to change behavior, promote the use of condoms, improve condom availability, introduce voluntary HIV counselling and testing (VCT), and educate about sexual health and the effective management of STIs. The effectiveness of behavioral interventions could be increased by aiming for important goals, such as a delay in the onset of first intercourse, a reduction in number of sexual partners, an increase in condom use, that could be achieved using multi-level approaches (e.g. targeting couples, families, social and sexual networks, institutions, and entire communities) with both HIV-uninfected and -infected populations (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Female condom interventions may help empower women to protect themselves when they are unable to avoid sexual relations with HIV-infected partners or cannot persuade their partners to use a condom.</P>
<P>Management of STIs was based on clinical diagnosis and serologic tests for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (<LINK REF="STD-Kamali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kamali 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Peer education enlists members of a specific group to encourage effective behavioral change among their peers (<LINK REF="REF-Cornish-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornish 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Steen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 2009</LINK>). Its initial goal is usually to modify individuals' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs to bring about healthy behavior.</P>
<P>Structural interventions which mobilize sex workers to engage in HIV prevention may address other factors, such as economic security, reducing stigmatization, community-based organizing (<LINK REF="REF-Ghose-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghose 2008</LINK>) and rights-based advocacy (<LINK REF="REF-Wolffers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolffers 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>How the intervention might work</B>
</P>
<P>A decline in HIV prevalence in Cambodia occurred when rates of consistent condom use during commercial sex rose from 53% in 1997 to 96% in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Gorbach-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorbach 2006</LINK>); and in China, consistent use of condoms resulted in a 70% reduction in HIV infections (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2009</LINK>). Other countries with epidemics driven by the sex work industry, such as Kenya and Uganda (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2006</LINK>), Chile (<LINK REF="REF-Barrientos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrientos 2007</LINK>) and India (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2004</LINK>), have experienced declines in HIV prevalence when sex workers and their clients used condoms consistently. Increasing condom use, however, depends very much on condom availability (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2010</LINK>). Therefore, making condoms available in rooms where commercial sex occurs is the most effective strategy to increase condom use (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 2000</LINK>). In addition, consistent condom use was significantly greater among males who perceived that some or all of the members of their male social networks used condoms consistently (<LINK REF="STD-Barrington-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 2009</LINK>). These results suggest that interventions to increase condom use are more effective when implemented in conjunction with social, network- and/or community-targeted interventions that change the environment in which decisions about safe sex behavior are taken.</P>
<P>Treatment for STIs was found to be more effective in reducing HIV and STI transmission when combined with the consistent and correct use of condoms (<LINK REF="REF-Laga-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laga 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>), suggesting that behavioral interventions for primary prevention may also serve to enhance the effectiveness of secondary prevention activities.</P>
<P>Peer education has resulted in substantial increases in STI and HIV knowledge and use of condoms, and in the reduction of HIV and STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Why it is important to do this review</B>
</P>
<P>Research in some countries has suggested that prevention projects resulting in increased condom use during paid sex could significantly reduce HIV transmission.</P>
<P>Various intervention strategies have been adopted to reduce HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients in low- and middle-income countries, and their results suggest that these interventions may play a significant role in preventing the spread of HIV; however, the effectiveness of these strategies has not been assessed rigorously through meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Given the potential effectiveness and low cost of these interventions, it is important to conduct a systematic review of their implementation in low- and middle income countries.</P>

<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized trials were considered for inclusion if they described behavioral interventions on any one of the outcome measures specified below, occurring in sex worker settings in low- and middle-income countries. Studies relevant to outcome measures, whether primary or secondary outcomes were included. The unit of randomization could be individual or cluster level. Studies that were not eligible, for example studies that did not randomly assign the sex workers in to the behavioral interventions and control groups, targeted not specifically sex workers population, assessed other interventions rather than behavioral interventions, or studies those not related to specified primary and secondary outcome measures were excluded.</P>
<P>Low- and middle-income countries were defined based on World Bank criteria and there are currently about 125 of these low- and middle-income countries with populations of over one million; in 1997, their combined population was more than 4.89 billion (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank</LINK>).</P>

<P>Many different sources of published and unpublished research literature were searched for studies of behavioral interventions to reduce HIV infection among sex workers and their clients. Reporting strategies of the effect of these interventions might not be uniform, and there may be much grey literature and many local publications reporting on this issue. The following databases and conference proceedings were searched using a comprehensive search strategy without restrictions on the language or country or publication status of relevant trials. The date range of the search was 01 January 1980 to the search date. The search was conducted on 28 September 2010.</P>
<P>1) <B>Electronic databases</B>
</P>
<P>Relevant databases were identified in consultation with the HIV/AIDS Review Group Coordinator and the Trials Search Coordinator for the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group's Trials Register, experts in HIV/AIDS research and service projects working in low- and middle-income countries, policy makers and healthcare administrators. This list served as the key document for the extraction of data from electronic databases.</P>
<P>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane HIV/AIDS group specialized register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstract International (DAI), EMBASE, LILACS, BIOSIS, SciSearch, INDMED, Proquest, and various South Asian abstracting databases were included in the database list. The publication sites of the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other international research and non-governmental organizations also appeared in the database list.</P>
<P>An extensive search strategy string was developed in consultation with the Trial Search Coordinator of the HIV/AIDS Review Group. All possible keywords were included in the string to enable an exhaustive electronic literature search. For further details see the <LINK TAG="APPENDICES" TYPE="SECTION">Appendices</LINK>.</P>
<P>2) <B>Hand searching</B>
</P>
<P>A hand search of key HIV/AIDS research journals was conducted because many publications from low- and middle-income countries might not have appeared in electronic databases.</P>
<P>3) <B>Personal communication</B>
</P>
<P>Key personnel and organizations working in HIV/AIDS intervention programs in low- and middle-income countries were contacted for published and unpublished references and data.</P>
<P>4) <B>Conferences proceedings</B>
</P>
<P>Conference proceedings were searched for relevant abstracts. Conferences included the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), 1996-2010; International AIDS Conference (IAC), 1985-2010; and International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS), 2001-2009.</P>
<P>5) <B>Cross-references</B>
</P>
<P>The bibliographies of studies identified by the procedures described above were further scrutinized to locate additional studies. The search strategy was iterative, in that bibliographies of the included studies were searched for additional references.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-12 15:43:58 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodology for data collection and analysis was based on the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
</P>
<P>Using the inclusion criteria described above, two of the review authors (WW and EO) independently assessed the potential studies that were identified as a result of the search strategy. Scrutiny for inclusion was based on the type of study, type of participants, type of interventions, and outcome measures. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and a third reviewer (RM) was consulted. For all excluded studies a summary statement about the exclusion reasons was made. Four authors (KS, RM, AK and NH) who are experts were informed of the included studies and conducted the data extraction independently.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
</P>
<P>Data was extracted independently using data collection forms. For eligible studies, two review authors (WW and EO) extracted data on trial characteristics including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting with another review author (RM). Data were entered into the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-Revman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revman 2008</LINK>) and checked for accuracy. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, contact with the authors of the original reports was attempted in order to elicit further details.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B>
</P>
<P>Two review authors (WW and EO) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by involving an additional assessor (RM). Standard guidance was followed for the assessment of the adequacy of methods to reduce the risk of bias across seven domains:</P>
<P>
<B>1) Sequence generation </B>(checking for possible selection bias)</P>
<P>For each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail to allow an assessment to be made of whether it would have produced comparable groups.</P>
<P>
<B>2) Allocation concealment</B> (checking for possible selection bias)</P>
<P>For each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence was described and a judgment made as to whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>
<B>3)</B> <B>Blinding</B> (checking for possible performance bias)</P>
<P>A description was provided of the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if they were blind, or if the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>4) Incomplete outcome data</B> (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</P>
<P>For each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcome, completeness of the data was assessed including checking attrition and exclusions was noted, along with the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusions where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, missing data was included in the analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>5)</B> <B>Selective reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was investigated and a conclusion reported.</P>
<P>
<B>6)</B> <B>Other sources of bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study all other possible sources of bias, including study design and early trial cessation due to data-dependent processes or extreme baseline imbalance were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>7)</B> <B>Overall risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Explicit judgments were made about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and its likely impact on the findings was assessed and reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
</P>
<P>1) Dichotomous data</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, results are presented as summary risk ratios (RR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI).</P>
<P>2) Continuous data</P>
<P>For continuous data, the mean difference (MD) was used if outcomes were measured in the same way among trials. Standardized mean differences were used to combine trials that measured the same outcome with different methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B>
</P>
<P>All RCTs, cluster-RCTs, and quasi-RCTs were identified.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
</P>
<P>For included trials, attrition levels were noted and the impact of including trials with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of the treatment effect was checked through a sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomized minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>Heterogeneity amongst trials was tested using an I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic in each analysis. A value of I<SUP>2</SUP>=0% indicates no observed heterogeneity. Where substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt;50%) was identified, a prespecified subgroup analysis was conducted. Subgroup analyses were planned based on the extent of control for selection bias. However, subgroup analysis considered the effects of different durations of follow-up or different routes that were not included due to a lack of available data.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases</B>
</P>
<P>Where reporting bias was suspected (see "Selective reporting bias" above), attempts were made to contact study authors, asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this was not possible and the missing data were thought to introduce serious bias impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results was explored through sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
</P>
<P>A meta-analysis was conducted using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-Revman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revman 2008</LINK>). Fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis was used for combining data where trials were examining the same intervention and the trials' populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where heterogeneity between trials' treatment effects was suspected, random-effect meta-analysis was used. The criteria of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to evaluate the quality of the evidence by outcome was performed (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was conducted for the primary outcomes of HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, STI incidence and STI prevalence. For the fixed-effect meta-analysis, a planned subgroup analysis was conducted, classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by Deeks (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>

</P>
<P>A total of 2667 citations published between 1980 and 2010 were obtained. Of these, 53 potential studies were identified for consideration. Overall, 13 trials with 8,698 participants were analysed. Of these, two studies in Madagascar (<LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>) used the same population, as did two studies in Mexico (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>). Two studies using previously published data (<LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>) were included because they included outcomes, which were not previously reported. The remaining 40 not eligible studies were excluded (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2006</LINK>- <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wechsberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wechsberg 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markosyan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Markosyan 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>), two cluster-RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>) and four quasi-RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swendeman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swendeman 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chiao 2009</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria.

<P>Seven out of 13 trials were conducted in Asia (four trials in India (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swendeman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swendeman 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>), one in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>), and one in China (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>), one in the Philippines (<LINK REF="STD-Chiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chiao 2009</LINK>), and one in Armenia (<LINK REF="STD-Markosyan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Markosyan 2010</LINK>). Four trials were evaluated in Africa (one in Madagascar (<LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>), one in Cote d'Ivore (<LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>), one in Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>), and one in South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Wechsberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wechsberg 2006</LINK>).

<P>Primary outcomes were identified in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>). Of these, three trials measured HIV incidence (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>), two trials measured the incidence of STIs ( <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>) and four trials measured the prevalence of STIs (<LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>). There were no trials that measured HIV prevalence. Secondary outcomes were identified in all studies.</P>
<P>Although most trials provided a follow-up period of at least 6 months to assess outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markosyan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Markosyan 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>) the duration of the follow-up varied across studies. The shortest was a 3-month trial that occurred in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>) whereas the longest follow-up was up to three years in a trial conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1) Social cognitive theory</B>
</P>
<P>Social cognitive theory identifies human behavior as a personal, behavior, and the environment factors interact (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>). Person and environment interaction involves human beliefs and cognitive competencies. Social influences and structures within the environment were developed and modified by this interaction. The third interaction, between the environment and behavior, involves a person&#8217;s behavior determining the aspects of their environment. The behavior also being modified by that environment. Despite behavior may varies from situation to situation, behavior is not controlled by situation itself rather than person. It means different responses can come from different people or from the same person at different times (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1989</LINK>). Therefore, this theory is useful to understand and predict both individual and group behavior, and identify strategies in which behavior can be changed.</P>
<P>
<B>2) Community empowerment</B>
</P>
<P>Community empowerment (also called community organization, -mobilization, or -action research) is a strategy used in public health, behavioral sciences, and social movements, that can mobilize people for recognizing structural barriers to improve health, and empower them to change these barriers. This method is distinguished from behavioral change, because it addresses behaviours through the active involvement of community members to design, execute, and evaluate their empowerment projects. Community involvement in the evaluation directly contributes to capacity-building and increased awareness in the target community (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>3) Microenterprise</B>
</P>
<P>Microenterprise intervention empowers individuals through micro-finance, teaching basic literacy, and training in specific economic livelihoods (e.g., tailoring, computer literacy). Microenterprise programs (e.g., micro-finance, micro-credit) have been reported effective in increasing women's economic well-being, in reducing interpersonal violence, in increasing reproductive health decision-making power, and broaden their role in household decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hashemi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hashemi 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schuler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuler 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>4) Peer education</B>
</P>
<P>This intervention provides training and support to community members and is usually conducted to effect change at both the individual and the group level, with the aim to modify the person&#8217;s knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, or behaviours. This strategy may effect change by modifying norms that contribute to individual change as well as changes in programs and policies.</P>
<P>
<B>5) Manager training</B>
</P>
<P>Manager training focuses on providing specialized, HIV-based information and education, reinforcing positive STI prevention behavior that addresses the managerial class, to increase their influence through providing positive reinforcement of their employee's safer sex practices.</P>
<P>
<B>6) Promotion of female condom use</B>
</P>
<P>This intervention promotes the use of female condoms properly, enhancing condom self&#8211;efficacy and negotiation skills and knowledge of HIV/STI transmission, HIV/STI risk assessment, and safer sex options. Early female condom introduction efforts were targeted to FSWs, because they are at high risk for HIV and other STIs and have an obvious need for a female- initiated method of protection. Introduction of the female condom has been more successful in shorter-term programs, particularly among sex workers and members of women's groups (<LINK REF="REF-PATH-and-UNFPA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">PATH and UNFPA 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>7) STI screening</B>
</P>
<P>The systematic strategy of providing STI antibody testing to a population of apparently healthy people without signs and symptoms of that disease for the purpose of detecting the number of people (or blood samples) infected with an STI. The primary aim is not to diagnose STI in a specific person. Screening programs might direct additional resources to groups with the most risky sexual behavior &#8212;e.g., sex workers, their clients, migrant workers, and those attending STI clinics (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>8) VCT</B>
</P>
<P>VCT provides individuals with knowledge of their HIV infection status, risk assessment, and promotes risk reduction. This intervention may effective in reducing the risk of further transmission of HIV by promoting safer sex (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Summary of main results</B>
</P>
<P>The current review addressed a number of HIV behavioral prevention interventions intended to reduce the transmission of HIV among FSWs in low- and middle-income countries. The review used comprehensive search strategies encompassing both published and non-published studies. In addition, strict inclusion criteria were followed to ensure that the review was focused on behavioral interventions among sex workers. The review's conclusions are weakened by the small number and size of the potential trials and by the insufficiency of the reported data for the pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials were identified which fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review, involving 8,698 participants. Of the interventions assessed, seven studies identified the primary outcomes but only three trials examined HIV incidence. Moreover, there was no strong evidence that these interventions reduced HIV prevalence. Nonetheless, results of meta-analyses of primary outcomes found that the interventions did have an effect in reducing HIV incidence among FSWs assigned to a social cognitive intervention compared with those received standard counselling for HIV/STIs (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>) and interventions promoting the use of female and male condoms were more effective compared than those that promoted male condoms only (<LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, other primary outcomes, such as the incidence of STIs, were assessed by various interventions such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Social cognitive theory, which was found to be effective in reducing the incidence of any STIs in India by 43% (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Promotion of condom use, which reduced gonorrhoea and chlamydia incidence in Thailand by 37% and 29%, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>Peer education intervention in addition to clinic-based counselling conducted which reduced prevalence of chlamydia and of any STIs by 30% and 20%, respectively in Madagascar (<LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>Intensive STI screening, which reduced HIV incidence by 35%, and chlamydia trachomatis and gonorrhoea prevalence by 77% and 62%, respectively in Cote d'Ivore (<LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>VCT intervention, which led to a 78% reduction in prevalence of genital warts among FSWs in China (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>Prevalence of STIs was also reported by a community empowerment intervention in India (<LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>), but no intervention effect was found.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Meta-analyses also were performed for two secondary outcomes; changes in behavior outcomes such as consistent condom use, including female and male condom use; and drug use risk behavior. These meta-analyses showed strong effects of the promotion of condom use in intervention and control groups, including increases in female condom use rather than male condom use. However, this was positively correlated with increased condom use by clients, a finding not repeated in other results from the meta-analysis. There was a difference between social cognitive theory and standard care in the reduction of illicit drug use among FSWs. Substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>&gt;50%) in this review were identified in two meta-analyses assessed consistent condom use through community empowerment intervention (81%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) and through promotion of female and male condom use (65%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) indicated that variability in methodological, implementation of interventions, settings or populations may be differ. No observed heterogeneity were observed among studies whether evaluated consistent condom use through social cognitive intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) or through promotion of condom use (<LINK REF="CMP-009.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.4</LINK>) indicated studies contributed for meta-analysis is a similar way.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of behavioral interventions for other secondary outcomes was analysed. Results were</P>
<UL>
<LI>A positive increase in the rate of consistent use of condoms with regular partners by 45% as a result of a community empowerment intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2010</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>The addition of an education intervention to a microenterprise intervention conducted in India was associated with a reduction in the number of sex exchange partners (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>The addition of manager training to peer education was found to increase the likelihood of HIV testing among FSWs in the Philippines (<LINK REF="STD-Chiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chiao 2009</LINK>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is not possible to conclude definitively that no positive effect has been achieved by some interventions, either due to small sample size or failure in the design of the studies, or both. This clearly highlights of the need to clarify these issues for policy-makers and researchers considering affordable options for improving the quality of interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV in resource-limited settings. It also indicates the importance of good study design when implementing behavioral intervention programs of previously unknown quality.</P>
<P>This review was limited to examining the available literature on female sex workers. Given their high mobility and high risk of HIV exposure, male and transgender sex workers and their clients should also be taken into account when considering the spread of STIs. In spite of limited data, a number of non-RCTs have determined the effect of HIV/AIDS behavioral interventions in preventing HIV/STIs among targeted male sex workers (<LINK REF="STD-Maticka_x002d_Tyndale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maticka-Tyndale 1997</LINK> in Thailand), male transgender sex workers (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK> in Pakistan), and male clients of sex workers (<LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2000</LINK> in Senegal, <LINK REF="STD-Barrington-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 2009</LINK> in Dominican Republic, and <LINK REF="STD-Hoque-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hoque 2009</LINK> in Bangladesh), however, this systematic review did not include non-RCTs, so these studies and the evidence from them were not available to support the results in this review.</P>
<P>Although some trials provided only minimal details of follow-up length, the length or intensity of the interventions varied across trials. It is important to note that follow-up assessments over six months might have seen a reduction in the incidence rates of STIs in Thailand, Madagascar and Mexico (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>) and STI prevalence in China (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>), and in the number of sex exchange partners in India (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>) compared with shorter or longer follow-up assessments. Conversely, the results from the current review of consistent condom use did not depend on the duration of the follow-up period. For example, results from an RCT in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>) showed effective use of female condoms after a 6-month follow up period and after a 24-month follow up period, but the intervention failed to increase male condom use after a 24-month assessment period, which means this phenomenon was not specific enough to measure the reduction of HIV/STI incidence and prevalence. This indicates that effective behavioral change interventions to increase condom usage may be long-lasting and sustainable, which is an important consideration in dealing with hard-to-reach, hidden and mobile populations such as sex workers.</P>
<P>Despite its limitations, our review provides scientific evidence to support social cognitive theory intervention and the promotion of male and female condom use in order to reduce the transmission of HIV/STIs in vulnerable populations, especially FSWs, when compared with other behavioral approaches or no interventions. This meta-analysis also could inform the design and implementation of future studies, especially in terms of the choice of target population, setting, intensity of assessment, and the content of the intervention, and the findings of the studies included in this review, as well as the methods that were successful, should be considered by policy-makers, health workers and researchers in designing new interventions for these communities.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>A total of 13 trials were selected for review. However, the available data are limited for some outcomes and the results should thus be interpreted with caution. Although the data is available, it is not clear how easy it would be to apply the interventions to other settings, or to generalize the findings to other population groups. Studies identifying the effects of behavioral interventions on HIV prevalence were not considered in this review although this outcome is undoubtedly important in the reduction of HIV transmission among sex workers. The interventions for all sex workers were reviewed but only FSW programs were eligible based on randomised methods. Male and transgender sex workers and their clients were not included in the review due to the unavailability of data and due to these factors the results of the meta-analyses can only be applied to FSWs. Also, there was heterogeneity in the intervention effects for many of the outcomes, and there is no information as to the specific factors that might have caused the differences between the intervention and control groups. However, with regard to our objective, the findings of the review indicate that the use of social cognitive-based theory and the promotion of female and male condom use as HIV behavioral prevention strategies play an important role in reducing HIV/STI incidence, along with increasing condom use consistently and reducing illegal drug use risk behavior among FSWs in low- and middle-income countries. Because these interventions are likely to be low-cost, capable of being implemented by relatively unskilled workers, and can be easily maintained over long periods, they provide an important tool for controlling the spread of HIV amongst high-risk groups in low- and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence has been assessed using the GRADE process (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>), and the results are presented in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 4</LINK>. The GRADE approach uses four levels of quality (very low, low, moderate and high) over several domains covering limitations in the design and implementation of studies, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency in results, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias. The highest quality rating was found in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chiao 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>). The assessment of the risk of bias in these trials suggests concern regarding insufficient information of sequence generation, allocation concealment and failure to adequately address incomplete outcome data. Methodological quality was rated as "high" for only four of the thirteen trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fontanet 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2010</LINK>), .</P>
<P>
<B>Potential biases in the review process</B>
</P>
<P>All authors have an interest in HIV behavior prevention interventions, and each brings a different perspective to the methods used. However, we made efforts to limit the bias in several ways: two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias independently. Although the authors' views varied, after extensive discussion and achieving a consensus, we decided to accept the final conclusions. We knew that a meta-analysis might be vulnerable to publication bias in the review process. However, we were not able to use funnel plots due to the heterogeneity of the study designs. But we did try to ensure that our eventual conclusion arose solely from the data. Feedback from readers internationally will serve to improve the next review update.</P>
<P>
<B>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</B>
</P>
<P>These results indicate that combined HIV behavioral prevention strategies have a greater potential for positive results than single interventions such as peer education or manager training alone (<LINK REF="STD-Chiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chiao 2009</LINK>). These results are consistent with those from cluster non-RCTs that tested the combined effects of educational interventions and the promotion of condom use in reducing HIV and STI incidence in India (<LINK REF="STD-Bhave-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bhave 1995</LINK>) and Indonesia (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2002</LINK>). However, when a health education intervention was combined with the promotion of condoms, it resulted in the intervention having either no effect or in an increase in condom use among FSWs in Nicaragua (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 2000</LINK>). The effectiveness of these interventions, moreover, may not be assumed when the objective is, for example, to improve the knowledge of HIV/STI, or to change self-reported or observed behavior, such as sexual risk behavior and the frequency of sexual encounters. Our systematic review in low- and middle income countries shows that not all behavioral interventions have a positive impact when it comes to preventing HIV/STI infections or other secondary outcomes. This finding is consistent with the systematic review of interventions for sex workers in high-income countries, in which the effect of behavioral interventions did not significantly reduce the STI incidence and increase the use of condoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-17 14:19:55 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Windy Mariane Virenia Wariki">
<P>HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients helps to drive a broader epidemic of heterosexually-acquired HIV (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>), resulting in transmission even among individuals who engage in low levels of risk behavior. Interventions to reduce the risk of HIV transmission amongst these high-risk groups are therefore an important part of the international response to the HIV epidemic, and should be assessed carefully for their suitability, cost and effectiveness. This review strongly considers the effectiveness of several ongoing behavioral interventions that are likely to be available to policy makers and healthcare workers in low- and middle-income nations. Policy makers, practitioners and researchers therefore have a greater range of choice of potential interventions to reduce HIV transmission risk among high-risk groups. Before making a practice decision based on the current review, further information from other reviews considering how the role of combining sexual risk reduction, condom promotion and improved access to STI treatment reduces HIV and STI acquisition in sex workers receiving these interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Shahmanesh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahmanesh 2008</LINK>) should to be taken into account. Nevertheless, given the observed effectiveness of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing transmission of HIV/STIs, and the clear need for a reduction in transmission, these behavioral interventions should be considered for implementation in high-risk FSW communities in low- and middle-income countries. This decision should be supported, however, by the knowledge that there is lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and although there is evidence in favour of their implementation amongst other high-risk populations (such as transgender sex workers) the quality of this evidence is not currently sufficient to conclude that they will be effective amongst these populations. The studies reviewed here did not cover the full range of developing nations, but were spread across three continents and so be sufficient to inform policy-makers from nations not represented in the current review. This review finds that the effects of some interventions were sustained in radically different national and local settings, indicating that the interventions be suitable in most low- and middle-income countries.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-17 14:19:55 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Windy Mariane Virenia Wariki">
<P>Researchers designing new RCTs in to measure intervention effects should strongly consider measuring HIV incidence and prevalence as outcomes, and assess risk-factors for the spread of this infection. More high quality RCTs are urgently needed to further clarify which behavioral interventions are most effective in reducing the transmission of HIV among high-risk, hidden or marginalized populations in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, because sub-Saharan Africa remains the most heavily affected region of heterosexual transmission, including among sex workers, critical evaluation of interventions there should be conducted. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of these interventions, particularly social cognitive behavioral interventions and the promotion of condom use as effective strategies targeted at vulnerable populations should be a priority area for research. Therefore, detailed data on the cost of interventions should be collected and analysed in a standardized format, and future implementation programs should consider enhanced study design and collection methods, to ensure that key findings from those studies are valid, generalizable and of high quality.</P>

<P>"Community empowerment" versus "standard care"</P>
<P>Intervention: FSWs received basic STI information. Additionally, health clinics were established in the centre of both communities' red light areas to improve existing care for sex workers. They also received training by a team of local peer educators to build skills and confidence in providing education and to foster empowerment and advocacy for local sex workers. The training comprised empowerment and advocacy, included sustained engagement with local sex workers, showed interest in sex workers' health and well-being and that of their children, nurtured group solidarity among them, and raised consciousness about sex worker rights.</P>
<P>Control: FSWs did not receive the enhanced intervention to prevent HIV and STIs.</P>
