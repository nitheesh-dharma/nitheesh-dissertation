<P>Acupuncture and hypnosis may help relieve pain during labour, but more research is needed on these and other complementary therapies.</P>
<P>The pain of labour can be intense, with tension, anxiety and fear making it worse. Many women would like to labour without using drugs, and turn to alternatives to manage pain. Many alternative methods are tried in order to help manage pain and include acupuncture, mind-body techniques, massage, reflexology, herbal medicines or homoeopathy, hypnosis and music. We found evidence that acupuncture and hypnosis may help relieve labour pain. There is insufficient evidence about the benefits of music, massage, relaxation, white noise, acupressure, aromatherapy, and no evidence about the effectiveness of massage or other complementary therapies.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain management in labour and this may contribute towards the popularity of complementary methods of pain management. This review examined currently available evidence supporting the use of alternative and complementary therapies for pain management in labour. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effects of complementary and alternative therapies for pain management in labour on maternal and perinatal morbidity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1980 to February 2006) and CINAHL (1980 to February 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The inclusion criteria included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing complementary and alternative therapies (but not biofeedback) with placebo, no treatment or pharmacological forms of pain management in labour. All women whether primiparous or multiparous, and in spontaneous or induced labour, in the first and second stage of labour were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Meta-analysis was performed using relative risks for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. The outcome measures were maternal satisfaction, use of pharmacological pain relief and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials were included in the review with data reporting on 1537 women using different modalities of pain management; 1448 women were included in the meta-analysis. Three trials involved acupuncture (n = 496), one audio-analgesia (n = 24), two trials acupressure (n = 172), one aromatherapy (n = 22), five trials hypnosis (n = 729), one trial of massage (n = 60), and relaxation (n = 34). The trials of acupuncture showed a decreased need for pain relief (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.00, two trials 288 women). Women taught self-hypnosis had decreased requirements for pharmacological analgesia (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79, five trials 749 women) including epidural analgesia (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.40) and were more satisfied with their pain management in labour compared with controls (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.71, one trial). No differences were seen for women receiving aromatherapy, or audio analgesia. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Acupuncture and hypnosis may be beneficial for the management of pain during labour; however, the number of women studied has been small. Few other complementary therapies have been subjected to proper scientific study.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Labour presents a physiological and psychological challenge for women. As labour becomes more imminent this can be a time of conflicting emotions; fear and apprehension can be coupled with excitement and happiness. Tension, anxiety and fear are factors contributing towards women's perception of pain and may also affect their labour and birth experience. Pain associated with labour has been described as one of the most intense forms of pain that can be experienced (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1984</LINK>). Pain experienced by women in labour is caused by uterine contractions, the dilatation of the cervix and, in the late first stage and second stage, by stretching of the vagina and pelvic floor to accommodate the baby. However, the complete removal of pain does not necessarily mean a more satisfying birth experience for women (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1982</LINK>). Effective and satisfactory pain management need to be individualised for each woman.<BR/> <BR/>The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become popular with consumers worldwide. Studies suggest that between 30% and 50% of adults in industrialised nations use some form of CAM to prevent or treat health-related problems (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 1998</LINK>). Complementary therapies are more commonly used by women of reproductive age, with almost half (49%) reporting use (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>). It is possible that a significant proportion of women are using these therapies during pregnancy. A recent survey of 242 pregnant women in the United States reported that complementary therapies were used by 9% of women. Herbs were the most frequently used therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2001</LINK>). Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain relief in labour and this may contribute towards the popularity of complementary methods of pain management (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The Complementary Medicine Field of the Cochrane Collaboration defines complementary medicine as 'practices and ideas which are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries', which are defined by its users as 'preventing or treating illness, or promoting health and wellbeing' (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2006</LINK>). This definition is deliberately broad as therapies considered complementary practices in one country or culture may be conventional in another. Many therapies and practices are included within the scope of the Complementary Medicine Field. These include treatments people can administer themselves (e.g. botanicals, nutritional supplements, health food, meditation, magnetic therapy), treatments providers administer (e.g. acupuncture, massage, reflexology, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulations), and treatments people can administer under the periodic supervision of a provider (e.g. yoga, biofeedback, Tai Chi, homoeopathy, Alexander therapy, Ayurveda).</P>
<P>The most commonly cited complementary medicine and practices associated with providing pain management in labour can be categorised into mind-body interventions (e.g. yoga, hypnosis, relaxation therapies), alternative medical practice (e.g. homoeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine), manual healing methods (e.g. massage, reflexology), pharmacologic and biological treatments, bioelectromagnetic applications (e.g. magnets) and herbal medicines. The use of immersion in water to reduce labour pain is not included in this review and is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mind-body interventions such as relaxation, meditation, visualisation and breathing are commonly used for labour, and can be widely accessible to women through teaching of these techniques during antenatal classes. Yoga, meditation and hypnosis may not be so accessible to women but together these techniques may have a calming effect and provide a distraction from pain and tension (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1999a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Hypnosis appears to be a state of narrow focused attention, reduced awareness of external stimuli, and an increased response to suggestions (<LINK REF="REF-Gamsa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamsa 2003</LINK>). Suggestions are verbal or non-verbal communications that result in apparent spontaneous changes in perception, mood or behaviour. These therapeutic communications are directed to the patient's subconscious and the responses are independent of any conscious effort or reasoning. Women can learn self-hypnosis which can be used in labour to reduce pain from contractions. Recent advances in neuro-imaging have led to increased understanding of the neuro-physiological changes occurring during hypnosis induced analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Maquet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maquet 1999</LINK>). The anterior cingulate gyrus has been demonstrated, by positron emission tomography, to be one of the sites in the brain affected by hypnotic modulation of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Faymonville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faymonville 2000</LINK>). The suppression of neural activity, between the sensory cortex and the amygdala-limbic system, appears to inhibit the emotional interpretation of sensations being experienced as pain.</P>
<P>Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into different parts of the body. Other acupuncture related techniques include laser acupuncture and acupressure (applying pressure on the acupuncture point). These techniques all aim to treat illnesses and soothe pain by stimulating acupuncture points. Acupuncture points used to reduce labour pain are located on the hands, feet and ears. Several theories have been presented as to exactly how acupuncture works. One theory proposes that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various 'gates' to these areas (<LINK REF="REF-Wall-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wall 1967</LINK>). Since the majority of acupuncture points are either connected to, or located near, neural structures, this suggests that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce endorphins, which reduce pain (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeranz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeranz 1989</LINK>). Other pain-relieving substances called opioids may be released into the body during acupuncture treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aromatherapy, the use of the essential oils, draws on the healing powers of plants. The mechanism of action for aromatherapy is unclear. Studies investigating psychological and physiological effects of essential oils showed no change on physiological parameters such as blood pressure or heart rate but did produce psychological improvement in mood and anxiety levels (<LINK REF="REF-Stevensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevensen 1995</LINK>). Essential oils are thought to increase the output of the body's own sedative, stimulant and relaxing substances. The oils may be massaged into the skin, or inhaled by using a steam infusion or burner. Aromatherapy is increasing in popularity among midwives and nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Allaire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allaire 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Homoeopathy works on the principle that 'like cures like'. Homoeopathic remedies are prescribed as potencies as a result of tiny and highly diluted amounts of the substances from which they are derived. The more times the substance is diluted and succussion (vigorous shaking) is performed, the greater the potency of the homoeopathic remedy. The principle of treatment is that the homoeopathic substance will stimulate the body and healing functions so achieving a state of balance with relief of symptoms. Homoeopathic remedies are all natural medicines. Remedies are derived from herbs, minerals or other natural substances. Remedies used in labour are given according to the type or types of pain being experienced and the emotions the woman is feeling. It is proposed that homoeopathy stimulates a woman's physiological processes so they function well, enabling her to cope with labour and to soothe and relax the woman emotionally which may reduce her pain (<LINK REF="REF-Charlish-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charlish 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Manual healing methods include massage and reflexology. Massage involves manipulation of the body's soft tissues. It is commonly used to help relax tense muscles and to soothe and calm the individual. A woman who is experiencing backache during labour may find massage over the lumbosacral area soothing. Some women find abdominal massage comforting. Different massage techniques may suit different women. Massage may help to relieve pain by assisting with relaxation, inhibiting pain signals or by improving blood flow and oxygenation of tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reflexologists propose that there are reflex points on the feet corresponding to organs and structures of the body and that pain may be reduced by gentle manipulation or pressing certain parts of the foot. Pressure applied to the feet has been shown to result in an anaesthetizing effect on other parts of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review examines currently available evidence regarding the effectiveness of the above therapies and other alternative and complementary therapies for pain management in labour but not biofeedback, which will be the focus of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Barrag_x00e1_n-Loayza-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barragán Loayza 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (February 2006).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>monthly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness search of a further 37 journals.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the 'Search strategies for identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are given a code (or codes) depending on the topic. The codes are linked to review topics. The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using these codes rather than keywords.</P>
<P>In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (T<I>he Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), CINAHL (1980 to February 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2006) using a combination of subject headings and text words. The subject headings included obstetrics, labor, birth, pain, complementary medicine, alternative medicine. The text words included the different complementary therapies: "acupuncture, reflexology, aromatherapy, massage, homoeopathy, yoga, meditation, imagery or visualisation, relaxation, hypnosis, breathing exercises".</P>
<P>We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We evaluated trials for their appropriateness for inclusion. Where there was uncertainty about inclusion of the study, the full text was retrieved. The original author was contacted for further information where possible. If there was disagreement between review authors about the studies to be included that could not be resolved by discussion, assistance from the third review author was sought. Reasons for excluding trials have been stated. Excluded studies are detailed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
<P>Following an assessment for inclusion, we assessed the methodology of the trial. The data were extracted onto hard copy data sheets. Caroline Smith, Carmel Collins and Allan Cyna extracted the data and assessed the quality. Two review authors assessed and extracted data for each trial.</P>
<P>Included trials were assessed according to the following five main criteria:<BR/>(1) adequate concealment of treatment allocation (for example, opaque, sealed, numbered envelopes); <BR/>(2) method of allocation to treatment (for example, by computer randomisation, random-number tables); <BR/>(3) adequate documentation of how exclusions were handled after treatment allocation - to facilitate intention-to-treat analysis; and<BR/>(4) adequate blinding of outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Letters were used to indicate the quality of the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), for example:<BR/>(1) A was used to indicate a trial that had a high level of quality in which all the criteria were met; <BR/>(2) B was used to indicate that one or more criteria were partially met or it was unclear if all the criteria were met; and <BR/>(3) C was used if one or more criteria were not met. </P>
<P>We entered data directly from the published reports into the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) with double data entry performed by a co-author (Carmel Collins). Where data were not presented in a suitable format for data entry, or if data were missing, we sought additional information from the trialists by personal communication in the form of a letter or email. </P>
<P>Due to the nature of the interventions, double blinding of assessments may not be possible. Therefore, studies without double blinding of assessments were considered for inclusion. Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis was performed if possible). Where data were missing, we sought clarification from the original authors. Statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) software. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We calculated weighted mean difference and 95% CIs for continuous data. </P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that losses to follow up greater than 25% would be excluded from the analysis. Postpublication, we have changed this to include a sensitivity analysis. This was undertaken on trials excluding those with a loss to follow up of 25% or greater. We tested for heterogeneity between trials using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Where significant heterogeneity was present (greater than 50%), we used a random-effects model. No trials reported outcomes by parity and therefore no subgroup analyses by parity were undertaken. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acupressure</HEADING>
<P>Two trials of acupressure were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial undertaken by <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2003</LINK> was carried out in Taiwan between May and September 2001. One hundred and twenty-seven women were randomised to three groups: acupressure, effleurage and a control group. Women had gone into spontaneous labour and were in the first stage of labour. The acupressure intervention was administered by five midwives trained in the technique. The acupressure intervention lasted 20 minutes, consisting of five minute pressure to points LI4 and BL67. Five cycles of acupressure were completed in five minutes, with each cycle comprising 10 seconds of sustained pressure and two seconds of rest without pressure. Outcomes reported included the frequency and intensity of contractions and intensity of labour pain.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK> reported on the trial undertaken in Soul, Korea. Eighty-nine women were randomised to acupressure or touch applied to point Spleen 6 (SP6). The control group received touch without pressure at point SP6. Pressure was applied in the treatment group. For both groups the intervention was administered over 30 minutes during each uterine contraction. Deep breathing and relaxation were also utilised. The trial reported on use of pain relief, anxiety levels, and duration of labour.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials of acupuncture were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Nesheim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nesheim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramnero-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramnero 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skilnand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skilnand 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Skilnand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skilnand 2002</LINK> randomised 210 women giving birth at a maternity ward in Norway. Women were randomised to receive acupuncture or sham/minimal acupuncture. All women had access to conventional analgesics if insufficient pain relief was provided by the study interventions. A selection of acupuncture points were chosen from 17 points; needles were removed after 20 minutes or taped and retained until birth, or if conventional medication was required. The control group involved minimal acupuncture involving the insertion of needles away from the meridians. The trial reported on pain relief, use of analgesics and use of oxytocin.</P>
<P>A trial of 198 women randomised to receive acupuncture or standard care was undertaken in Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Nesheim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nesheim 2003</LINK>). The selection of acupuncture points and mode of stimulation was individualised. Outcome measures reported use of analgesics, mode of birth, length of labour and Apgar score.</P>
<P>In the Swedish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ramnero-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramnero 2002</LINK>), 100 women were randomised to receive acupuncture or no acupuncture. All women in the trial received routine midwifery care and had access to all conventional analgesia. The acupuncture treatment was individualised. Needles were left in situ between one and three hours. Ninety women were included in the analysis after ten women were excluded due to the inclusion criteria not being met. Outcomes were reported describing pain, relaxation, use of analgesics, augmentation of labour with oxytocin, duration of labour, outcome of birth, antepartum haemorrhage, Apgar scores and infant birthweight.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Aromatherapy</HEADING>
<P>One trial of aromatherapy was included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Calvert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 2000</LINK>). In this New Zealand study, 22 multiparous women with a singleton pregnancy were randomised in a double-blind trial to receive essential oil of ginger or essential oil of lemongrass in the bath. Women were required to bathe for at least one hour. All women received routine care and had access to pain relief. The trial reported on frequency of contractions, cervical dilatation, length of first and second stage of labour, need for pain relief, side-effects from essential oils, Apgar scores and direct rooming-in.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Audio-analgesia</HEADING>
<P>One trial of audio-analgesia was included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1965</LINK>). The trial undertaken in England, recruited 25 women; 24 women completed the trial. Women were randomised to receive audio-analgesia which consisted of 'sea noise' white sound set at 120 decibels, or to the control group who received 'sea noise' at a maximum 90 decibels. The intervention began when women were in the first stage of labour. All women received routine care and the midwife offered the woman pain relief if she considered pain relief was inadequate. The trial reported on the midwife's perception of pain relief and the woman's satisfaction with pain relief from 'sea noise'.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1986</LINK>
<BR/>Eighty-two primigravida women were randomised to self-hypnosis or a control group at an antenatal clinic in England. The trial examined the effect of hypnosis on the duration of pregnancy and labour, analgesic requirements and mode of birth. Women attended weekly hypnosis sessions from 32 weeks; the control was standard care. Seventeen women (20.7%) were excluded from subsequent analysis by the authors due to pre-eclampsia (one); breech presentation (three); delivery by caesarean section (nine) and failure to attend hypnosis sessions (four).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK>
<BR/>After determining hypnotic susceptibility, 60 nulliparous women at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy were recruited from an obstetric private practice in the United States. Women were randomised to self-hypnosis or a control group involving standard relaxation, distraction, and breathing techniques. Treatment was conducted over six one-hour, weekly sessions. Women participated in groups of 15. The control group listened to their tape at the beginning of each treatment session. These women were asked to concentrate on their breathing exercises, general relaxation, and focal point visualisation. Women in the hypnosis group heard the live hypnotic induction during session one and heard the taped hypnotic induction at the start of sessions two to six. Women rated the type and degree of pain experienced during childbirth, and obstetric outcomes were collected on length of first and second stage of labour, Apgar scores, and use of medication. Psychological assessment involved use of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Form R antenatally and postnatally within 72 hours of delivery.</P>

<P>Eighty-three women were recruited from a regional hospital in Taiwan between 1999 and 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>). Women were between 37 and 42 weeks' pregnant, with a normal pregnancy, the partner was expected to be present during labour and cervical dilatation was no more than 4 cm. The primary researcher gave the massage during uterine contractions and taught the method to the woman's partner. Women received directional firm rhythmic massage lasting 30 minutes and comprised of effleurage, sacral pressure and shoulder and back kneading. Participants were encouraged to select their preferred technique. The 30-minute massage was repeated in phase two and in the transitional phase three. The control group received standard nursing care and 30 minutes of the researchers attendance and casual conversation. The outcomes measured pain, anxiety, and an assessment of satisfaction with the childbirth experience.</P>

<P>One trial reported on maternal satisfaction with pain relief (65 women) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1986</LINK>). Women in the hypnosis group reported greater satisfaction than those in the control group (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.71 (125 women)). In the <LINK REF="STD-Rock-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1969</LINK> trial, women reported their experience as less painful (P &lt; 0.01) although no data were presented. In addition, no women reported postnatal depression during their follow-up visit. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mehl_x002d_Madrona--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mehl-Madrona 2004</LINK> trial, anxiety and depression scale data were presented according to whether the birth was complicated or uncomplicated as defined by the author. The <LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK> trial found no overall difference in measures of depression using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory between women in the hypnosis and control groups (WMD-2.7, 95% CI -7.82 to 2.42).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Need for pain relief</HEADING>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic indicated significant heterogeneity; using a random-effects model, the meta-analysis for the five trials reporting on this outcome showed a decreased need for pharmacological pain relief in women allocated to the hypnosis groups compared to the control groups (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79 (727 women)).</P>
<P>All five trials reported on the use of pharmacological pain relief in labour. In the <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1986</LINK>, there was no difference in the use of pain relief between women receiving hypnosis and the control group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.82, (65 women)), although women rated to have a good or moderate response to hypnosis had relatively fewer epidurals than those rated to have a poor responsive (4/24 versus 4/5, P &lt; 0.05). In the <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2001</LINK> trial, women receiving hypnosis used less anaesthesia than women in the control group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11 (42 women)). <LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK> reported on the use of narcotics; fewer women in the hypnosis group used narcotics than in the control group (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.55, (60 women)). <LINK REF="STD-Mehl_x002d_Madrona--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mehl-Madrona 2004</LINK> reported women receiving hypnosis required less pharmacological pain relief (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.52) and less use of epidural analgesia (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.40 (520 women). In the <LINK REF="STD-Rock-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1969</LINK> trial, there was a reduced incidence in the use of pain relief in those women allocated to the hypnosis intervention when compared with the control (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94).</P>

<P>Two trials reported on the use of augmentation with oxytocin (<LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2001</LINK>) and one trial combined augmentation with induction in the trial report. On contacting the author, additional information regarding these outcomes has been provided (<LINK REF="STD-Mehl_x002d_Madrona--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mehl-Madrona 2004</LINK>). Women in the hypnosis groups used less oxytocin than women in the control groups (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.45 (622 women)) and women are reported by <LINK REF="STD-Mehl_x002d_Madrona--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mehl-Madrona 2004</LINK> as less likely to require an induction of labour with hypnosis preparation for childbirth versus control (RR 0.34 95% CI 0.18 to 0.65 (520 women)).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1986</LINK> reported a longer mean duration of labour in the hypnosis group than in the control group (12.4 versus 9.7 hours, P &lt; 0.05) while <LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK> found the duration of the first stage of labour in the hypnosis group to be significantly shorter (P &lt; 0.001) than the control group by over two hours. This was the only study that defined the duration of labour (as time from 5 cm to full dilatation).</P>
<P>Limited neonatal outcomes were reported in three trials.

Apgar scores at five minutes were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Harmon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harmon 1990</LINK>; mean score for the hypnosis group was 9.30 (standard deviation (SD) 0.65) and the control group was 8.7 (SD 0.50). There was no difference seen in neonatal resuscitation between groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Mehl_x002d_Madrona--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mehl-Madrona 2004</LINK> trial (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96).</P>

There was a difference in women's anxiety in the first phase of labour, with women in the massage group reporting less anxiety (-16.27, 95% CI -27.25 to -5.28, P &lt; 0.05). No difference in the duration of labour was found (WMD 1.35, 95% CI -0.98 to 3.68) and satisfaction with general birth experience (WMD -0.47, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.13).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-02 21:38:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the increasing use of complementary therapies there is a lack of well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of many of these therapies for pain management in labour. Few complementary therapies have been subjected to rigorous scientific study and, with the exception of acupuncture and hypnosis, the number of women studied in this setting is small. Most trials were small and of poor methodological quality or inadequately reported. The insufficient reporting made the assessment of methodological quality and data extraction difficult. The heterogeneity reported for the hypnosis and acupuncture trials may be explained by variation in the design of the treatment interventions including techniques and the duration of the intervention. Overall, the clinical implications of the studies are limited by the inclusion of few clinical outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acupressure</HEADING>
<P>There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of acupressure on pain management and further research is required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from the three trials included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Nesheim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nesheim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramnero-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramnero 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skilnand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skilnand 2002</LINK>) suggest women receiving acupuncture required less analgesia, including the need for epidural analgesic. The results also suggest a reduced need for augmentation with oxytocin. Further research is required. Appropriately powered randomised trials are required to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture on the clinical outcomes described in this review.</P>
<P>The three trials of acupuncture represent different approaches to the use of acupuncture to manage pain during labour. In addition to the style of acupuncture used, acupuncture can vary in the selection of acupuncture points and the needling techniques used (duration of needling, number of points used, depth of needling, type of stimulation and point selection). It is important that any future clinical trials of acupuncture for pain management in labour report the basis for the acupuncture treatment and needling as described in the STRICTA guideline (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aromatherapy</HEADING>
<P>There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of aromatherapy on pain management in labour on any primary or secondary outcome from one small controlled trial comparing lemongrass and ginger. A methodological issue for trials of aromatherapy is the choice of an appropriate control group to ensure participants and care providers remain unaware of the group allocation and the use of a control group enabling meaningful comparisons to be made. Adequately powered studies are needed to examine the effects of aromatherapy on pain management in labour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Audio-analgesia</HEADING>
<P>There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of audio analgesia on pain management in labour. Further research is required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hypnosis</HEADING>
<P>Current available evidence shows that hypnosis reduces the need for pharmacological pain relief, including epidural analgesia in labour. Maternal satisfaction with pain management in labour may be greater among women using hypnosis. Other promising benefits from hypnosis appear to be an increased incidence of vaginal birth, and a reduced use of oxytocin augmentation. There was no evidence of any adverse effects on the mother or neonate. Potentially, medical hypnosis could be used alone for pain relief as part of a woman's care during childbirth. In practice, however, hypnosis may be best seen as an adjunct to facilitate and enhance other analgesics.</P>
<P>Overall, currently available data suggest that hypnosis is effective as an adjunctive analgesic during labour and is associated with a decreased use of oxytocic augmentation and an increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth. Acupuncture also appears beneficial in the provision of pain management during labour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The data available suggest hypnosis reduces the need for pharmacological pain relief in labour, reduces the requirements for drugs to augment labour; and increases the incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth. Acupuncture may be a helpful therapy for pain management in labour. The efficacy of acupressure, aromatherapy, audio-analgesia, relaxation and massage have not been established. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of complementary therapies for pain management in labour are needed. Further randomised trials should be adequately powered and include clinically relevant outcomes such as those described in this review. There is a need for improving the quality and reporting of future trials. In particular, consideration should be given in the analysis and reporting on the person providing the intervention, for example, their training, length of experience and relationship to the woman. In addition, further research is required which include data measuring neonatal outcomes and the effects on analgesia requirements in institutions with and without an 'on demand' epidural service. A cost-benefit analysis should be incorporated into the design of future studies. </P>
<P>Investigation is required of the timing and specific aspects of hypnosis delivery such as: group versus individual training in hypnosis; use of an audio tape or compact disc on hypnosis versus live hypnosis; longer-term follow up for postnatal depression (at least four months) and anxiety; the relative effects of hypnosis administered before and after the third trimester. The design of future acupuncture trials should consider the consensus recommendations for optimal treatment, sham controls and blinding (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2001</LINK>). In addition, combinations of the beneficial therapies (acupuncture and hypnosis) should be considered for further study. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Double-blind, randomised controlled trial of aromatherapy. Computer-generated sequence and concealed by a coded number on the bottle. The women, care providers, outcome assessor and analyst were all blind to the woman's group allocation.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>22 multiparous women with a singleton pregnancy were randomised to the trial. Women were excluded with previous caesarean section, major medical complications, skin allergies, hypotension, previous vaginal surgery (excluding dilatation and curettage), not receiving continuity of midwifery care. Women were recruited during the antenatal period, at a level II hospital in New Zealand.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Randomisation occurred on the delivery suite prior to the woman entering the bath. Once the woman was in the bath, the seal on the bottle was broken and the oil poured into the bath. The woman was required to remain in the bath for at least one hour. The experimental group received essential oil of ginger and the control group received essential oil of lemon grass.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Frequency of contractions, cervical dilatation, length of first and second stage of labour, pain experience, need for pain relief, side-effects from essential oils, Apgar scores, and rooming-in.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single-blind, randomised controlled trial of massage versus no treatment. Randomisation was alternate.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>83 women were recruited from a regional hospital in Taiwan between 1999-2000. Women were between 37 and 42 weeks' pregnant, with a normal pregnancy, the partner was expected to be present during labour and cervical dilatation was no more than 4 cm.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The primary researcher gave the massage during uterine contractions and taught the method to the woman's partner. Women received directional firm rhythmic massage lasting 30 minutes and comprised of effleurage, sacral pressure and shoulder and back kneading. Women were encouraged to selected their preferred technique. The 30-minute massage was repeated in phase 2 and in the transitional phase 3. The control group received standard nursing care and 30 minutes of the researchers attendance and casual conversation.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single-blind, randomised controlled trial of acupressure, effleurage and a control group. The randomisation allocation sequence was by coin tossing, participants were sequentially numbered but the allocation sequence was unclear. It was not feasible for the participant and therapist to be blind to their group allocation. The outcome assessors were blind to women's group allocation but unclear for analyst.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>127 women participated in the trial, during their first stage of labour. Participants needed to be between 37 and 42 weeks' pregnant, a low-risk pregnancy, singleton pregnancy and able to speak Chinese. Women who were induced with oxytocin, or received an epidural block or who planned a caesarean section were excluded from the study. The trial was undertaken in Taiwan, no other details were reported.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trained midwives administered the acupressure to women. The intervention lasted 20 minutes, consisting of 5 minutes pressure to points LI4 and BL67. Five cycles of acupressure were completed in 5 minutes, with each cycle comprising 10 seconds of sustained pressure and 2 seconds of rest without pressure. A protocol was established to control finger pressure, accuracy of points and accuracy of technique. For the effleurage group, the left and right upper arms were massaged for 10 minutes. In the control group, the midwife stayed with the participant for 20 minutes, taking notes or talking with the participant or family members.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>A VAS scale was used to measure the intensity of labour pain. This was administered before and after the intervention. Qualitative data were also collected on women's experience of labour pain 1-2 hours after delivery. The frequency and intensity of uterine contractions were measured from electronic fetal monitors.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
