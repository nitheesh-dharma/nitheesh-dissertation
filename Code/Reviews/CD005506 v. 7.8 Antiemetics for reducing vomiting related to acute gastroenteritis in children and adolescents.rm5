<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-19 11:15:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vomiting caused by acute gastroenteritis is very common in children and adolescents. Treatment of vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis can be problematic and there is lack of agreement among clinicians on the indications for the use of antiemetics. There have also been concerns expressed about apparently unacceptable levels of side effects with some of the older generation of antiemetics. The small number of included trials provided evidence which appeared to favour the use of antiemetics over placebo to reduce the number of episodes of vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children. A single oral dose of ondansetron given to children with mild to moderate dehydration can control vomiting, avoid hospitalization and intravenous fluid administration which would otherwise be needed. There were no major side effects other than a few reports of increased frequency of diarrhea.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-20 11:37:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials involving 1,020 participants. Mean time to cessation of vomiting in one study was 0.34 days less with dimenhydrinate suppository compared to placebo (P value = 0.036). Pooled data from three studies comparing oral ondansetron with placebo showed: a reduction in the immediate hospital admission rate (RR 0.40, NNT 17, 95% CI 10 to 100) but no difference between the hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge from the Emergency Department (ED); a reduction in IV rehydration rates both during the ED stay (RR 0.41, NNT 5, 95% CI 4 to 8), and in follow-up to 72 hours after discharge from the ED stay (worst-best scenario for ondansetron RR 0.57, NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 13) and an increase in the proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting (RR 1.34, NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 7)). No significant difference was noted in the revisit rates or adverse events, although diarrhea was reported as a side effect in four of the five ondansetron studies. In one study the proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting in 24 hours was (58%) with IV ondansetron, (17%) placebo and (33%) in the metoclopramide group (P value = 0.039).</P>

<P>Oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing intravenous rehydration and immediate hospital admission. Intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide reduced the number of episodes of vomiting and hospital admission, and dimenhydrinate as a suppository reduced the duration of vomiting.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Acute gastroenteritis is the leading cause of vomiting in children under three years of age and is a very common reason for children and adolescents attending emergency departments. Although vomiting is a fairly frequent occurrence in the younger child, it tends to be less prevalent in older children (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>). Vomiting is usually accompanied by diarrhea, and each year in the United States more than 200,000 children aged less than five years require admission for treatment of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis (<LINK REF="REF-Herikstad-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herikstad 2002</LINK>). There is a similar pattern in the UK, with acute gastroenteritis in children under five years accounting for 20% of general practitioner consultations and resulting in 24,000 hospital admissions annually (<LINK REF="REF-Flake-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flake 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Vomiting is usually defined as a violent expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth. The act of vomiting requires the coordinated contractions of the abdominal muscles, coupled with a diminished esophageal sphincter pressure and esophageal dilatation, with the stomach itself playing a somewhat passive role.</P>
<P>Dehydration, which is the decrease in total body water through a reduction in both the intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes, is an important cause of morbidity in children with vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-AAP1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP1996</LINK>). The clinical manifestations of dehydration are closely related to intravascular volume depletion, which may lead to complications including irreversible shock, intractable seizures and renal failure.</P>
<P>Starvation caused by reduced caloric intake in children with vomiting can lead to ketonemia, which in turn may lead to further dehydration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Gastroenteritis attributable to viruses or bacteria occurs in the UK at a rate of 1.2 infections per person per year and is most common in the autumn and winter (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>). The incidence in other developed countries is likely to be similar but may possibly be even higher in developing countries. The rotavirus, calcivirus, astrovirus, reoviruses and adenoviruses are most commonly implicated. Bacterial causes may include <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, <I>Salmonella</I>, <I>Bacillus cereus</I>, or <I>Clostridium perfringens</I>. However, in developing countries, the rotavirus remains the most common cause of vomiting in children under three years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Doan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doan 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Intestinal irritation caused by gastroenteritis appears to be the main stimulus for vomiting. As the virus invades the mucosal cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract, it disrupts the normal sodium and osmotic intracellular balance and intracellular fluids are lost, producing cellular fluid depletion. Paralysis of the bowel develops with resultant abdominal distension, which induces further vomiting.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Vomiting, from whatever cause, occurs because of the stimulation of the two centers located in the brain, the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the vomiting center. The vomiting center, which controls and integrates the act of vomiting, is located close to other centers which regulate respiration, vasomotor and other autonomic functions, and that may play an additional role in vomiting.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Stimuli are received by the vomiting centre from the gastrointestinal tract, from other parts of the body and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1989</LINK>). In turn, the vomiting centre stimulates the salivation center, respiratory center and the pharyngeal, gastro-intestinal and abdominal muscles, which then leads to vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) may receive stimuli from bacterial toxins or from metabolic abnormalities that occur with uremia, but it cannot independently mediate the act of vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 1996</LINK>). Instead impulses from the CTZ are relayed to the vomiting center, which coordinates the various physiological functions involved in vomiting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-16 22:16:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vomiting associated with acute gastroenteritis is a distressing symptom for children and their parents. When faced with distraught parents, pediatricians may find themselves compelled to administer medication to stop children from vomiting. Treatment of vomiting in children is a controversial issue. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in its position statement on the management of acute gastroenteritis in young children that it did not specifically evaluate the use of antiemetic drugs, it did confirm that there was a consensus of opinion that antiemetic drugs are not recommended and that physicians should be aware of their potential side effects (<LINK REF="REF-AAP1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP1996</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Antiemetic medications are known to alleviate vomiting by inhibiting the body's chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) or by a more direct action on the brain's vomiting centre.</P>
<P>A wide range of medicines in oral and intravenous format have been used as antiemetics in children. These medications include: dopamine (D2) antagonists, serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) antagonists, anticholinergic agents, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, and cannabinoids (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 1996</LINK>). Promethazine was the most  commonly prescribed antiemetic agent for children, with metoclopramide  and prochlorperazine prescribed less frequently because of important side effects such as sedation and extra pyramidal reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>). 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists, such as ondansetron, are a class of antiemetic drugs that have few adverse effects and that have been safely used in children. Choosing between these therapeutic agents involves the careful consideration of a number of factors, including their effectiveness, their side effect profiles and cost.<BR/>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-19 11:19:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physicians who provide care to paediatric patients in the emergency department (ED) usually prescribe intravenous fluid therapy (IVT) for mild or moderate dehydration when vomiting is the major symptom. Additional symptomatic treatment of vomiting with antiemetics could lead to an important reduction in the use of intravenous rehydration as well as hospitalization, and a resumption of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Concerns have also been expressed about the side effects of some antiemetics.</P>
<P>A number of randomized control trials have investigated the effectiveness of different antiemetics, some of which have been assessed in several recent non-Cochrane systematic reviews.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants and setting</HEADING>
<P>Six of the trials were conducted in the emergency departments of children's hospitals in the USA, Canada, Turkey and Venezuela; the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>) was carried out in Germany and enrolled children from six pediatric practices.The age of the participants ranged from five months to 12 years and the inclusion criteria for enrolment were similar for all seven studies.</P>
<P>The trials were conducted over different time periods. In the <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK> study, the children were discharged to home care after the initial observation period in the emergency department and were followed up for up to 48 hours, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> study was completed in 24 hours, after which all the participants were discharged and received no further care. In <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> discharge was dependent on oral rehydration levels and daily follow-up continued until symptoms had resolved. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> were only followed up on days three and seven after randomization. In <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK> participants who were able to tolerate oral hydration were discharged from the emergency department and followed up over a 72-hour period; only those unable to tolerate oral hydration continued to receive IV therapy and were re-evaluated at four-hourly intervals. Follow-up and assessment in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> was at 18 to 24 hours and seven to 14 days after enrolment.</P>
<P>The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> were kept under observation in hospital for an eight-hour period; if they became dehydrated, refused oral rehydration, had excessive vomiting or failed to gain weight during this time, they were admitted and the study protocol was discontinued. Participants who had been discharged were followed up by telephone interview within 16 hours.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> study, a diagnosis of either bacterial or viral gastroenteritis was confirmed by stool analysis, whereas the diagnosis in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> was less clear, with a clinical definition of gastroenteritis described as "the presence of vomiting with or without diarrhea". The cause of gastroenteritis was not investigated in the <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> study but "all children with symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis" were considered eligible for screening. A diagnosis of acute gastritis or gastroenteritis determined by the pediatric emergency physician was a pre-requisite for enrolment in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> comprised children with "suspected infectious gastroenteritis" but those with moderate to severe gastroenteritis were excluded from the study.

Dexamethasone, ondansetron or placebo (normal saline) was infused intravenously over a 10-minute period in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>. A single oral dose of ondansetron was administered in <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>, while in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK> participants received six doses over 48 hours and in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> three oral doses were administered over 24 hours. In <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> a suppository of dimenhydrinate or placebo was administered in the emergency department and the caregivers were instructed to administer further suppositories (weight-dependent up to a maximum of three), only if there was persistent vomiting or excretion of the suppository after insertion.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> intensive ORT was instituted one hour after the intervention and discharge was at the discretion of the treating physician. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> underwent an oral challenge 30 minutes after the intervention and if they failed this, they then received intravenous rehydration; powdered oral rehydration solution together, with instructions on how it should be used was provided for home care in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> oral rehydration therapy was started 30 minutes after the intervention and the success of ORT was re-evaluated periodically.</P>
<P>All of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> were hospitalized for a minimum of 24 hours; they were orally rehydrated and none received any intravenous fluids. In all of the studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK>, if any of the participants failed oral rehydration or continued to vomit, they were admitted and intravenous rehydration was instituted. All of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK> received intravenous rehydration therapy of 0.9% sodium chloride solution as part of the study protocol; discharge was based on the ability to tolerate oral rehydration, but no details were reported about the type of ORT.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment failures</HEADING>

Participants in all of the studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK>, who received intravenous rehydration or were admitted were considered treatment failures and took no further part in the study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> study, participants who received insufficient oral rehydration were admitted to the emergency department observation unit but continued with the study. The protocol was only discontinued and the participant admitted to the ward if vomiting occurred more than three times, if oral intake was refused three times consecutively or if there was weight loss at the end of the first eight-hour period. It was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> if participants who were hospitalized or lost to follow-up at 18-24 hours were considered treatment failures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome for this review, the time taken from the first administration of the treatment measure until cessation of vomiting, was reported in only one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>). All of the remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK>) partially addressed our secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Data for the secondary outcomes of rates of rehydration either oral and/or intravenous and hospitalization were reported in six of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK>). While hospitalization of all the participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> study ensured they were more closely observed and that data collection was more likely to be complete, greater reliance was placed on the participants and their carers in the remaining studies. Thus in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK>, the carers were asked to complete a diary recording the number of episodes of vomiting in the 24-hour follow-up period and, although they were contacted by telephone 24 and 48 hours after discharge, compliance with medication, oral rehydration and the BRAT diet guidelines could not be assured. The completed diaries were to be mailed by the carers to the investigators, which would enable them to confirm the data which had previously been obtained over the telephone, but losses to telephone follow-up and mail-in diary amounted to 10% to 15% of participants in this study.</P>
<P>The carers in the <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> study were interviewed on the third and seventh day by a research assistant and asked whether the child had returned to the emergency department, had been admitted to hospital or had received intravenous rehydration. In <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>, revisits by participants were recorded up to 72 hours following discharge in addition to the number of participants who were subsequently admitted to hospital or had received intravenous rehydration.</P>
<P>Standardized daily symptom diaries were provided for parents or guardians of all of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> and follow-up consisted of daily telephone interviews until symptoms had resolved. These symptom diaries and telephone interviews recorded the number of episodes of vomiting per day. However only 10% of the symptom diaries were returned, whereas 94% (ondansetron group) and 88% (placebo group) of the carers participated in the telephone interviews. In <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK>, the participants' carers were contacted over the 24-hour period following discharge and questioned about the "general condition of the patient", which included the number of episodes of emesis, timing of administration of study medication and whether there had been any side effects to the intervention. A follow-up assessment was scheduled for 18 to 24 hours after randomization in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK>, and this was followed by a telephone interview seven to 14 days after enrolment which enquired about the time to cessation of vomiting and parental satisfaction with treatment success, which was rated on a scale: 1 = best, 6 = worst.</P>
<P>Parental satisfaction with "the medicine their child received" was evaluated, by telephone interview, in <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> but no data were reported by the investigators.</P>

The Ginsburg study was a non-randomized controlled trial and it was withdrawn from further review (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsburg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsburg 1980</LINK>).

<P>We translated the Debray trial from the French into the English language and then assessed it against the inclusion criteria specified for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Debray-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Debray 1990</LINK>). The participants in this trial included children and infants vomiting from either bacterial or viral infectious diseases, of which less than half (49%) had vomiting attributable to gastroenteritis, whereas the remaining participants were vomiting due to bronchitis or 'other'. As more than half of the participants in this study were not suffering with gastroenteritis and the authors did not report separate data for those children with vomiting induced by gastroenteritis, this study is awaiting further assessment. We have written to the authors to try to obtain the missing data and, on the basis of any additional information we receive, will update this review accordingly.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria in our protocol specified that the participants should be children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. Although the mean age of participants in the Reeves trial was 5.3 years, this trial did include patients up to the age of 22 years, which we considered neither children nor adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Reeves-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Reeves 2002</LINK>). As it was not clear from the text how many of the participants were over the age of 18 years, we have written to the trialists asking for clarification as to how many of the participants fall outside our inclusion criteria of 18 years of age. This trial is awaiting further assessment pending a reply from the trialists.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomization</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK>, the investigators stated that the participants were randomly assigned to interventions and control, but the method used to achieve randomization was not explicit; thus we have judged this domain as 'unclear risk of bias'. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> were randomized in blocks of six and an "independent statistician provided the code to the pharmacy", thus sequence generation was assessed as 'low risk of bias'. The investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> stated that they randomized the participants in blocks of 10, and the report also included a Trial flow chart which referred to "Block Randomization.com", an Internet-based randomization generator. We therefore judged this domain as 'low risk of bias'. In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK>, the method used to randomize participants was described as "using standard random number allocation tables" and thus we have judged it as 'low risk of bias'.</P>
<P>We judged sequence generation in the remaining three studies as 'low risk of bias'. Central randomization was carried out by the pharmacy using a table of random numbers in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>. Block randomization in blocks of four and stratified by body weight was used in <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> and randomization was in blocks of six in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>The methods used to generate the allocation sequence and how the sequence was concealed, such that participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee the upcoming assignment, are the most important and sensitive indicators that bias has been minimized in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The allocation sequence was considered to have been adequately concealed by the investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK>, who stated that the randomization code was locked away and was only broken and revealed to the assessors at the conclusion of the trial. It was also clearly described in <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> as the "study medication was prepared by a pharmacist not involved in patient care". In <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK>, the pharmacy code was provided by an independent statistician and the weight-appropriate intervention was placed in an opaque bag. Central randomization in the pharmacy ensured adequate concealment of the allocation sequence in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK>, and in both <LINK REF="STD-Uhlig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uhlig 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> the randomization lists were prepared independently by statisticians not involved with the study. We made a judgment of 'low risk of bias' for this domain in all six of these studies, but in <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK> it was unclear if adequate measures were taken to ensure that investigators were unaware of the upcoming assignment.

<P>Although the investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> reported that the study medication was prepared by an independent pharmacist, they were not explicit as to whether persons assessing the outcomes of care were blinded to which treatment the participants received, and thus we graded this domain as 'unclear risk of bias'. Blinding of participants, healthcare providers and outcomes assessors was adequately described in <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK> and was judged as 'low risk of bias'. In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK> "the pharmacy provided the drug or a color, taste, and odor-matched placebo in identical packaging.." and the " code remained locked within the pharmacy research section and was broken and revealed to the investigators only at the close of the study".

The investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 2006</LINK> conceded that their study was "hampered by a large amount of missing data from subjects who were lost to follow-up after two to four hours", which was their a priori<I> </I>primary endpoint.</P>
<P>All of the studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1997</LINK> provided flow diagrams charting the path of participants through each study, but losses to follow-up, treatment failures and protocol violators were still variably reported.

<P>Data analysis in most of the studies was reported to have followed the intention-to-treat principle (ITT), even though in some instances it was fairly clear that a per-protocol analysis had been carried out (see Chapter 16.2 <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK> it was reported that 2/74 participants in the ondansetron and 11/71 in the placebo group who had persistent vomiting, or refused oral rehydration, or were administered intravenous fluids were subsequently admitted (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>, 3/51 participants in the ondansetron group were admitted, of which two were unable to tolerate the oral challenge and one was subsequently diagnosed with a brain tumour.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2010</LINK> the number of participants admitted during the 24 hours following the eight-hour ED observation period was 2/55 in the ondansetron group and 10/54 in the placebo group (See <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pooled data for the admission rate across the studies are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsook 2002</LINK>, four participants who were randomized to ondansetron revisited, but the report was unclear and we were unable to confirm with the investigators if these had previously been hospitalized, or were hospitalized on their re-visit.

<P>The AAP guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-AAP1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP1996</LINK>), published almost 10 years ago, stated that there was a consensus of opinion that antiemetics were not needed for the management of vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children. The AAP guidelines did also warn that clinicians should be aware of certain potential, but unspecified, adverse effects associated with antiemetics, yet these studies, whilst reporting some side effects, appeared to indicate that other than diarrhoea, all of the drugs were reasonably well tolerated.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations in study design and implementation</HEADING>
<P>Although study design in the included studies appeared to have been adequate overall, our study-level assessments of the risk of bias for a number of the domains in several of these studies revealed some of the limitations in their implementation, which have been reported in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>' section of this review.</P>
<P>Even though we were successful in contacting the investigators in a number of the included studies, the disposition of some of the participants remains unclear. Whilst these inconsistencies are more likely to be as a result of systematic error and most probably associated with the rolling recruitment of participants and the challenges faced in the follow-up of pediatric participants, they do not necessarily indicate any intentional subversion of the trials. In two of the studies, false inclusions were excluded from an ITT analysis. It is considered that this may have occurred as a result of poor screening methodology applied in a busy hospital environment, and thus the entry criteria were not applied consistently across study participants.</P>
<P>However, whilst recognizing these limitations, the authors consider that the body of evidence summarized in this review is sufficient to allow certain conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the interventions used in the treatment of vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indirectness of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>All of the included studies matched the eligibility criteria for this review, but the majority of participants enrolled in these studies were suffering from mild to moderate acute gastroenteritis, and six of the studies were conducted in the emergency departments of hospitals as opposed to only one in an outpatient pediatric practice setting. The potential impact of these factors on the generalizability and external validity of the evidence provided in this review needs to be considered by clinicians when extrapolating it into clinical decision-making. The use of placebo as the comparator in most of the studies would not readily facilitate future assessments on the advantages or disadvantages of newer to existing interventions. To fill the evidence, gap clinicians need to have access to not only the risk and benefits of individual interventions, but also the relative efficacy of these interventions and thus head-to-head trials are more likely to have provided evidence that is both relevant and direct.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results</HEADING>
<P>Studies identified for inclusion in this systematic review considered a relatively narrow range of interventions, and the results for specific outcomes were fairly consistent across the limited number of studies and interventions where pooling of data was feasible. However, in one of these studies we were unable to clearly determine if four of the participants had either been admitted to hospital or had received IV rehydration therapy. In view of the uncertain status of these participants, we carried out best-worst and worst-best case scenario sensitivity analyses and found that the hospital admission outcome was sensitive to the missing data. More precisely, whilst the best-worst case scenario offered limited data to suggest ondansetron may reduce the rate of admission (up to 72 hours after discharge from ED stay) (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 49%), the worst-best scenario indicated that it was unlikely that ondansetron reduced the hospital admission rate (I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic<SUP> </SUP>= 0%). After taking into consideration the degree of heterogeneity in the two scenarios, the worst-best case scenario would be more typical and therefore it would appear less likely that ondansetron reduces the hospital admission rate (up to 72 hours after discharge from ED stay)<B>. </B>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Imprecision of results</HEADING>
<P>The paucity of studies (although they were of adequate sample size and duration, and examined similar interventions) that were included in this review provided limited amounts of data which could be pooled and therefore any substantive assessment of the degree of precision of effect was not feasible. We have exercised caution when extracting data from the primary research studies and have provided confidence intervals to indicate the strength of the data on which conclusions might be drawn. We have reported uncertainty in conjunction with 95% CIs and have presented the impact of a minimal set of missing observations on the 95% CIs and on the conclusions which we have highlighted within <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-22 09:23:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin Dearness">
<P>The update of this Cochrane review, together with the additional trials, complements two recent non-Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Colletti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colletti 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK>) and contributes further to the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of antiemetics for vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children.</P>
<P>One of these reviews (<LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK>) has been assessed and reported as a reliable and valid source of evidence on the use of antiemetics for vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in the child and adolescent (<LINK REF="REF-Vreeman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vreeman 2008</LINK>). The review authors identified 11 eligible studies; used a check list (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>) to assign a quality score to each study; and indicated that they had carried out sensitivity analyses on the basis of quality; however the details of these analyses were not reported.The authors also carried out meta-analyses on the basis of treatment and utilized a pragmatic approach in pooling data across different modes of administration and ages of participants. We question the validity of the decision by the review authors to pool some of these data in view of the apparent clinical diversity between the selected studies and most specifically in the differences in their routes of administration.</P>
<P>In this updated version we have assessed the risk of bias in each included study and, based on clarification sought and received from trial investigators, have amended some of the judgements in several of the domains accordingly. Additional data received from the investigators in (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>) has also allowed us to carry out ITT analyses as compared to the complete-case analysis used by the review authors in <LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The findings in this systematic review are to a large extent in agreement with those reported in <LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK>; however this review does also differ somewhat by considering two clinically important time-points: outcomes occurring during the ED stay and those up to 72 hours following discharge from the ED stay. Whilst these would appear to strengthen the conclusions relevant to the ED stay, questions still remain whether oral ondansetron does in fact reduce the hospital admission rate in the period up to 72 hours following discharge from the ED stay. Furthermore, although the review by <LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK> discusses the variability between studies in showing the effectiveness of ondansetron in reducing the admission rate, it also suggests a potential cost saving associated with a reduction in hospital admission and use of intravenous rehydration, an assumption unsupported by the somewhat inconclusive evidence reported in our review.</P>
<P>The literature review by <LINK REF="REF-Colletti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colletti 2009</LINK> evaluated studies published from 1966 to 2006, but provided very limited detail about any assessments of the methodological quality of the included studies, and reported the results and conclusions in a descriptive manner which added very little to the body of evidence.</P>

<P>Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of children with gastroenteritis recommend supportive care using oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for mild to moderate dehydration, but provide no recommendations on the additional use of antiemetic medication for vomiting. However, in practice it would appear that there is now an increased tendency towards the prescribing of antiemetic medication by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwon 2002</LINK>). Antiemetics such as promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide are known to have serious side effects, hence they are less commonly prescribed. This systematic review provides evidence which supports the use of ondansetron as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy in the treatment of children with acute gastroenteritis exhibiting mild to moderate dehydration.</P>
<P>Ondansetron given as a single dose (0.1 mg/kg) (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roslund-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roslund 2008</LINK>) orally, or intravenously in the emergency department to children with mild to moderate dehydration, appears to decrease the number of children who have persistent vomiting as a barrier to ORT. In addition, it decreases the number of children requiring intravenous rehydration and hospital admission, although it may not either reduce the chance of a revisit or admission after departure from the emergency department. Oral ondansetron may also prove to be useful as an adjunctive measure to ORT in the outpatient or home-care setting.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-18 22:06:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;In view of the likelihood of a higher incidence of gastroenteritis in developing countries the importance of further research into the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of antiemetics cannot be underestimated, particularly if this may lead to a reduction in the frequency with which costly intravenous fluids and hospitalization are required. However research is needed to compare the routes of administration &lt;b&gt;BC- THIS NEEDS TO BE HIGHLIGHTED, AT IV is EXPENSIVE and MASSIVELY INVASIVE BUT oral might be totally acceptable, but no one knows best! THIS IS CRITICAL FOR RESEARCH VJ DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD HERE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will require that future clinical trials and algorithms of care are not only based on outcome data but also on a formal cost effectiveness analysis value analysis of across treatments, routes of administration and follow-up regimens&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-07-18 22:06:09 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents provides an example of where there is evidence of a benefit of the intervention. This review shows that the question of the effects of antiemetics on children with vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis should now be considered as broadly answered. Further research may be justified to investigate the relative effects of different dosage regimes, different settings i.e. outpatient and home-based care; hydration status and severity of disease; and on outcomes that are of relevance to patients such as, for example, the time to cessation of vomiting from administration of antiemetic. This research should also include a formal cost effectiveness analysis across treatments, routes of administration and follow-up regimens, and be evaluated separately for developed and developing countries because clinical decision-making, patients' preferences and carer expectations of outcomes do differ across these variables.</P>
<P>Future randomized controlled trials must be well-designed, well-conducted, and adequately delivered with subsequent reporting, including high-quality descriptions of all aspects of methodology. Rigorous reporting needs to conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>) which will enable appraisal and interpretation of results, and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence. Although it is uncertain whether reported quality mirrors actual study conduct, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear methodology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Adherence to guidelines, such as the CONSORT statement, would help ensure complete reporting.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2011-07-22 09:23:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin Dearness">
<P>Several post hoc changes were made to the review. A further secondary outcome was added: mean number of episodes of vomiting and proportion of patients with reduction in vomiting. The expected positive effect of the intervention is to reduce emesis and this can be more directly addressed by this new outcome.</P>
<P>Changes were also made to the secondary outcomes to include hospitalization rates and intravenous rehydration rates at specific and clinically important time-points i.e. at discharge and up to 72 hours following discharge. Assessments of these outcomes at these time-points could help provide additional valuable decision-making information to clinicians on the effectiveness or otherwise of these interventions.</P>
<P>The methodology section of the review has been updated to incorporate the analyses that we have conducted in addition to a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of missing data on the robustness of our review results, such that these can then be compared with other published reviews.</P>

<P>Only one of the trials included in this systematic review addressed our primary outcome "the time taken from the first administration of treatment measure to cessation of vomiting", and therefore we report principally the outcomes presented in the seven included trials, which specifically relate to several of the secondary outcomes in the protocol of this review. Two trials are awaiting assessment and, if data relevant to the outcomes of this review become available, we will update the review accordingly.</P>
<P>The review was updated in 2009. At this update, the section '<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>' was modified to comply with changes in RevMan 5.0 software and the publication of <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>.</P>
