<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:25:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some patients who undergo surgery require blood transfusions to compensate for the blood loss that occurs during the procedure. Often the blood used for the transfusion has been donated by a volunteer. The risks associated with receiving volunteer donor blood that has been screened by a competently managed modern laboratory are considered minimal, with the risk of contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C being extremely low. However there is concern in many developing countries, where there is a high prevalence of such infections and transfusion services are inadequately equipped to screen donor blood as thoroughly. Although in developed countries the risks of acquiring a disease from transfused blood are low, the financial costs associated with providing a safe and reliable blood product are escalating. Therefore there is much attention being placed on alternative strategies to minimise the need for transfusions of donor blood.</P>
<P>'Cell salvage' or 'autotransfusion' is one technique designed to reduce the use of such transfusions. It involves the collection of a patient's own blood from surgical sites which can be transfused back into the same person during or after surgery, as required.</P>
<P>The authors undertook this systematic review to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of cell salvage in reducing the need for blood transfusions of donor blood in adults (over 18 years) undergoing surgery.</P>
<P>The authors found 75 studies investigating the effectiveness of cell salvage in orthopaedic (36 studies), cardiac (33 studies), and vascular (6 studies) surgery. Overall, the findings show that cell salvage reduces the need for transfusions of donated blood. The authors conclude that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the use of cell salvage in cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. Cell salvage does not appear to cause any adverse clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>As the methodological quality of the trials was poor, the findings may be biased in favour of cell salvage. Large trials of high methodological quality that assess the relative effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of cell salvage in different surgical procedures should be the focus of future research in this area.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:18:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials with a concurrent control group in which adult patients, scheduled for non-urgent surgery, were randomised to cell salvage (autotransfusion) or to a control group who did not receive the intervention.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:19:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were independently extracted and the risk of bias assessed. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:37:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 75 trials were included. Overall, the use of cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 38% (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70). The absolute reduction in risk (ARR) of receiving an allogeneic RBC transfusion was 21% (95% CI 15% to 26%). In orthopaedic procedures the RR of exposure to RBC transfusion was 0.46 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.57) compared to 0.77 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.86) for cardiac procedures. The use of cell salvage resulted in an average saving of 0.68 units of allogeneic RBC per patient (WMD -0.68; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.49). Cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-03 03:07:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. The use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. However, the methodological quality of trials was poor. As the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation, transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients' treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:26:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood, have prompted reconsideration of the use of allogeneic (blood from an unrelated donor) red cell transfusion. The risks associated with volunteer donor blood transfusion (allogeneic blood) that has been screened by a competently managed modern laboratory are generally considered minimal, with the risks of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C (HCV) being extremely low (<LINK REF="REF-Glynn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glynn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 1997</LINK>). However, of great concern is that in many developing countries there is a high prevalence of such infections and transfusion services are inadequately equipped to conduct universal antibody screening (<LINK REF="REF-Lackritz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackritz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1997</LINK>). Meanwhile, in developed countries, although the risks of acquiring a transfusion-transmitted disease (TTD) are considered low, the costs associated with providing a safe and reliable blood product are escalating (<LINK REF="REF-Hadjianastassiou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadjianastassiou 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent concerns that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) could be transmitted by blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Houston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houston 2000</LINK>) have prompted blood transfusion services worldwide to adopt more stringent donor selection procedures and the deferral of current donors who may have been exposed to vCJD (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2002</LINK>). The ramifications of such actions have been, in some cases, the elimination of a sizable proportion of blood donors from an already declining volunteer donor pool. Blood is now, more than ever, an incredibly scarce resource.</P>
<P>Concerns regarding blood safety, continual blood shortages, and spiraling health costs associated with blood bank operations, have collectively generated considerable enthusiasm for the use of technologies intended to reduce the use of allogeneic blood (<LINK REF="REF-Forgie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 1998</LINK>). However, some of the alternatives to allogeneic blood have their own risks and are highly expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>With early reports suggesting that between 60% and 70% of all red blood cell units are transfused in the surgical setting (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lenfant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenfant 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surgenor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surgenor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1993</LINK>) and more recently, that half of all the blood transfused in the United Kingdom is to surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Regan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 2002</LINK>), it is of no surprise that considerable interest has been shown in a range of interventions designed to reduce perioperative allogeneic red cell transfusion. Generally, such interventions fall into three groups: (1) the administration of agents to diminish blood loss (e.g. aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid, fibrin sealant), (2) agents that promote red blood cell production (e.g. erythropoietin), and (3) techniques for re-infusing a patient's own blood (e.g. pre-operative autologous donation, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, cell salvage).</P>
<P>Cell salvage is one technique that has been used extensively in the surgical setting. Cell salvage (CS), alternatively known as 'auto-transfusion', is a term that covers a range of techniques that scavenge blood from operative fields or wound sites, and re-infuse the blood back into the patient. Cell salvage can be performed during the intra- and/or postoperative periods. To remove non-cellular matter prior to reinfusion, some of the devices use centrifugal washing of the salvaged blood (<LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review builds on the systematic review published by Huet et al (<LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>). It examines the evidence for the efficacy of cell salvage in reducing the need for perioperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in adult elective surgery and whether there is a greater reduction in allogeneic blood transfusion demonstrated in identifiable patient sub-groups. This review employs methods developed by the International Study of Perioperative Transfusion (ISPOT) study group (a ten country study of evidence, attitudes and practices relating to the use of alternatives to allogeneic blood transfusion) (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999b</LINK>).</P>

<P>The titles and/or abstracts of identified studies were screened by two independent authors. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to include adult patients, scheduled for elective surgery, who were randomised to cell salvage or to a control group that did not receive cell salvage. Study reports had to provide data on the number of patients transfused with red cells, or the volume of blood transfused. Two authors independently selected trials that met the defined inclusion criteria with disagreements resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:32:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors independently extracted study characteristics and outcomes using an article extraction form. The extraction form was used to record information regarding; randomisation criteria, trial methodology, the presence of a transfusion protocol, the type of surgery involved, treatment outcomes, and general comments.

<P>Sixty-seven trials of cell salvage (autotransfusion) reported data on the number of subjects exposed to allogeneic blood transfusion. These trials included a total of 6025 patients of whom 3048 were randomised to cell salvage. Overall, the use of cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 38% (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70). Heterogeneity between these trials was statistically significant (P&lt;0.00001, I=81%). The absolute reduction in risk (ARR) of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion was 21% (risk difference (RD) -0.21; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15) and, on average, 4.8 patients would need to undergo cell salvage so that one would avoid an allogeneic RBC transfusion (number needed to treat (NNT)).</P>

Forty-six trials reported the use of post-operative cell salvage. These trials included a total of 4361 patients, of whom 2209 were randomised to post-operative cell salvage. The risk of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion was reduced on average by a relative 37% in those patients treated with post-operative cell salvage compared to control (RR =0.63; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.74). Heterogeneity between these trials was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001, I = 83%). Nine trials reported the use of both intra- and post-operative cell salvage. These trials included a total of 737 patients of whom 357 were randomised to intra- and post-operative cell salvage. The use of intra- and post-operative cell salvage decreased exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion by a relative 30% (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.92).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Volume of blood transfused</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-two trials provided data for the volume of allogeneic RBC transfused. These trials included a total of 2321 patients, of whom 1172 were randomised to cell salvage. On average, the use of cell salvage reduced the volume of red cells transfused by 0.68 units per patient (WMD -0.68 units; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.49 units). Heterogeneity between these trials was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001, I = 75%). For those 27 trials that reported the use of a transfusion protocol the use of cell salvage reduced the amount of allogeneic blood transfused by an average of 0.69 units per patient (WMD -0.69 units; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.49 units). For those five trials that did not report the use of a transfusion protocol the use of cell salvage did not statistically significantly reduce the amount of allogeneic blood transfused (WMD -0.64 units; 95% CI -1.30 to 0.01 units). For both these subgroup analyses, heterogeneity between trials was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively).</P>
<P>When data were stratified by the type of surgery performed, greater reductions in the volume of allogeneic RBC transfused per patient were observed in trials that involved orthopaedic surgery (WMD -0.81 units; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.39 units) compared to cardiac surgery (WMD -0.67 units; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.44 units). For both these subgroup analyses, heterogeneity between trials was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively).

For orthopaedic trials both types of cell salvage were associated with significant reductions in transfusion exposure rates. For washed cell salvage the relative risk of exposure to red cell transfusion was reduced on average by 52% (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64) and for unwashed cell salvage there was a relative 53% reduction in risk of exposure (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63). For these subgroup analyses, heterogeneity was statistically significant (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0001, respectively). All four trials conducted in the setting of vascular surgery used washed cell salvage. For these trials, the relative risk of exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion was not statistically significant (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.15).

<P>In aggregate, 22 trials of cell salvage reported data for mortality. These trials included a total of 1788 patients, of whom 902 were randomised to cell salvage. For eight trials there were no reported deaths for either the intervention or control groups; therefore it was not possible to estimate the relative risks for these trials. Overall, the use of cell salvage did not statistically significantly impact on mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.88; I = 0%). Similar non-significant results were observed for those 16 trials that compared cell salvage alone to untreated controls (RR 1.41; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.05; I = 0%). It should be noted that two trials provided over 22% of the information in the analysis and six of the 16 trials reported no deaths in either the intervention or control groups. There were six trials of active versus active comparisons (cell salvage combined with another form of active treatment compared to an actively treated control group) that provided mortality data. These trials included a total of 656 patients, of whom 326 were randomised to cell salvage. For these trials there were nine recorded deaths; eight of which occurred in the control arms.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Principal findings</HEADING>
<P>We identified 75 randomised trials of cell salvage, carried out over a 29-year period (1979 to 2008). Overall, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that the use of cell salvage reduced peri-operative allogeneic RBC transfusion exposure by a relative 38% (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70). The average absolute reduction in risk (ARR) of exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion was 21% (RD -0.21; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15), equating to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4.8. The efficacy of cell salvage in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion appeared to be greatest in the setting of orthopaedic surgery. In this setting, cell salvage reduced the risk of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 54% compared to 23% in cardiac surgery. In orthopaedic surgery very little difference in treatment effects was observed between washed cell salvage (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64) and unwashed cell salvage (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63). This was not the case in cardiac surgery, where there were clear differences between washed cell salvage, which showed significant reductions in allogeneic red cell transfusion rates (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.80), and unwashed cell salvage, which appeared to be only marginally effective (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95). However, significant variation in treatment effects was observed for all of the main study outcomes.</P>
<P>In the case of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion, a relative risk reduction of 37% was observed when cell salvage was combined with another active intervention (for example pre-operative autologous donation (PAD), acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH), aprotinin) and compared with that intervention on its own. When cell salvage was compared to a non-active intervention (for example standard untreated control), a relative risk reduction of 39% was observed.</P>
<P>The use of cell salvage was also associated with only slight reductions in the volume of red cells transfused. Overall, in those patients treated with cell salvage, there was an average saving of 0.68 units of RBC per patient (WMD -0.68 units; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.49 units). When cell salvage was combined with another form of active intervention and compared with that intervention on its own, the reduction in the volume of RBC transfused was around 0.66 units of RBC per patient (WMD -0.66 units; 95% CI -1.02 to -0.30 units). Such a result may well have been expected as both groups were actively treated with some form of blood sparing intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sources of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The observed variation in treatment effects was in terms of both the size and direction of effect with relative risk point estimates for red cell transfusion exposure for the individual trials, ranging from 0.03 to 5.64. Of the 67 trials that provided data for the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red cell transfusion, more than half of these trials (n = 36) found that cell salvage did not statistically significantly reduce the risk of receiving a red cell transfusion. None of the subgroup analyses performed established a clear reason for the observed variability in treatment effect. Statistically significant heterogeneity was observed for all of the subgroup analyses performed.</P>
<P>The impact that trial methodological quality had on treatment effects was difficult to determine, as the majority of trials were of poor quality. The most concerning feature of the trials reviewed here is that only one trial reported a method of concealing treatment allocation that was judged to be adequate. A lack of allocation concealment has been shown to significantly influence the estimate of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). When trials that reported data for the number of patients transfused allogeneic red blood cells were stratified by methodological quality (adequate allocation concealment: yes, unclear, or no), the relative risks of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion varied only slightly. For those trials (n = 24) that were assessed as providing inadequate concealment of treatment allocation the relative risk of exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion was 0.62 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.75), whereas for those trials (n=42) that did not report the method used to conceal treatment allocation or it was unclear what method was used to conceal treatment allocation, the relative risk was 0.62 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>The majority of trials reviewed here were small with less than 60 participants in each trial arm. Reliance on small trials raises concerns about the effects of publication bias. Funnel plot assessment revealed some evidence of this in the form of a 'missing' population of small negative studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Although there is a clustering of trials around the null (RR = 1), there were very few trials that showed an overall negative result for cell salvage for allogeneic red cell transfusion exposure.</P>
<P>Although this review did not exclude studies on the basis of language, only six non-English studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Fragnito-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fragnito 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorentz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lorentz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menges-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Menges 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naumenko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Naumenko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosencher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosencher 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK>). For those studies published in English language, the relative risk of exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion was 0.61 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.70) compared to 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.79) for those studies published in languages other than English. Due to the lack of non-English language studies it is difficult to interpret these results with any degree of confidence. However, it is of interest to note, that although the heterogeneity in treatment effect for the English language studies was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001, I = 83%) this was not the case with those studies published in non-English languages (P = 0.89, I = 0%).</P>
<P>The main study outcome used in these trials was a practice variable (the decision to transfuse a patient with allogeneic red cells) and, as such, may have been a major source of bias. The decision to transfuse a patient requires a degree of subjectivity on the part of the clinicians, and as all the trials reviewed here were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation. This is a particularly important source of bias that may have potentially influenced the results in favour of cell salvage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events and other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Mortality, re-operation for bleeding, infection, wound complication, non-fatal myocardial infarction, thrombosis, stroke, and hospital length of stay did not appear to be adversely affected by the use of cell salvage. Even though one of the known risks associated with cell salvage is infection (due to contamination of the autologous product during the salvaging and reinfusion process), fewer cell salvage patients experienced infection (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99). However, cell salvage did not appear to be associated with any significant reductions in wound complications (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.55).</P>
<P>It should be noted that the event rates were small ranging for 1.2% in the case of stroke to 5.1% in the case of any infection. Therefore it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of cell salvage on important clinical outcomes. There were only two outcomes (any infection and non-fatal myocardial infarction) where the event rates in the control groups were greater than 3.5% (5.1% and 4.8%, respectively). From the very limited data, it appears that the potential benefit of cell salvage in reducing exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion, is not offset by serious adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical significance of the results</HEADING>
<P>In an attempt to avoid allogeneic blood transfusion during the perioperative period, technologies such as cell salvage have been introduced without firm evidence to support their use. Although cell salvage provides peace of mind, knowing a patient's own blood will be transfused should it be needed, cell salvage is not without its own risks and costs (<LINK REF="REF-Forgie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 1998</LINK>). The risks associated with cell salvage are well documented, and include, bacterial contamination of the salvaged blood, air embolism, nephrotoxicity, and coagulation disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Faught-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faught 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semmens-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semmens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spahn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spahn 2000</LINK>). In its most simplistic form, unwashed cell salvage merely represents a very laborious means of obtaining an autologous volume expander, which is not necessarily advocated due to the potential serious side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>). Although washed cell salvage provides a better quality blood product, the overall cost of this technology is rather substantial. However, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that cell salvage was cost-effective compared with all other transfusion strategies except ANH (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2006</LINK>). This study indicated that the net benefit of cell salvage was between 112 and 359 per person, compared with the allogeneic blood transfusion strategy, PAD, PAD plus erythropoietin (EPO), fibrin sealants, antifibrinolytics, and EPO. This study claimed that the use of cell salvage could result in net reductions in the volume of allogeneic blood transfused of between 6500 and 320,000 units per year, translating into annual savings to the National Health Service (NHS) of 0.73 million to 36 million (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Any intervention that forms part of a blood conservation strategy needs to be critically examined in respect to its cost-effectiveness. On the basis of cost alone, cell salvage may appear to be an attractive alternative to the other currently available technologies, in particular aprotinin. However, as highlighted by <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999a</LINK>, in many instances neither the cost of the technologists needed to operate the device nor the cost of the cell saver device itself are considered in the overall calculations of cost. Further to this, <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999a</LINK> propose that the conclusions of studies that suggest cell salvage is cost saving should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>The true value of avoiding allogeneic blood transfusion remains debatable. Those concerned with the risks of transfusion transmitted disease (TTD) will be more interested in avoiding blood transfusion completely, rather than reducing the volume of blood transfused. However, the importance of avoiding transfusion depends on the probability of avoiding disease transmission, or other adverse effects that have been attributed to blood transfusion, such as alloimmunisation or febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). The rate of HIV or viral hepatitis transmission in most developed countries is very low, due to the presence of quality blood screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 1997</LINK>). However, this assumption does not equally apply to developing countries where allogeneic blood is frequently administered without adequate screening in an environment where there is a high prevalence of viral pathogens amongst donors (<LINK REF="REF-Kimball-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimball 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1997</LINK>). In these settings there may be much greater clinical value in a range of interventions that diminish or avoid the need for allogeneic blood. However, the costs associated with such interventions may be prohibitive in developing countries, a situation that may well apply to cell salvage.</P>
<P>Most of the data have been collected in the context of major cardiac and orthopaedic surgery, where blood loss is often substantial. Consequently the applicability of the results to clinical settings where blood loss is minor is questionable. This review has highlighted the fact that cell salvage is frequently used alongside other interventions designed to minimise the need for allogeneic blood transfusion. This is particularly evident in the area of cardiac surgery, where over the last 10-20 years there has been a steady increase in the use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs (for example aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid), acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH), and pre-operative autologous donation (PAD). A meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2007</LINK>) of the aforementioned anti-fibrinolytic drugs showed that both aprotinin and tranexamic acid were highly efficacious in reducing surgical blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion in cardiac surgery. However, the findings of a Canadian study (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2008</LINK>), which reported an increased risk of death in cardiac surgery patients treated with aprotinin compared with the lysine analogues (tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid), led to the market suspension of aprotinin on November 5, 2007. The loss of aprotinin from the armamentarium of the cardiac surgeon has lead to a re-exploration of alternative approaches to haemostasis management (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence on the efficacy and safety of ANH and PAD has been reviewed by the International Study of perioperative Transfusion (ISPOT) group (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forgie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 1998</LINK>). The literature regarding these interventions is generally viewed as being of indifferent quality because of inadequate randomisation and lack of blinding of outcomes assessment. However, these techniques have been shown to have modest blood sparing effects. This and the growing evidence on the efficacy of transfusion triggers indicates that a more conservative approach to blood transfusion is generally desirable in patients without cardiovascular risk factors, such as ischaemic heart disease or cerebral vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1999</LINK>). This conservative approach, combined with the use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs may well offer the best approach for managing the transfusion requirements of patients in high-risk settings such as cardiac surgery. However, in settings other than cardiac, such as vascular and orthopaedic surgery, the choice of intervention that best minimises patient exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion is not that clear cut, although a more conservative approach to transfusion practice has been shown to be efficacious across a range of clinical domains (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2003</LINK>). The decision to use any of the current available technologies as an alternative to allogeneic blood transfusion, including cell salvage, will be primarily based on availability, cost, and surgeon preference. To delineate the efficacy of the various technologies used in non-cardiac settings is rather difficult as the current available evidence is equivocal.</P>

<P>The use of washed cell salvage appears justified in orthopaedic surgery. However, in situations where there are concerns about the safety of the blood supply, the use of unwashed, filtered cell salvage may well be justified. Although the use of washed or unwashed cell salvage in cardiac surgery may well be justified on the basis of the evidence reviewed here, due consideration needs to be given to those technologies (that is anti-fibrinolytic agents) that, unlike cell salvage, have been shown to significantly reduce peri-operative blood loss and re-operation due to bleeding in the context of cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2007</LINK>). Re-operation alone is associated with substantial additional costs due to additional surgery and costs associated with increased length hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1999</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is no need for further small randomised controlled trials of cell salvage in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery. The principal need is for large, methodologically rigorous, comparative trials to assess the relative efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of cell salvage in different surgical procedures. </P>
