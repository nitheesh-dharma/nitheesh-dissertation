<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that includes symptoms of hallucinations (sensations that appear real but are created by a person's mind), delusions (unrealistic beliefs) and apathy (lack of interest) which can significantly impact on people's lives. The main treatment is with antipsychotic medicines; however, some people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotic medicines (called treatment resistance), which is a major challenge in the management of schizophrenia. The antipsychotic medicine, clozapine, is an effective medicine to use if treatment resistance occurs; however, it can cause unwanted side effects that include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, tremor (shaking), and excessive salivation (mouth watering). A more serious side effect is the reduction in the number of white blood cells, which can lead to an increased risk of infection. Clozapine is often used in combination with other antipsychotic medicines for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and this review investigated the clinical effects and safety of various clozapine combinations.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trial's Register in August 2015 and January 2016 and found five clinical studies involving 309 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or related illnesses who were resistant to treatment but had shown some response to clozapine. The studies compared clozapine combined with the antipsychotic medicines (haloperidol, aripiprazole, amisulpride, quetiapine, sulpiride, ziprasidone and risperidone).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>It was not possible to perform an overall analysis because the five studies were too different. Therefore, all results were based on data from one study per comparison.</P>
<P>Aripiprazole versus haloperidol combination: there was no overall difference in the effectiveness of the two treatment combinations; however, the aripiprazole combination caused fewer side effects.</P>
<P>Amisulpride versus quetiapine combination: the amisulpride combination was more effective in treating schizophrenia in comparison with the quetiapine combination.</P>
<P>Risperidone versus sulpiride combination: there were no overall differences in clinical effectiveness between these combinations.</P>
<P>Risperidone versus ziprasidone combination: neither combination showed superiority over the other in improving the symptoms of schizophrenia.</P>
<P>Ziprasidone versus quetiapine combination: the ziprasidone combination was more effective in improving both mental and global state than the quetiapine combination.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The reliability of the evidence is questionable and was noted to be low or very low quality. Only a small number of studies, with limited data were available. No data were available for important measures such as quality of life and service use and no firm conclusions could be made. Further good-quality evidence is needed.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (to 28 August 2015) and MEDLINE (November 2008). We checked the reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials (RCT). For the first version of the review, we also contacted pharmaceutical companies to identify further trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included only RCTs recruiting people of both sexes, aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (or related disorders) and comparing clozapine plus another antipsychotic drug with clozapine plus a different antipsychotic drug.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis using a random-effects meta-analysis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to create 'Summary of findings' tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-21 15:22:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified two further studies with 169 participants that met our inclusion criteria. This review now includes five studies with 309 participants. The quality of evidence was low, and, due to the high degree of heterogeneity between studies, we were unable to undertake a formal meta-analysis to increase the statistical power.</P>
<P>For this update, we specified seven main outcomes of interest: clinical response in mental state (clinically significant response, mean score/change in mental state), clinical response in global state (mean score/change in global state), weight gain, leaving the study early (acceptability of treatment), service utilisation outcomes (hospital days or admissions to hospital) and quality of life.</P>
<P>We found some significant differences between clozapine combination strategies for global and mental state (clinically significant response and change), and there were data for leaving the study early and weight gain. We found no data for service utilisation and quality of life.</P>
<P>
<I>Clozapine plus aripiprazole versus clozapine plus haloperidol</I>
</P>
<P>There was no long-term significant difference between aripiprazole and haloperidol combination strategies in change of mental state (1 RCT, n = 105, MD 0.90, 95% CI -4.38 to 6.18, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There were no adverse effect data for weight gain but there was a benefit of aripiprazole for adverse effects measured by the LUNSERS at 12 weeks (1 RCT, n = 105, MD -4.90, 95% CI -8.48 to -1.32) and 24 weeks (1 RCT, n = 105, MD -4.90, 95% CI -8.25 to -1.55), but not 52 weeks (1 RCT, n = 105, MD -4.80, 95% CI -9.79 to 0.19). Similar numbers of participants from each group left the study early (1 RCT, n = 106, RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.22, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Clozapine plus amisulpride versus clozapine plus quetiapine </I>
</P>
<P>One study showed a significant benefit of amisulpride over quetiapine in the short term, for both change in global state (Clinical Global Impression (CGI): 1 RCT, n = 50, MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.42, <I>very low quality evidence</I>) and mental state (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS): 1 RCT, n = 50, MD -4.00, 95% CI -5.86 to -2.14, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Similar numbers of participants from each group left the study early (1 RCT, n = 56, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.60, <I>very low quality evidence</I>)</P>
<P>
<I>Clozapine plus risperidone versus clozapine plus sulpiride</I>
</P>
<P>There was no difference between risperidone and sulpiride for clinically significant response, defined by the study as 20% to 50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.68, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). There were similar equivocal results for weight gain (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.90, <I>very low quality evidence</I>) and mental state (PANSS total: 1 RCT, n = 60, MD -2.28, 95% CI -7.41 to 2.85, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). No-one left the study early.</P>
<P>
<I>Clozapine plus risperidone versus clozapine plus ziprasidone</I>
</P>
<P>There was no difference between risperidone and ziprasidone for clinically significant response (1 RCT, n = 24, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.27, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), change in global state CGI-II score (1 RCT, n = 22, MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.22, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), change in PANSS total score (1 RCT, n = 16, MD 1.00, 95% CI -7.91 to 9.91, <I>very low quality evidence</I>) or leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 24, RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.49, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Clozapine plus ziprasidone versus clozapine plus quetiapine</I>
</P>
<P>One study found, in the medium term, a superior effect for ziprasidone combination compared with quetiapine combination for clinically significant response in mental state (&gt; 50% reduction PANSS: 1 RCT, n = 63, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81, <I>low quality evidence</I>), global state (CGI - Severity score: 1 RCT, n = 60, MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.22, <I>low quality evidence</I>) and mental state (PANSS total score: 1 RCT, n = 60, MD -12.30, 95% CI -22.43 to -2.17, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was no effect for leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 63, RR 0.52, CI 0.05 to 5.41, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reliability of results from this review is limited, evidence is of low or very low quality. Furthermore, due to the limited number of included studies, we were unable to undertake formal meta-analyses. As a consequence, any conclusions drawn from these findings are based on single, small-sized RCTs with high risk of type II error. Properly conducted and adequately powered RCTs are required. Future trialists should seek to measure patient-important outcomes such as quality of life, as well as clinical response and adverse effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment resistance is one of the most important clinical challenges in the management of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Dold-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dold 2014</LINK>). There is no uniform definition of treatment resistance, however a review by <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2011</LINK> found that the majority of trials stipulated non-response to at least two previous antipsychotic drugs for at least six weeks. For people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine is considered first-line (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). A large number of randomised trials have demonstrated the superior antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine in both treatment non-resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2013</LINK>) and resistant participants (<LINK REF="REF-Samara-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samara 2016</LINK>). However, due the risk of agranulocytosis, clozapine is only recommended for treatment-resistant people.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Between 40% and 70% of people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia do not respond to clozapine (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>). As a result, a number of approaches to clozapine-resistant schizophrenia have emerged. These include pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. For pharmacological methods, <LINK REF="REF-Dold-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dold 2014</LINK> distinguish combination strategies, the simultaneous administration of two different antipsychotic drugs, from augmentation strategies, the addition of a drug of a different class, such as an antidepressant or mood stabiliser. Unfortunately, the terms combination and augmentation are often interchanged.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clozapine is a polyvalent drug that lacks high potency dopamine receptor blockade. It is thought that adding on an antipsychotic drug with strong anti-dopaminergic activity produces an additive effect and improve clinical response. A number of meta-analyses have been carried out to determine the efficacy of clozapine combination treatment, with inconsistent results. <LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2009</LINK> identified 21 studies comparing clozapine combination treatment to clozapine monotherapy or placebo. They found a significant benefit of combination treatment when all studies were included, but no significant effect when the data from the six double-blind studies were extracted and analysed separately. In comparison, <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2012</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis on 14 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials including 734 participants and found a small but significant benefit of combination treatment over placebo.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original version of this review highlighted the paucity of studies comparing different clozapine combination treatment strategies, and the methodological shortcomings of the included trials. In 2015, treatment-resistant schizophrenia remained a big challenge in clinical practice. One review on the pharmacotherapy of treatment-resistant schizophrenia concluded that there is no sufficient convincing evidence to recommend combination strategies generally (<LINK REF="REF-Dold-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dold 2014</LINK>). However, on the basis of scientific reasoning, the authors suggested choosing two antipsychotic drugs with a different receptor binding profile, for example a multi-receptor antagonist such as clozapine and a potent D2 antagonist. This pragmatic view is incorporated into treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). This review is needed to provide an evidence base for recommendations on combination treatment in people with schizophrenia who are clozapine resistant.</P>

<P>Two review authors (SB and MC) independently extracted data from the newly included studies in English and resolved any disagreement by discussion with another review author (AC or UO). For the new Chinese language paper, translators Jun Xia and Juan Juan Ren extracted the data. Thus, double extraction was possible for all studies.</P>
<P>Where data were presented only in figures, we contacted the authors requesting the raw data. When there was no reply, two review authors (SB and MC) independently made estimations from the figures. Where estimations were within 0.2, they were averaged and rounded to one decimal point.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3. Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. However, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data and only use change data if endpoint data were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4. Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:</P>
<OL>
<LI>standard deviations (SD) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; but see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>if a scale started from a positive value (such as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if 2SD &gt; (S - S<SUB>min</SUB>), where S is the mean score and S<SUB>min</SUB> is the minimum score.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P>
<P>We planned to enter skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants into additional tables rather than an analysis. This was not required as no meta-analysis was performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5. Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that could be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month). However, this was not required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6. Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we planned to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). Where data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-06 15:05:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors (SB and MC) independently assessed the risk of bias for the new studies using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. It was decided that where there were no or inadequate details, the risk of bias would be labelled as "unclear". We acknowledge that the risk of bias could alternatively have been labelled "high" in these cases. Indeed, when rating risk of bias as serious or very serious in the 'Summary of Findings' tables, it was decided where the risk of bias was predominantly unclear, this would correspond to a very serious rating, because of the high potential for bias. One review author (SB) updated the assessments made for the original studies to comply with the new format. AC supervised SB and MC in this process. We noted the level of risk of bias in both the text of the review (<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) and in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified no cluster trials. However, had clustering not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC (design effect = 1 + (m - 1) × ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we intended to only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies. However, we identified no cross-over trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>We identified no studies with more than two treatment arms. However, had this been the case, the additional treatment arms would be presented in comparisons if relevant. The binary data would be simply added and combined within the two-by-two table, and the continuous data combined following the formula in Section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data would not have been reproduced.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, the findings of a trial must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We decided that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within the analyses. However, if more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>If attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on an intention-to-treat basis. Those leaving the study early are all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. If any data were identified for these outcomes, we used the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - for those who did not. We planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes were to change when 'completer' data only were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>
<P>If attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and outcomes of these people were described, we included these data as reported. Where these data were not clearly described, for the primary outcome we assumed the worst for each person who was lost, and for adverse effects we assumed rates similar to those among participants who did continue to have their data recorded.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2. Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>SDs were not reported in one study, and presented only in figures in another. We planned to obtain the missing values from the authors. When this failed, and there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs available for group means, and either P value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we calculated SDs according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): when only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE × square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we planned to calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study's outcome and thus to lose information. We planned to examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3. Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that some studies would use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data were used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data were assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they were the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

The importance of the observed I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic depends on magnitude and direction of effects and strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a CI for the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). We interpreted an I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic estimate of 50% of greater accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 of the C<I>ochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. The random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. However, there is a disadvantage to the random-effects model as it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the random-effects model for all analyses.</P>

If the exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of the effect estimates, then we planned to include data from these trials in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>If required, we planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials where we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster-randomised trials. If there were substantial differences in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we would not have pooled data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome, but presented them separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Fixed and random effects</HEADING>
<P>We used a random-effects model to synthesis all data; however, we planned to also synthesise data for the primary outcomes using a fixed-effect model to evaluate whether the greater weights assigned to larger trials with greater event rates altered the significance of the results compared to the more evenly distributed weights in the random-effects model.</P>

<P>The original search for this review (March and November 2008) yielded 1331 references of potentially eligible studies, of which we obtained 68 full-text papers for a second assessment after checking titles and abstracts. After exclusion of papers not meeting the inclusion criteria (four studies not randomised, 14 did not include participants with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, 50 did not meet the intervention criteria e.g. no combination treatment arm comparison), the original review included three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e7_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Genç 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zink-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zink 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The search update (August 2015) yielded 358 additional references. We obtained nine full-text articles for a second assessment of seven individual new studies, four of which were English language and reviewed by SB, MC and OU, and three of which were Chinese language and reviewed by translators Jun Xia and Juan Juan Ren. After exclusion of papers not meeting the inclusion criteria (two did not include people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, three did not meet the intervention criteria, e.g. no combination treatment arm), we added two additional RCTs to the review (<LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK> reported the long-term data from a study with an earlier reference (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Dosing</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>, clinicians were allowed to prescribe the allocated pharmacological treatments (starting dose and dose changes) according to clinical status and circumstances. The mean baseline dose of clozapine was 413 mg/day (SD 157) for the haloperidol group and 418 mg/day (SD 141) for the aripiprazole group. The mean baseline dose of haloperidol was 2.1 mg/day (SD 1.3) and of aripiprazole was 8.7 mg/day (SD 3.9). Twelve week but not endpoint (52 week) mean doses were reported.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e7_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Genç 2007</LINK>, the mean baseline dose of clozapine was 550 mg/day (SD 127.09) in the amisulpride group and 536.95 mg/day (SD 125.42) in the quetiapine group. These doses remained stable throughout the study. The mean dose of amisulpride added was 437.03 mg/day (SD 104.32), and the maximum was 600 mg/day. The mean dose of quetiapine added was 595.65 mg/day (SD 125.21), and the maximum was 900 mg/day. Participants judged to be unable to tolerate the dose escalation schedule because of adverse effects were maintained at their maximum tolerated dose for the remainder of the study. No endpoint mean doses were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK> did not report the baseline clozapine dose, only the maximum, which was 400 mg/day in the risperidone group and 500 mg/day in the sulpiride group. Risperidone was started at 4 mg/day and the final dose was 6 mg/day; sulpiride was started at 800 mg/day and the final dose was 1200 mg/day. No endpoint mean doses were reported.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kuwilsky-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwilsky 2010</LINK>, the mean baseline dose of clozapine was 437.5 mg/day (SD 140.4) in the risperidone group and 370.8 mg/day (SD 150.0) in the ziprasidone group. Risperidone and ziprasidone were titrated starting with doses of 1 mg and 20 mg respectively. The final doses followed clinical requirements, with the mean dose of risperidone 3.82 mg/day (SD 1.8) and ziprasidone 134 mg/day (SD 34.4). During the trial, reductions of clozapine by 50 mg per week were allowed, and the mean dose of clozapine at the end point (52 weeks) was 325 mg/day (SD 185.4) in the ziprasidone group and 450 mg/day (SD 168.3) in the risperidone group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>, the baseline mean dose of clozapine was 479 mg/day (SD 56.5) in the ziprasidone group, and 481.3 mg/day (SD 51.7) in the quetiapine group. Ziprasidone and quetiapine were added during the first week. The dose of ziprasidone was titrated from 80 mg/day finishing at 120 mg/day to 160 mg/day, and the dose of quetiapine from 200 mg/day finishing at 400 mg/day to 750 mg/day. One week after ziprasidone or quetiapine was added, the dose of clozapine was reduced accordingly. No end point mean doses were reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>, 19 participants in the aripiprazole group and 15 participants in the haloperidol group left early during the 12-month follow-up period. Reasons for leaving by 12 weeks were given and included lack of efficacy, acceptability problems, and lack of adherence. All randomised participants who received at least one dose of the investigational drugs were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (except one participant for whom rating scores were not completed at three months and who was subsequently excluded from analysis of these variables).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e7_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Genç 2007</LINK>, five participants in the quetiapine group discontinued the study within the first two weeks for reasons of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (four participants) and lack of efficacy (one participant). One participant in the amisulpride group was missed in follow-up after the second week. These six participants were excluded both from the analysis and from reporting of baseline characteristics.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK> all participants completed the study (no-one left early).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kuwilsky-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwilsky 2010</LINK>, more than 50% of participants had left by 52 weeks. Seven out of 12 remained in the ziprasidone group and four out of 12 remained in the risperidone group. Reasons for leaving early included akathisia, feelings of agitation and insufficient treatment response. Four participants withdrew their consent with no further explanation given. Participants who left the study early were excluded from further assessment.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>, one participant in the ziprasidone group and two participants in the quetiapine group left early due to adverse effects. These participants were excluded from the analyses of global and mental state outcomes, but included in the analyses of adverse events.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8. Outcomes scales</HEADING>
<P>A variety of scales were used to assess clinical response and adverse events. We present details of the scales that provided useable data below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">8.1. Global state</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.1.1. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</HEADING>
<P>The CGI is a collection of rating scales commonly used in studies of schizophrenia that enable clinicians to quantify severity of illness, global improvement, therapeutic effect, and adverse effects during therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>). These mostly 7-point scales, from 'normal' (1 point) to 'extremely ill' (7 points), require the clinician to compare the person to typical people in their clinical experience.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">8.2. Mental state</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.1. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</HEADING>
<P>The BPRS is used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>). The scale has 18 items, and each item can be defined on a 7-point scale varying from 'not present' (1 point) to 'extremely severe' (7 points). Scoring is from 18 to 126.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.2. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</HEADING>
<P>The PANSS scale was developed to evaluate the positive, negative, and general symptoms in schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>). The scale has 30 items and each item can be defined on a 7-point scoring system varying from 'absent' (1 point) to 'extreme' (7 points). This scale can be divided into subscales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, mania (excited component), and aggression (Supplemental Aggression Risk Profile). Total PANSS score is from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate more pronounced symptomatology.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.3. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)</HEADING>
<P>The HAMD instrument is designed to be used only on people already diagnosed as having an affective disorder of depressive type (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>). It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a 5-point, from 'absent' (0 points) to 'very severe' (4 points), or a 3-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastrointestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a person at the same interview. The scores of the person are obtained by summing the scores of the two raters.<BR/>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.4. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)</HEADING>
<P>GAF is a rating scale for a person's overall capacity of psychosocial functioning scoring from 1 to 100 (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2004</LINK>). Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.5. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)</HEADING>
<P>The SAPS measures positive symptoms in schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984a</LINK>). It has 35 items split into four domains (hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behaviour, and positive formal thought disorder), each rated from 'absent' (0 points) to severe (5 points).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.2.6. Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)</HEADING>
<P>The SANS measures negative symptoms in schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984b</LINK>). It has 26 items split into five domains (affective flattening or blunting, alogia, avolition, anhedonia, and attention), each rated from 'absent' (0 points) to 'severe' (5 points).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">8.3. Adverse effects scales</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.3.1. Simpson Angus Scale (SAS)</HEADING>
<P>The SAS is a 10-item scale, with a scoring system of 0 points to 4 points for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>). A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.3.2. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (EPS)</HEADING>
<P>The EPS consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, with seven items scored on a 4-point scale from 'absent' (0 points) to 'severe' (3 points) symptoms, and a physician's examination for parkinsonism and akathisia (seven items), dystonia (one item), and dyskinetic movement (seven items), all scored on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6 depending on severity and frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>). The clinician also completes four clinical global impression scores for the severity of dyskinesia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.3.3. Hillside Akathisia Scale (HAS)</HEADING>
<P>The HAS consists of two subjective and three objective items which the assessor rates on a 5-point scale from 'absent' (0 points) to 'present and not controllable' (4 points) (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>). There is also a rating from 0 to 7 of severity of akathisia according to clinical experience, and improvement in condition compared to admission.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.3.4. Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS)</HEADING>
<P>The LUNSERS is a self-assessment tool for measuring the adverse effects of antipsychotic medications (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1995</LINK>). There are 41 questions covering extrapyramidal, psychic, anticholinergic, other autonomic, hormonal, allergic, and miscellaneous adverse effects. In addition, there are 10 'red-herrings' (questions which are intended to be misleading or distracting) designed to test for over-rating. It is a check-box format with a 5-point scale from 'not at all' (0 points) to 'very much' (4 points). A high score indicates a high adverse-effect rating.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">8.3.5. Udvalg for Kliniske Undersgelser (UKU) Side Effects Rating Scale</HEADING>
<P>The UKU is a clinician-rated score based on 48 items covering psychic, neurological, autonomic, and miscellaneous adverse effects, scored from 0 points to 3 points in severity over the last three days (<LINK REF="REF-Lingj_x00e6_rde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjærde 1987</LINK>). In addition, there is a 4-point scale for effect on daily performance from 'no side effects' (0 points) to 'side effects that interfere markedly with the participant's performance' (3 points).</P>

In both of these studies, a trial biostatistician was responsible for randomisation using a computer-based method. <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK> provided insufficient information to comment on allocation.</P>
<P>The remainder were rated as unclear. It was noted that in <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK>, the baseline characteristics of participants in the two groups (duration of illness, mean score on PANSS) were very similar. Considering that this study recruited only 30 participants per arm, it is difficult to explain this scenario by means of a proper randomisation or by chance alone.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK> provided details of allocation concealment. In this study, recruiting physicians were asked to contact an administrator at the co-ordinating site by telephone, who accessed a computerised system that provided the participant's allocated treatment. The administrator had no access to the randomisation lists, and the site investigators did not know the randomisation block size. This way, the treatment allocation was fully concealed, and this study was rated low risk. All other studies were rated as unclear.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>, 19 participants in the aripiprazole group and 15 participants in the haloperidol group dropped out during the 12-month follow-up period. Reasons for leaving early by 12 weeks were given and were balanced between groups. All randomised participants who received at least one dose of investigation drugs were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of their primary outcome (leaving the study early). Only one participant was not included in the analysis of the BPRS and LUNSERS continuous outcomes due to failure to complete these rating scales at three months. Therefore, this study was rated as low risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e7_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Genç 2007</LINK>, five participants in the quetiapine group dropped out and one participant in the amisulpride group was missed at follow-up at two weeks. These six participants were excluded from the analysis and from the reporting of baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference between groups, but this did not confirm the absence of bias, especially because this is a small study (n = 56). Moreover, reasons for incomplete data are not balanced between groups. Therefore, this study was rated as unclear risk for attrition bias.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK>, all participants randomised completed the trial, so was rated low risk for attrition bias.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kuwilsky-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwilsky 2010</LINK>, more than 50% of participants had dropped out by 52 weeks. There was no intention-to-treat analysis. As a result, this study is rated high risk for attrition bias. Moreover, the 52-week data has not been included in our analyses, as per our protocol.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>, the three participants who dropped out were excluded from the analyses of global and mental state outcomes, but included in the analyses of adverse events. Since the attrition rate was less than 5%, and reasons were balanced between groups, the study was rated as low risk.</P>

<P>Combination treatment strategies are commonly used for people with an incomplete response to clozapine. However, only a small number of studies have compared one combination treatment to another. The original review identified three RCTs, but the methodological rigour of these studies was felt to be too poor for analysis.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-21 15:22:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the comparative clinical effects of various clozapine combination strategies in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and partial response to clozapine. We identified five RCTs which included seven different combination treatment strategies (clozapine plus aripiprazole, haloperidol, amisulpiride, quetiapine, sulpiride, risperidone or ziprasidone). Of course, possible combination strategies exist that are not included in this review. Moreover, there is no unique definition of partial responsiveness, with each study stipulating their own criteria (with the exception of one study which provided no detailed information). The outcomes investigated varied across studies. All included measures of mental state, using a variety of rating scales including BPRS, PANSS, SAPS, and SANS, and three out of five studies reported change in global state, using the CGI scale. Few outcomes using rating scales were reported with dichotomous data. All studies investigated adverse effects, either with event rates or rating scales, but results were poorly reported and in some cases unusable. Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK>, reported data on weight gain that we could analyse. The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK> was leaving the study early. Although not a named outcome in the other studies, all reported on number of withdrawals, which we analysed as a surrogate marker for acceptability of treatment, as in <LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>. There were a number of outcomes that were not reported in any study. These included service utilisation outcomes (such as hospital admissions or number of days in hospital), and quality of life measured (for both recipients of care and carers), which have been included in the 'Summary of findings' tables to highlight the need for data on these patient-important outcomes in future trials. An outcome that was not included in our protocol but reported in two studies was clozapine dose (<LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuwilsky-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwilsky 2010</LINK>). A third study describes clozapine dose being reduced "accordingly" after introducing a second antipsychotic, but provided no data (<LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>). Clozapine dose is certainly an outcome of interest as reduction in dose may decrease the burden of clozapine adverse effects. This in itself may be a reason to initiate combination treatment.</P>
<P>Overall, the completeness and acceptability of the evidence relating to clozapine combination treatments versus other clozapine combination treatments was poor. There were insufficient data to make any recommendations for combination treatment strategy.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-03-08 11:41:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We systematically assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach for each outcome presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables. The GRADE approach takes into account study design, study limitation, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and publication bias. As it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis, inconsistency and publication bias do not apply to our comparisons. Overall, the quality of evidence assessed in this study was low or very low. All included studies purported to be RCTs, although only two provided detailed information on the means of randomisation. There was generally good applicability in terms of populations and interventions, with all studies including only participants with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or related disorders, and comparing two different clozapine combination strategies. However, some indirectness was introduced where attrition was used as a surrogate marker for acceptability of treatment. The degree of imprecision is assessed on an outcome-by-outcome basis, but it should be noted that for two studies rating scale data were estimated from figures in the table.</P>

<B>)</B>. Moreover, this was the only study with useable long-term data. The authors undertook an intention-to-treat analysis resulting in a low risk of attrition bias. However, the quality of evidence was limited by the naturalistic, open-label study design. As a result, the quality of evidence was rated low on all outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: CLOZAPINE + AMISULPIRIDE versus CLOZAPINE + QUETIAPINE (Genc 2007)</HEADING>
<P>In this study, participants who withdrew from allocated treatment were excluded from reporting on baseline characteristics and the analyses, preventing a true comparison of those randomised to each group (<LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e7_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Genç 2007</LINK>). The quality of evidence was rated very low on the outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach, with the exception of BPRS because it was powered to detect a difference. Moreover, the rating scale data were presented in figures without SDs, and so means were estimated and SDs calculated using the t scores provided in the text. Therefore, the data in the analyses will be imprecise.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: CLOZAPINE + RISPERIDONE versus CLOZAPINE + SULPIRIDE (Kong 2001)</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient information to assess the risk of selection, performance, and detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Kong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 2001</LINK>). In addition, the authors did not provide a working definition of partial response to clozapine, so the applicability in terms of population was unclear. As a result, the quality of evidence was rated very low on all outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: CLOZAPINE + RISPERIDONE versus CLOZAPINE + ZIPRASIDONE (Kuwilsky 2010)</HEADING>
<P>The study was limited by the naturalistic, open-label design (<LINK REF="STD-Kuwilsky-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwilsky 2010</LINK>). In addition, this was the only study rated as high risk for detection bias, as the rating scale assessors were not blinded to the treatment allocation. This study had the smallest sample size and the highest attrition rate. There was no intention-to-treat analysis resulting in a high risk of attrition bias. Indeed, the 52-week data were not analysable as per our protocol. The quality of evidence was rated very low on all outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach. It should also be noted that means and SDs were estimated from the figures for many continuous outcomes, and will therefore be imprecise.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 5: CLOZAPINE + ZIPRASIDONE versus CLOZAPINE + QUETIAPINE (Wen 2015)</HEADING>
<P>The study was described as randomised, but no details about the method or allocation concealment were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Wen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2015</LINK>). Since there was low risk of detection bias and the study was powered to detect a difference for a number of outcomes, this quality of evidence was rated low, rather than very low, for the majority of outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>

<P>Some relevant data were presented in the text without SDs, and was therefore unusable. All our attempts to obtain this data from the relevant authors were unsuccessful. It should be noted that one of the review authors is the author of an included study (<LINK REF="STD-Cipriani-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Cipriani 2013a</LINK>). This author did not extract data from their trial.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-21 15:22:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are aware of other meta-analyses of comparisons of clozapine combination with other anti-psychotic drugs versus placebo, but we know of no other reviews comparing two different combination strategies.</P>
<P>Unlike in the previous version of this review, we have extracted the data from the trials were possible, and presented the analyses. The previous version called for new, properly conducted RCTs comparing different combination treatments. Two new studies have been conducted since, and additional long-term data from another have been published. However, sample sizes remain small. Larger studies are still required to detect small effect sizes.</P>
<P>Recently, two important contributions in the field of schizophrenia and clozapine treatment have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Samara-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samara 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stroup-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroup 2016</LINK>). In a network meta-analysis including 40 blinded RCTs with 5172 unique participants a pattern of superiority for olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone was seen in other efficacy outcomes, but results were not consistent and effect sizes were usually small (primary outcome was efficacy as measured by overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia; secondary outcomes included change in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, categorical response to treatment, withdrawals for any reason and for inefficacy of treatment, and important adverse events) (<LINK REF="REF-Samara-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samara 2016</LINK>). Therefore, the authors concluded that insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic drug is more efficacious for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTs - in contrast to unblinded, randomised effectiveness studies - provide little evidence of the superiority of clozapine compared with other second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Network meta-analysis is very helpful in comparing the relative effectiveness and acceptability of competing treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2013b</LINK>), also in treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouse-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 2016</LINK>). However, several issues still need to be addressed when conducting a network meta-analysis for the results to be valid and correctly interpreted, especially in mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Mavridis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavridis 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Slightly different results were found in the second paper, where the authors compared the effectiveness of initiating treatment with either clozapine or a standard antipsychotic drug among adults with evidence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia in routine clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Stroup-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroup 2016</LINK>). US national Medicaid data from 2001 to 2009 were used to examine treatment outcomes in a cohort of people with schizophrenia and evidence of treatment resistance that initiated clozapine (n = 3123) or a standard antipsychotic drug (n = 3123). The primary outcome was hospital admission for a mental disorder, while secondary outcomes included discontinuation of the index antipsychotic drug, use of an additional antipsychotic drug, incidence of serious medical conditions, and mortality. Initiation of clozapine was associated with a significantly decreased rate of psychiatric hospital admission (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88), index antipsychotic discontinuation (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.65), and use of an additional antipsychotic drug (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.82). By contrast, clozapine was associated with a non statistically significant increase of incidence of diabetes mellitus (HR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.70), hyperlipidaemia (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.78), and intestinal obstruction (HR 2.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.44). According to this study, in adults with schizophrenia and evidence of treatment resistance, initiating clozapine compared with initiating a standard antipsychotic drug was associated with greater effectiveness on several important outcomes, so increasing the judicious use of clozapine should be warranted (together with vigilance to prevent and detect serious medical adverse effects).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>There is some low quality evidence that certain combination strategies are superior to others for particular outcomes. Aripiprazole may produce fewer adverse effects than haloperidol as an add-on treatment. Amisulpride and ziprasidone may produce a better short-term clinical response in terms of global and mental state scores than quetiapine. Risperidone may be superior to sulpiride in reducing delusions and hallucinations, and superior to ziprasidone in ameliorating low mood, but all this evidence is inconclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to show one combination strategy as superior to all the others. In addition, no study measured quality of life, an outcome of utmost importance to people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>There is no high quality evidence for the superiority of one combination strategy. What exists is low quality evidence from single randomised controlled trials for the benefit of one add-on therapy over another for certain outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Criteria for considering studies for this review</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of studies</HEADING>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. We included trials described as 'double-blind' if it was implied that the study was randomised. For example, if the demographic details of the participants in each group were similar. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>We included people of both sexes, aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia or related disorders (e.g. schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder), however diagnosed. There is no clear evidence that the schizophrenia-like psychoses are caused by fundamentally different disease processes or require different treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We divided outcomes into short term (less than three months) medium term (three to 12 months), and long term (over one year).</P>
<P>The primary measure of efficacy was clinical improvement on psychotic symptoms, measured either as a dichotomous outcome (proportions of participants with treatment response as defined by each of the studies), or as a continuous outcome (reported either as endpoint score or change from baseline to endpoint).</P>
<P>1. Clinical response.</P>
<P>1.1. No clinically significant response in global state (dichotomous outcome) - as defined by each of the studies.</P>

<P>1.4. Mean score/change in positive symptoms (continuous outcome).</P>
<P>1.5. No clinically significant response on negative symptoms (dichotomous outcome) - as defined by each of the studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies </HEADING>
<P>Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution, or journal of publication. Two review authors (MB and AC) independently inspected all reports of identified studies. We resolved any disagreement by consensus; however, where doubt remained, we acquired the full article. Two review authors (MB and AC) independently decided whether these then met the review criteria. There was no blinding to the names of authors, institutions, and journal of publication. We resolved any further disagreements by consensus with a third review author (CB) and if disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (MB and AC) independently extracted data and resolved disagreement by discussion with a third review author (CB). When this was not possible, we sought further information from trial authors.</P>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
<P>When insufficient data were provided to identify the original group size (prior to dropouts), we contacted the authors. Where possible, we converted continuous scores into dichotomous data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Management</HEADING>
<P>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms. Where possible, data were entered into Review Manager 5 in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a 'favourable' outcome for clozapine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in mental health trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). These scales vary in quality and many are poorly validated. It is generally accepted that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure) (<LINK REF="REF-Rust-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 1989</LINK>). Before publication of an instrument, most scientific journals insist that its reliability and validity be demonstrated to the satisfaction of referees. As a minimum standard, data were excluded from unpublished rating scales. In addition, the rating scale should be either: a self report; or completed by an independent rater or relative. We presented rating scale data that were provided by the treating physician but marked them with an (*) to indicate potential bias. More stringent standards for instruments may be set in future editions of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies </HEADING>
<P>We used the latest version of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. This instrument consists of six items. Two of the items assess the strength of the randomisation process in preventing selection bias in the assignment of participants to interventions: adequacy of sequence generation and allocation concealment. The third item (blinding) assesses the influence of performance bias on the study results. The fourth item assesses the likelihood of incomplete outcome data, which raises the possibility of bias in effect estimates. The fifth item assesses selective reporting, the tendency to preferentially report statistically significant outcomes. It requires a comparison of published data with trial protocols, when such are available. The sixth item refers to other sources of bias that are relevant in certain circumstances, for example, in relation to trial design (methodological issues such as those related to cross-over designs and early trial termination) or setting. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality in accordance with the C<I>ochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Where inadequate details of allocation concealment and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted the trial authors in order to obtain further information. If the raters disagreed, we made the final rating by consensus with the involvement, if necessary, of another review author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>When summation was appropriate with binary outcomes such as improved/not improved, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) statistic with a 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. In addition, as a measure of efficiency, we estimated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH) from the pooled totals. We calculated the NNTB/NNTH as the inverse of the risk difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.1. Summary statistic</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. This analysis was based on the random-effects model as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there was no statistically significant heterogeneity. If standard deviations were not recorded, we asked authors to supply the data. In the absence of data from the authors, we used the mean standard deviation from other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Continuous data may be presented from different scales, rating the same outcome. In this event, we presented all data without summation and inspected the general direction of effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2. Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: </P>
<OL>
<LI>standard deviations and means reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;</LI>
<LI>when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>if a scale starts from a positive value (such as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew was presented if 2SD &gt; (S - S<SUB>min</SUB>), where S is the mean score and S<SUB>min</SUB> is the minimum score.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. We presented skewed data in the 'Other data' tables rather than included in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.3. Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual participant data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. According to a previous published review of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2005</LINK>), we presented change data in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Again, without individual participant data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we presented only endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this, much of the published change data could have been excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We contacted authors of studies that only reported change for endpoint figures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). When clustering was incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we intended to use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with missing data </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss to follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). Since there is no evidence as to the degree of attrition which makes a reasonable analysis of the data possible, we included all trials in the main analysis. If, for a given outcome, more than 50% of the total numbers randomised were not accounted for, we did not present results as such data will be impossible to interpret with authority. However, if more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost but the total loss was less than 50%, data were marked with a (*) to indicate the result may be prone to bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Missing data</HEADING>
<P>When data were missing and the method of 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) had been used to do an intention-to-treat analysis, then we used the LOCF data with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. For studies that did not specify the reasons for people leaving the study early (dropouts), we assumed that these people had no change in clinical outcome variables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Clinical heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Statistical heterogeneity</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.1. Visual inspection</HEADING>
<P>We visually inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2. Employing the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic</HEADING>
<P>We investigated heterogeneity between studies by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was 50% or greater, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, data were not summated, but presented separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of reporting biases </HEADING>
<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data synthesis </HEADING>
<P>We employed a random-effects model for analyses throughout. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us and as a result significant between trial heterogeneity is implemented in the pooled estimate the random-effects model is usually more conservative in terms of statistical significance. The disadvantage of the random-effects model is that it puts added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>No subgroup analysis was planned.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If data were clearly heterogeneous we checked that data were correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit of analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained, we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point for if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote a mean value for the intervention effect. We would have wanted to explore heterogeneity. We prespecified no characteristics of studies that may have been associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted but plausible causes of heterogeneity, we discussed these post-hoc reasons and analysed and presented the data. However, should the heterogeneity be substantially unaffected by use of random-effects meta-analysis and no other reasons for the heterogeneity be clear, we presented the final data without a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness affecting 1% of the population throughout the world. The symptoms of schizophrenia are perceptions without cause (hallucinations), fixed false beliefs (delusions) with or without apathy, and slowing of movement or thought. In most Western countries, people who do not respond to the majority of common antipsychotic medicines (called treatment-resistant people) are tried on the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. If they do not respond to clozapine alone, then another antipsychotic medicine is usually recommended. This review looks at clinical trials which compare the response to a second antipsychotic medicine in people who are treatment resistant, and on clozapine.</P>
<P>In the present review, we looked at 48 studies, only four fulfilled the criteria to be included, the total number of people randomised was 246. Two studies lasted 52 weeks and the other two studies lasted eight weeks, and all compared different second antipsychotic medicines with clozapine (aripiprazole versus haloperidol, risperidone versus sulpiride, risperidone versus ziprasidone, and amisulpride versus quetiapine).</P>
<P>When specific symptoms of schizophrenia were studied, there was change for the better in all groups but no second antipsychotic was significantly better than the one it was compared to. When looking at side effects, people taking sulpiride were slightly more likely to have excessive salivation and weight gain than those taking risperidone. The people in the aripiprazole group showed an advantage in the perception of side effects, when people on clozapine plus aripiprazole were compared to those on clozapine plus haloperidol.</P>
<P>These four trials contained small numbers of people and the results were often not well recorded. Although there is a suggestion that adding a second antipsychotic medicine may improve general functioning and decrease the symptoms of schizophrenia, it is still not possible to say which antipsychotic medicine would help the most. A large, longer and independent trial should be done on people who have not responded completely to clozapine to find the most effective treatment.</P>
