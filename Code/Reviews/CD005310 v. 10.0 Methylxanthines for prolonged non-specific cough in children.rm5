<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Children with non-specific cough (dry and non-productive cough without any other respiratory symptom, sign or systemic illness) are commonly treated with a variety of medications to manage the symptom of cough. This review examined whether there was any evidence for using methylxanthines in children with non-specific cough. There were no randomised controlled trials that assessed methylxanthines for prolonged non-specific cough in children. In four non-randomised controlled studies, the researchers described that dramatic improvements in cough were seen within 2-14 days of taking oral theophylline. However, this is possibly a placebo and/or time period effect. There is no RCT evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for the symptom of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of methylxanthines using child appropriate cough outcome measures are needed. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including a variety of asthma medications. Methylxanthines, the main medication used for paediatric asthma for many decades in Western countries, is still widely used in non-Western countries. Also, methylxanthines have other pharmacological properties and their bronchodilator effect is only modest. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-28 16:36:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>There is currently an absence of reliable evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for symptomatic control of non-specific cough in children. If methylxanthines were to be trialed in children with prolonged non-specific cough, cohort data (thus limited) suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) would be seen within two to five days (and certainly within 14 days) of therapy. However methylxanthine use has to be balanced against the well known risk of toxicity and its low therapeutic range in children. Further research examining the efficacy of this intervention is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-29 11:19:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to general practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>) and causes significant anxiety to parents (<LINK REF="REF-Cornford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornford 1993</LINK>). Worldwide the desire to reduce the impact of the symptom of cough is reflected in the billions of dollars spent on over the counter cough and cold medications. Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>). While some children with chronic non-specific cough have asthma, the majority do not (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methylxanthines are pharmaceutically available as theophylline, aminophylline and caffeine. More recently, methylxanthine derivatives (pentoxifylline, propentofylline and pentiphylline) are used as neuro protective (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2004</LINK>) or vascular agents and not for diseases of the respiratory tract. Theophylline and aminophylline are currently the methylxanthines available for the respiratory tract. Currently, these medications are not commonly used in the majority of developed Western countries but are still widely used in the treatment of asthma in developing countries. In developed countries, before corticosteroids became the main therapeutic option for the management of paediatric asthma, these medications were previously extensively used in the management of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The frequently cited studies on 'cough variant asthma' in the 1970s and 80s used theophylline (amongst other agents that included major tranquillisers) (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>) which was the main therapeutic agent for asthma of the era (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2002</LINK>). However, methylxanthines have many other pharmacological properties and their bronchodilator effect is only modest (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1998</LINK>). The effects of methylxanthines on the respiratory tract include immunomodulation, decrease in diaphragmatic muscle fatigue, increase mucociliary clearance, and improvement of central hypoventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vassallo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vassallo 1998</LINK>). Indirectly its potential respiratory benefits include an "increase in endogenous secretion of cortisol, stimulation of release of endogenous catecholamines; positive inotropic effect on the heart and as a mild diuretic" (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2002</LINK>). Thus methylxanthines may have an effect on abnormal cough that is separate to its modest bronchodilator effect. Indeed a randomised controlled trial in adults showed that theophylline decreased cough associated with ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="STD-Cazzola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cazzola 1993</LINK>). Use of any medication has to be balanced against possible harm/adverse events. The use of methylxanthines in children has been associated with impaired neuro-cognitive function in children (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2002</LINK>) (although there is some controversy (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1996</LINK>)). Also, they have a narrow therapeutic range and toxicity effects including seizures. Methylxanthines also potentially impair the developing nervous system through its non specific inhibition on adenosine receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus although methylxanthines have a range of recognised benefits for the respiratory system (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1998</LINK>) including a possible impact on cough, their associated adverse events needs to be considered. A systematic review of the benefits (or otherwise) of methylxanthines on chronic non-specific cough would thus be useful to help guide clinical practice.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2010-10-11 11:25:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, all three reviewers independently reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text using specific criteria, the two reviewers (AC, HP) independently selected trials for inclusion. Agreement would have been measured using kappa statistics. It was planned that disagreement be resolved by third party adjudication (RH).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-07 17:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the following information would have been recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible subjects), inclusion and exclusion criteria, other symptoms, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of intervention, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data would have been extracted on the outcomes described previously. It was planned that further information be requested from the authors where required.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-01-21 10:01:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies included in the review would have undergone quality assessment performed independently by two review authors using the 'risk of bias' tool in Revman 5. </P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-01-22 05:40:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>The data would have been analysed as follows. For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies would have examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This would have taken into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest would have been included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) would have been calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, REVMAN version 5). For cross-over studies, mean treatment differences would have been calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed effects generic inverse variance (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted SD unit difference and 95% confidence intervals. In cross-over trials, only data from the first arm would be included in meta analysis if data were combined with parallel studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Numbers needed to treat (NNT) would have been calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). This calculator converts the risk in the placebo group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the treated group, and converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT. The cough indices would have been assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes can be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference would have been estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results would have been described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model would have been included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>In the absence of appropriate RCTs, four other paediatric papers (<LINK REF="STD-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cloutier 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Konig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Konig 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yahav-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Yahav 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hannaway 1982</LINK>) that specifically reported on the effect of theophylline on cough in children were also reviewed. All four studies (see excluded table) were non randomised controlled trials and all reported a rapid response, mostly within two to five days and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Konig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Konig 1981</LINK>) used theophylline for up to 14 days. One adult study (<LINK REF="STD-Cazzola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cazzola 1993</LINK>) that was a double blind RCT was also reviewed; in this trial, complete remission in cough was reported in eight of the ten adults after two weeks of oral theophylline. No relevant papers have been identified in update searches.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-28 16:35:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>No randomised controlled trials comparing methylxanthines with a placebo in children with non-specific cough were identified. Cohort studies were thus reviewed and while no conclusion about efficacy of theophylline for non specific cough can be made, these studies show that the 'time response' was short i.e. within two days to two weeks. These early studies on the relationship between cough and asthma also show that in many children, other symptoms of asthma (dyspnoea on exertion (<LINK REF="STD-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cloutier 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Konig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Konig 1981</LINK>), chest pain on exertion (<LINK REF="STD-Konig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Konig 1981</LINK>), spirometry abnormalities and/or auscultation abnormalities (<LINK REF="STD-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hannaway 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yahav-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Yahav 1982</LINK>) were present. However some children in these studies had non-specific cough, and did not have clinical features of classical asthma yet all responded to theophylline. However this has to be interpreted in the context of methodological problems in studies with cough as an outcome measure, specifically the large placebo effect, biased subjective reporting, and period effect (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pharmacological properties of methylxanthines exceed that of its modest bronchodilator effect (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1998</LINK>) and although some of the non-RCT results emphasised its bronchodilator effect, it is unlikely that the rapid response to theophylline was purely related to this effect as the bronchodilator effect of theophylline is only modest.</P>
<P>Given the morbidity associated with chronic cough in children, there is a need for the evaluation of the efficacy of theophylline on non-specific cough in children. Its use however has to be balanced with its associated adverse events as briefly described above (background section).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-11 11:27:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-11 11:27:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>With the lack of evidence, the routine use of methylxanthines in treating children with non-specific cough cannot be recommended. If methylxanthines were to be trialed in these children, current (but old and limited) cohort data suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) usually occurs within two to five days of therapy and definitely within two weeks. However the use of methylxanthines in children with non-specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of toxicity and its narrow therapeutic range in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-11 11:27:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of methylxanthines to determine the effectiveness in treating children with non-specific cough are clearly needed. Trials should be parallel studies and double blinded, given the known problems in studying cough, specifically the large placebo and time period effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Based on cohort data, a short trial of two weeks would suffice. Outcome measures for the clinical studies on cough should be clearly defined using validated subjective data and supported by objective data when possible.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Yahav-1982">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Non randomised controlled trial. 4 of the 15 children had reversibility on spirometry and thus only 11 had non specific cough. 10 children treated with theophylline, 5 with inhaled salbutamol and 2 received additional corticosteroids. Authors reported that cough cleared in all children within 2-3 days.</P>
