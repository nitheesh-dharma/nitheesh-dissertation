Research estimates that between 2 in 1000 and 2 in 100 adults in the USA are affected by CFS. People with CFS often have long-lasting fatigue, joint pain, headaches, sleep problems, and poor concentration and short-term memory. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress for people affected by CFS. There is no clear medical cause for CFS, so people who are affected often deal with misunderstanding of their condition from family, friends and healthcare professionals. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend exercise therapy for individuals with CFS, and a previous review of the evidence suggested that exercise therapy was a promising approach to the treatment. It is thought that exercise therapy can help management of CFS symptoms by helping people gradually reintroduce physical activity into their daily lives.</P><P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2004, which showed that exercise therapy was a promising treatment for adults with CFS. Since the review, additional studies investigating the effectiveness and safety of exercise therapy for patients with CFS have been published.</P><P><B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B></P><P>&#8226; Is exercise therapy more effective than &#8216;passive&#8217; treatments (e.g. waiting list, treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility)?</P><P>&#8226; Is exercise therapy more effective than other &#8216;active&#8217; therapies (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), pacing, medication)?</P><P>&#8226; Is exercise therapy more effective when combined with another treatment than when given alone?</P><P>&#8226; Is exercise therapy safer than other treatments?</P><P><B>Which studies were included in the review?</B></P><P>We searched databases to find all high-quality studies of exercise therapy for CFS published up to May 2014. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and include adults over 18 years of age, more than 90% of whom had a clear diagnosis of CFS. We included eight studies with a total of 1518 participants in the review. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapy such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing; the remaining study used non-aerobic exercise. Most studies asked participants to exercise at home, between three and five times per week, with a target duration of 5 to 15 minutes per session using different means of incrementation.</P><P><B>What does evidence from the review tell us?</B></P><P>Moderate-quality evidence showed exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue compared to &#8216;passive&#8217; treatment or no treatment. Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people&#8217;s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.</P><P>One study suggests that exercise therapy was more effective than pacing strategies for reducing fatigue. However exercise therapy was no more effective than CBT.</P><P>Exercise therapy did not worsen symptoms for people with CFS. Serious side effects were rare in all groups, but limited information makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the safety of exercise therapy.</P><P>Evidence was not sufficient to show effects of exercise therapy on pain, use of other healthcare services, or to allow assessment of rates of drop-out from exercise therapy programmes.</P><P><B>What should happen next?</B></P><P>Researchers suggest that further studies should be carried out to discover what type of exercise is most beneficial for people affected by CFS, which intensity is best, the optimal length, as well as the most beneficial delivery method.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:12:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-14 16:52:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by persistent, medically unexplained fatigue, as well as symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, headaches and impaired concentration and short-term memory.

We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We combined serious adverse reactions and drop-outs using risk ratios (RRs). We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-26 11:51:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>We have included eight randomised controlled studies and have reported data from 1518 participants in this review. Three studies diagnosed individuals with CFS using the 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); five used the Oxford criteria. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 to 26 weeks. Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, whilst one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control (eight studies; e.g. treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility) or CBT (two studies), cognitive therapy (one study), supportive listening (one study), pacing (one study), pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Risk of bias varied across studies, but within each study, little variation was found in the risk of bias across our primary and secondary outcome measures.</P><P>Investigators compared exercise therapy with 'passive' control in eight trials, which enrolled 971 participants. Seven studies consistently showed a reduction in fatigue following exercise therapy at end of treatment, even though the fatigue scales used different scoring systems: an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 11 points (MD -6.06, 95% CI -6.95 to -5.17; one study, 148 participants; low-quality evidence); the same 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD -2.82, 95% CI -4.07 to -1.57; three studies, 540 participants; moderate-quality evidence); and a 14-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 42 points (MD -6.80, 95% CI -10.31 to -3.28; three studies, 152 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Serious adverse reactions were rare in both groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; one study, 319 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but sparse data made it impossible for review authors to draw conclusions. Study authors reported a positive effect of exercise therapy at end of treatment with respect to sleep (MD -1.49, 95% CI -2.95 to -0.02; two studies, 323 participants), physical functioning (MD 13.10, 95% CI 1.98 to 24.22; five studies, 725 participants) and self-perceived changes in overall health (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.40; four studies, 489 participants). It was not possible for review authors to draw conclusions regarding the remaining outcomes.</P><P>Investigators compared exercise therapy with CBT in two trials (351 participants). One trial (298 participants) reported little or no difference in fatigue at end of treatment between the two groups using an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD 0.20, 95% CI -1.49 to 1.89). Both studies measured differences in fatigue at follow-up, but neither found differences between the two groups using an 11-item fatigue scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD 0.30, 95% CI -1.45 to 2.05) and a nine-item Fatigue Severity Scale with a scoring system of 1 to 7 points (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.14). Serious adverse reactions were rare in both groups (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96). We observed little or no difference in physical functioning, depression, anxiety and sleep, and we were not able to draw any conclusions with regard to pain, self-perceived changes in overall health, use of health service resources and drop-out rate.</P><P>With regard to other comparisons, one study (320 participants) suggested a general benefit of exercise over adaptive pacing, and another study (183 participants) a benefit of exercise over supportive listening. The available evidence was too sparse to draw conclusions about the effect of pharmaceutical interventions.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-13 13:38:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes. A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but no conclusions for the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible. The effectiveness of exercise therapy seems greater than that of pacing but similar to that of CBT. Randomised trials with low risk of bias are needed to investigate the type, duration and intensity of the most beneficial exercise intervention.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:43:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:33:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-15 09:25:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterised by persistent, medically unexplained fatigue. Symptoms include severe, disabling fatigue, as well as musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, headaches, and impaired concentration and short-term memory (<LINK REF="REF-Prins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 2006</LINK>). Individuals experience significant disability and distress, which may be exacerbated by lack of understanding from others, including healthcare professionals. The term 'myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)' is often used, but 'CFS' is the term that has been adopted and clearly defined for research purposes, and it will be used in this review. The diagnosis can be made only after all alternative diagnoses have been excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2007</LINK>); several sets of criteria are currently used to diagnose CFS (<LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1991</LINK>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1994 diagnostic criteria for CFS (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>) are the most widely cited for research purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Fonhus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonhus 2011</LINK>), resulting in prevalence of CFS of between 0.24% (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2003</LINK>) and 2.55% (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2007</LINK>) among US adults. Practical application of diagnostic criteria may help to explain some of the observed variation in prevalence estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2013</LINK>). In practice, most patients visit their local general practitioner (GP) for assessment. A minority of patients may be referred to specialist clinics (e.g. neurology, infectious diseases, psychiatry, endocrinology or general medicine) for exclusion of alternative underlying disorders.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-13 13:42:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Exercise therapy is often included as part of a treatment programme for individuals with CFS. 'Exercise' is defined as "planned structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness" (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2001</LINK>); 'therapy' is defined as "treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder" (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-English-Dictionary" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford English Dictionary</LINK>). We define 'exercise therapy' as a "regimen or plan of physical activity designed and prescribed [and] intended to relieve or heal a disorder," and 'therapeutic exercise' or 'exercise therapy' can be described as "planned exercise performed to attain a specific physical benefit, such as maintenance of the range of motion, strengthening of weakened muscles, increased joint flexibility, or improved cardiovascular and respiratory function" (<LINK REF="REF-Mosby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosby 2009</LINK>). Aerobic exercise such as walking, jogging, swimming or cycling is included, along with anaerobic exercise such as strength or stabilising exercises. Graded exercise therapy is characterised by establishment of a baseline of achievable exercise or physical activity, followed by a negotiated, incremental increase in the duration of time spent physically active followed by an increase in intensity (<LINK REF="STD-White-2011" TYPE="STUDY">White 2011</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-26 13:19:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>Physical activity can improve health and quality of life for patients with chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2009</LINK>). The causal pathway for CFS is unknown; however several hypotheses have been proposed as to why exercise therapy might be a viable treatment. The 'deconditioning model' assumes that the syndrome is perpetuated by reversible physiological changes of deconditioning and avoidance of activity; therefore exercise should improve deconditioning and thus the condition of patients with CFS (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2011" TYPE="STUDY">White 2011</LINK>). However, mediation studies suggest that improved conditioning is not associated with better outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Fulcher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fulcher 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Moss_x002d_Morris-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moss-Morris 2005</LINK>). Some graded exercise therapy (GET) programmes are designed to gradually reintroduce the patient to the avoided stimulus of physical activity or exercise, which may involve a conditioned response leading to fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Fulcher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulcher 2000;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-White-2011" TYPE="STUDY">White 2011</LINK>). Mediation studies suggest that reduced symptom focus may mediate outcomes with GET, consistent with this model (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss_x002d_Morris-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moss-Morris 2005</LINK>). Evidence has also been found for central sensitisation contributing to hyperresponsiveness of the central nervous system to a variety of visceral inputs (<LINK REF="REF-Nijs-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijs 2011</LINK>). The most replicated finding in patients with CFS is an increased sense of effort during exercise, which is consistent with this model (<LINK REF="REF-Fulcher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulcher 2000;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2001</LINK>). Graded exercise therapy may reduce this extra sense of effort, perhaps by reducing central sensitisation (<LINK REF="STD-Fulcher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fulcher 1997</LINK>).</P><P>Further research is needed to verify these hypotheses, but effective treatments may be discovered without knowledge of the effective pathway or underlying cause.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:33:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2004</LINK>) suggested that exercise therapy was a promising treatment but that larger studies were needed to address the safety of this therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2004</LINK>). Such studies have been completed and their findings published, so that the present time is propitious for an updated review. Exercise therapy is often used as treatment for individuals with CFS and is recommended by treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). People with CFS should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment based on robust research evidence. This review will examine the effectiveness of exercise therapy, provided as a stand-alone intervention or as part of a treatment plan.

Settings varied from primary to tertiary care, which suggests easy generalisation. Most of the outcomes investigated were reported in the included studies, apart from health service resources. Most studies used aerobic exercise, but it would be preferable if we had found studies that used different types of exercise therapy, as this would reflect clinical practice.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-15 11:02:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>Risk of bias across studies was relatively low. We were able to identify pre-published protocols for only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wearden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wearden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2011" TYPE="STUDY">White 2011</LINK>) and have identified a risk of unpublished outcomes.</P><P>One limitation is that formal blinding of participants and clinicians to treatment arm is not inherently possible in trials of exercise therapy. This increases risk of bias, as instructors' and participants' knowledge of group assignation might have influenced the true effect. In addition, outcomes were measured subjectively (e.g. questionnaires, visual analogue scales), leading to risk that this might increase the outcome estimate. Against this, many patient charities are opposed to exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and this may in contrast reduce the effect. Six of the seven studies reported that investigators used intention-to-treat analysis, but this was done in different ways, which might have influenced the effect estimate. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) reported baseline differences, used a best linear unbiased predictor to avoid taking missing data into account and described 25 outcomes, with none stated as primary.</P><P>Several methodological challenges have become evident during the review process. An obvious topic of discussion is the between-study variation observed with regard to type of exercise, intensity of exercise and incremental procedures used (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). We acknowledge that an effect of exercise therapy is likely to depend on how training is conducted, thus inclusion of trials using different exercise regimens is likely to introduce some heterogeneity into the analysis. Possibly equally important, the treatment provided to participants in the control group was not uniform across included trials. Whereas the difference between waiting list, relaxation and treatment as usual is rather obvious, it is important to recognise that the actual ingredients of &#8216;treatment as usual&#8217; differ widely among the included trials, and this may contribute to variation in observed effect estimates. With regard to participants and their health status, it is important to realise that substantial differences in baseline illness severity were noted, as illustrated by the wide range in baseline physical functioning, depression co-morbidity and illness duration shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Some trials applied narrow selection criteria, whereas others seem to have included more heterogeneous sample populations; these differences might cause variation in the observed effect estimate. Our finding of similar outcomes with different definitions of CFS mitigates this risk.</P><P>All potential sources of heterogeneity mentioned above could have contributed to variation in results derived from the aggregate analysis presented in the present review and might have reduced our ability to draw firm conclusions. It is easy to imagine a potential correlation between observed treatment effect and factors such as exercise characteristics, control conditions, participant recruitment strategies, participant characteristics and baseline differences. We aimed to explore these associations in subgroup analyses. However, the number of potential heterogeneity factors is high and the number of available trials is low; therefore we were limited in our ability to explore heterogeneity in a sensible way at the aggregate level.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-22 13:35:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The strength of this review lies in its rigorous methods, which include thorough searching for evidence, systematic appraisal of study quality and systematic and well-defined data synthesis. Even though we tried to search as extensively as possible, we may have missed out on eligible trials, such as trials reported only in dissertations or in non-indexed journals.</P><P>The table of interventions (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) includes published and unpublished information regarding types of interventions, but not effect estimates. For this updated review, we have not collected unpublished data for our outcomes but have used data from the 2004 review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2004</LINK>) and from published versions of included articles.</P><P>The authors of this review had to make a cutoff regarding what kind of exercise should be included. We decided to exclude traditional Chinese exercise such as Tai Chi and Qigong, but to include pragmatic rehabilitation for which the type of exercise is described as walking, walking stairs, bicycling, dancing or jogging. The cutoff might be contentious, and discussion regarding what type of exercise should be included should be ongoing.</P><P>One of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2001</LINK>) is an outlier, reporting very positive results in favour of exercise therapy; we decided post hoc to perform a sensitivity analysis from which <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2001</LINK> was excluded to learn what the results would be if this study was not included.</P><P>Review authors noted potential bias regarding how the comparators in this review were categorised and pooled. We decided to report diverse comparators such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive therapy treatment (COG) and supportive therapy together as a single comparator called 'psychological treatments' (however, because of clinical and contextual heterogeneity, we decided not to pool the results in meta-analyses). These different psychological treatments do have similar elements, for example, both CBT and COG use cognitive approaches and goal setting; however they differ in certain respects (e.g. CBT tries to change unhelpful thoughts, while COG aims to accept them (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>)). Our approach of combining these comparators might be considered contentious, and discussion about what should be lumped together and what should be split into different comparators should be ongoing.</P><P>Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) constitutes an alternative approach to meta-analysis of aggregate data. Analysis based on individual patient data in general will enable us to use a wider range of statistical and analytical approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In particular, by utilising IPD, it is possible to explore the relative importance of the various heterogeneity factors mentioned above more thoroughly, and to ensure that missing data and baseline differences are dealt with in standardised ways. With access to IPD, it is also possible to perform subgroup analyses that have not been previously reported. A project aimed at undertaking IPD analyses of the trials included in the present review has been initiated, and when the IPD analyses are presented, they are likely to shed some new light on the aggregate level analyses presented in the current systematic review.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-13 15:03:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review is an updated version of a review that was originally published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2004</LINK>); the revised version offers major additions and changes. According to recent updates provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, we have implemented several methodological improvements, including a thorough risk of bias assessment for all included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Also, the updated search for literature led to the inclusion of three new trials with a total of 1051 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wearden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wearden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2011" TYPE="STUDY">White 2011</LINK>), thus the number of included participants has more than tripled since the 2004 version. The inclusion of new trials has important implications. First, statistical power has been increased by the addition of new data. Second, the most recent trials offered longer follow-up times; therefore we can provide more clear conclusions about follow-up treatment effects in this update than were provided in the original review. Third, the most recent trials involve comparisons beyond exercise therapy versus treatment as usual, for example, comparisons of exercise therapy versus other active treatment strategies such as CBT and adaptive pacing therapy.</P><P>This update provides valuable additional information when compared with the original review, and results reported in the original review are largely confirmed in this update. Moreover, the results reported here correspond well with those of other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larun-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larun 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 2006</LINK>) and with existing guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). One meta-analysis of CBT and GET suggests that the two treatments are equally efficacious, especially for patients with co-morbid anxiety or depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Castell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castell 2011</LINK>).</P><P>A recent randomised trial comparing quality of life among participants randomly assigned to group CBT plus graded exercise therapy plus conventional pharmacological treatment or exercise counselling plus conventional pharmacological treatment found no differences between the two groups at 12 months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2011</LINK>). This trial did not meet our a priori inclusion criteria and was excluded from our review. As the comparison used in <LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2011</LINK> differs from the comparisons reported in our review, it is difficult to compare the results directly; this comparison was complicated further by the fact that <LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2011</LINK> did not measure outcomes viewed as primary outcomes in our review. Consequently, our view is that the conclusions presented in our review correspond well with those of other relevant studies and reviews, but further research is needed to explore the considerable heterogeneity observed across available trials.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:43:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:43:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Encouraging evidence suggests that exercise therapy can contribute to alleviation of some symptoms of CFS, especially fatigue. Exercise therapy seems to perform better than no intervention or pacing and seems to lead to results similar to those seen with cognitive behavioural therapy. Reported results were obtained from patients who were able to participate (not from those too disabled to attend clinics); these results were inconclusive as to type of exercise therapy and showed heterogeneity. Few serious adverse reactions were reported. We think the evidence suggests that exercise therapy might be an effective and safe intervention for patients able to attend clinics as outpatients.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-12 01:01:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Further randomised controlled studies are needed to clarify the most effective type, intensity and duration of exercise therapy. These studies should report contextual characteristics of the exercise therapy provided, such as deliverer of the intervention, schedule, explanation and materials, supervision and monitoring. It is important that these trials measure health service use alongside the primary outcomes of fatigue and adverse effects, as well as alongside relevant secondary outcomes. Researchers should take care to describe which set of diagnostic criteria they have used and how they operationalised the diagnostic process.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2015-01-26 13:19:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>We would like to thank Peter White and Paul Glasziou for advice and additional information provided.

For the first version of this review (2004), assessment of methodological quality was conducted according to contemporary criteria of the handbook of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).The adequacy of allocation concealment was rated as adequate (A), unclear (B) or inadequate (C) or as not used (D), and the CCDAN Quality Rating System (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>) was applied. For this update, we reextracted data on risk of bias to comply with current recommendations, and we used concealment of allocation as the main quality criterion for included studies.</P><P>To explore possible differences between studies using different treatment strategies, control conditions and diagnostic criteria, we decided to perform post hoc subgroup analyses when applicable. We also performed post hoc subgroup analyses excluding <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2001</LINK>, as the results reported in this trial seem to have introduced considerable heterogeneity into the analysis. Moreover, in the protocol it is stated, "where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of the same scale, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs)." We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD); therefore we decided to report both MDs and SMDs in the Results section. In general, MDs are reported in the main Results section, whereas SMDs are supplied under the "Sensitivity and subgroup analysis" subheading.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Planned methods not used in this review</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies often employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. First, study authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>No cluster RCTs were identified in this version of the review. Should such studies be identified in future updates, we will use the following methodological approach. When clustering has not been accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation co-efficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). When clustering is incorporated, we will present the data as if from a parallel-group randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We will additionally exclude such studies in a sensitivity analysis.</P><P>If cluster studies are appropriately analysed by taking into account intraclass correlation co-efficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies will be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the potential for carry-over effect. This occurs when an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, psychological) of treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence of entry to the second phase, participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate when the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in CFS/ME, randomised cross-over studies were eligible but only when data up to the point of first cross-over were used. Data from the subsequent (second) period of the cross-over trial were not considered for analysis.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Multiple dose groups</HEADING><P>Some studies may address the effects of different levels of supervision and follow-up with regards to the exercise intervention and the comparator (e.g. sessions for designing exercise therapy, sessions for designing exercise therapy and planned telephone contacts, sessions for designing exercise therapy and seven face-to-face treatment sessions, usual care). Should we identify trials that take this approach in future updates, we will adopt the following approach. For dichotomous outcomes, we will sum up the sample sizes and the numbers of people with events across all intervention groups. For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations will be combined using the methods described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7.3.8) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Multiple medications</HEADING><P>Some studies may combine several interventions with one comparison group.

In the case of continuous outcomes, the total number of participants in the placebo group again will be divided up, but means and standard deviations will be left unchanged (see Chapter 16, Section 16.5.4, in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods intended for future reviews</HEADING><P>If future updates identify a number of studies that enable reporting at different time points, this should be done for example at end of treatment, at short-term follow-up (zero to six months), at medium-term follow-up (seven to 12 months) and at long-term follow-up (over 12 months).</P></SUBSECTION></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2015-02-03 15:32:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>A protocol for an accompanying individual patient data review on chronic fatigue syndrome and exercise therapy has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Larun-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larun 2014</LINK>).</P></PUBLIC_NOTES></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2017-12-15 11:40:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Bickerdike">

All participants were given a leaflet explaining the illness and the nature of this treatment. Treatment consisted of an explanation of chronic fatigue syndrome, generic advice such as to avoid extremes of activity and rest, specific advice on self-help according to the particular approach chosen by the participant (if receiving SMC alone) and symptomatic pharmacotherapy (especially for insomnia, pain and mood, n = 160)</P><P>Group 2, adaptive pacing therapy (APT): based on the envelope theory aimed at optimum adaptation to the illness by helping the participant to plan and pace activity to reduce or avoid fatigue, achieve prioritised activities and provide the best conditions for natural recovery. Therapeutic strategies consisted of identifying links between activity and fatigue by using a daily diary, with corresponding encouragement to plan activity to avoid exacerbations, developing awareness of early warnings of exacerbation, limiting demands and stress, regularly planning rest and relaxation and alternating different types of activities, with advice not to undertake activities that demanded more than 70% of participants&#8217; perceived energy envelopes. Increased activities were encouraged if participants felt able, and as long as they did not exacerbate symptoms (n = 160)</P><P>Group 3, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT): done on the basis of the fear avoidance theory of CFS. The aim of treatment was to change the behavioural and cognitive factors assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of participants&#8217; symptoms and disability. Therapeutic strategies guided participants to address unhelpful cognitions, including fears about symptoms or activities, by testing them through behavioural experiments. These experiments consisted of establishing a baseline of activity and rest and a regular sleep pattern, then making collaboratively planned gradual increases in both physical and mental activity. Participants were helped to address social and emotional obstacles to improvement through problem solving (n = 161)</P><P>Group 4, graded exercise therapy (GET): done on the basis of deconditioning and exercise intolerance theories of chronic fatigue syndrome. The aim of treatment was to help participants gradually return to appropriate physical activities and reverse deconditioning, thereby reducing fatigue and disability. Therapeutic strategies consisted of establishment of a baseline of achievable exercise or physical activity, followed by a negotiated, incremental increase in the duration of time spent being physically active.

Graded exercise is the current recommended exercise approach to CFS; it consists of self-paced (e.g. low-intensity) steady state exercise at a constant workload for a short time; as the patient's fitness gradually improves, the length of time and eventually the intensity are increased in a gradual graded manner, provided no adverse symptoms occur. Intermittent or interval exercise consists of short blocks of exercise at low to moderate intensity with a rest interval in between bouts of exercise (e.g. 1 minute of low-intensity cycling, followed by 1 minute of rest, followed by 1 minute of cycling); total time spent exercising can be gradually increased whilst rest or unloaded exercise intervals are maintained.

This model shows that high physical attributions will decrease physical activity and increase fatigue and functional impairment. A low level of sense of control over symptoms and focusing on physical sensations have a direct causal effect on fatigue. In CFS precipitating and perpetuating factors are important. The perpetuating factors become the focus of the intervention in CBT. An important subject in the therapy is the balance between activity and rest and the patients' responsibility to see to it. Negative beliefs regarding the symptoms of fatigue, self-expectations or self-esteem are identified and patients are encouraged to challenge them the conventional way. Specific lifestyle changes are encouraged if deemed appropriate. At the end of the therapy relapse prevention is addressed. Patients who are assigned to this group will attend 16 individual therapy sessions of one hour duration, spread out over 6 months with a psychologist or behavioural therapist.</P><UL><LI>Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation therapy (MRT): MRT includes CBT, GET, pacing and body awareness therapy (investigational treatment)</LI></UL><UL><UL><LI>CBT: as above</LI><LI>Graded exercise therapy (GET): structured and supervised activity management that aims at a gradual but progressive increase in aerobic activities. It is completed by graded activity and graded exercise in which a gradual and progressive increase in physical and mental activities is trained. Activities include activities of daily living and occupational and social or leisure activities</LI><LI>Pacing: helps the patient divide energy over the day/week. Eventually patients are encouraged to carry out a gradual increase in physical and mental activity</LI><LI>Body awareness therapy: teaches the patient to be aware of healthy physical sensations and to link them in the mind (body mentalisation). Patients are taught to react adequately to disturbances in the balance between daily workload and the capacity to deal with it. The balance between activity and rest is linked to the patient's inner control and to healthy physical sensations</LI></UL></UL><P>MRT includes the following</P><UL><LI>2 weeks: observation (2 sessions of 1 hour with psychology, 2 sessions of 1 hour with a social worker, 2 sessions of 1/2 hour with occupational therapy, 2 sessions of 1/2 hour with physiotherapy)</LI><LI>2 weeks: no therapy</LI><LI>10 weeks therapy (5 sessions of 1 hour with psychology, 4 sessions of 1 hour with a social worker, 26 sessions of 1/2 hour with physiotherapy and 20 sessions of 1/2 hour with occupational therapy)</LI><LI>6 weeks: no therapy</LI><LI>1 session of 1 hour with a social worker (after 6 weeks of no therapy)</LI><LI>2 sessions of both 1/2 and 1 hour of therapy with the therapist chosen by participants</LI></UL><P>During MRT, a participant sees the physician during rehabilitation 3 times (20 minutes per visit)<BR/>Total duration of both treatments is 6 months.

However, they seem to be listed on the website as mental health topics, alongside depression, etc. CFS is not a form of mental illness, although of course individual cases may have a psychological component that can be addressed during treatment. May I suggest that you place them elsewhere, as it is misleading and confusing to include them under the mental health umbrella?</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:28:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Many thanks for your comment on the two Cochrane CFS reviews. Apologies for the delay in responding, I have been on annual leave. We appreciate your observations about the placement of these reviews in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Feedback on reviews is normally dealt with by the relevant review author, but in this case I am responding, as your query relates more to an organisational issue. These reviews are listed as topics under a mental health heading because, as a result of the psychological component to which you refer, both reviews are supported by a mental health Cochrane group. Similar arrangements are in place for reviews of treatments for other disorders involving a variety of component problems and that as a result do not easily fit within the scope of one Cochrane group. These reviews however can be accessed in a number of different ways, for example, by searching for the specific topic (CFS and associated terminology, exercise and associated terminology, CBT and associated terminology); by searching for the study authors; by looking under subject headings, etc. The subject headings are not really intended as a comment on/guide to the aetiology of an illness, but they sometimes reflect the services involved in management of the condition. I have copied this response to the review authors in case they wish to comment further. Many thanks for your feedback.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:28:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cathy Stillman-Lowe (occupation freelance editor/science writer)<BR/>cathy.stillman-lowe@care4free.net<BR/>Submitter agrees with default conflict of interest statement:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM><FEEDBACK_ITEM ID="FBK-02" MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:32:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2013-08-07 14:52:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">Types of evidence included</TITLE><DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE DAY="3" MONTH="6" YEAR="2013"/></DATE_SUBMITTED><FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:29:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Unfortunately, this review ignores the large body of patient testimony suggesting that many persons with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis have been harmed by graded exercise therapy.</P><P>Since it was prepared, the International Consensus Primer and Guidelines for Medical Practitioners have been published.</P><P>Current thinking is to stay within your energy envelope. People with ME tend to overdo not underdo what they are capable of....</P><P>Care must be taken to NOT encourage them to do too much.</P><P>Further many definitions are used for CFS, and this muddies the waters.</P><P><B>I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:</B></P><P>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:32:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Thank you for your comments on this Cochrane Review.</P><P>In conducting this review, our aim was to gather and synthesise a specific type of evidence&#8212;that reported by randomised controlled trials. We fully accept that patient testimony, particularly that gathered and synthesised by high-quality qualitative research, is invaluable in any clinical area, particularly in an area as challenging for patients and healthcare professionals as CFS-ME. However, this project was not designed to incorporate such evidence.</P><P>We do consider the possibility of harm arising from graded exercise therapy by considering reported adverse events. Clearly this is an important issue to consider with any therapeutic intervention. Moreover, in the usual course of any illness, the condition of some patients improves (with or without treatment) and the condition of others worsens (with or without treatment). It is only through the use of randomised controlled trials that the effects (whether beneficial or adverse) of putative treatments can be disentangled reliably from the natural history of illness.</P><P>You raise the important point that (some) 'people with ME tend to overdo not underdo what they are capable of.' The critical point is the extent to which patients should be 'encouraged to do more' and the way in which they should be encouraged to do so. These are important research questions. As you know, new randomised evidence is available from the PACE trial, published in 2011 in <I>Lancet</I>. Whilst this is a controversial trial, it is an important randomised comparison of graded exercise therapy and 'adaptive pacing.' We look forward to further randomised evidence in due course.</P><P>We also look forward to continuing to work in this clinical area, in the hope that we can advance our understanding of the impact of this treatment approach.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:32:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Submitter: Adrienne.</P><P>Response prepared by Jonathan Price.</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM><FEEDBACK_ITEM ID="FBK-03" MODIFIED="2016-02-01 12:54:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies" NO="3"><TITLE MODIFIED="2015-10-14 10:52:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Comment 1 of 2</TITLE><DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE DAY="9" MONTH="9" YEAR="2015"/></DATE_SUBMITTED><FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-02-01 12:53:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P>I would first like to thank those involved for their work in preparing this document. Even for those of us who have read the individual Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) papers it is useful to have the results collated, as well as details regarding the interventions. Also it is interesting to see the results of sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, standardised mean differences, etc.</P><P>I would like to make a few comments. I&#8217;m splitting them into two submissions as the piece had become very long. I&#8217;ve added some loose headings to hopefully make it more readable.</P><P><B>Objective measures</B></P><P>The review assessed the studies as having a high risk of bias regarding blinding, since neither participants nor assessors were blinded. Evidence suggests that subjective outcomes are more prone to bias than objective outcomes when there is no blinding (1). It is thus unfortunate that the review concentrated almost exclusively on subjective measures, failing to include results from nearly all the objective outcome measures that have been published with trials. (The exception was health resource use for which you presented follow-up data from one trial).</P><P>I hope objective outcome data can be included in a future revision or edition of this review.</P><P>Examples of objective outcomes include: exercise testing (work capacity by oxygen consumption); fitness test/step test; the six minute walking test; employment status; and disability payments.</P><P>Adding in these results would allow a more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness and relevance of the therapies, their causal mechanisms, therapeutic compliance, and safety.</P><P>On exercise testing, for example, in the PACE Trial (the largest trial in the review) there was no improvement in fitness levels as measured by a step test (2). The fitness data contrasts sharply with the many positive results from subjective self-report measures in the trial, so one is left wondering how much the subjective measures reflect reality.</P><P>On another exercise test used in the PACE Trial, the 6 minute walk test, there was a small (mean) increase from 312 metres at baseline to 379 metres at 12 months: this was 35.3 metres more than the "passive" control group when adjustments were made. However, the final result of 379 metres remains very poor compared to the more than 600 metres one would expect from healthy people of a similar age and gender make-up (3,4). By comparison, a group with Class III heart failure walked an average of 402 metres (5). A score of less than 400 metres has been suggested as the level at which somebody should be put on a lung transplant list (6). Such information from objective measures helps to add important context to the subjective measures and restraint to the conclusions that can be drawn from them.</P><P>Objective data is also needed to check compliance with a therapy. If patients diligently exercised for 12 months one would expect much better results on fitness and exercise testing than the aforementioned results in the PACE Trial. This is important when considering adverse events and safety: such trials may not give us good information on the safety of complying with such interventions if patients haven't actually complied.</P><P>Employment and receipt of disability payments are practical objective measures of general functional capacity so data on them would help establish whether patients can actually do more overall or whether they may just be doing, for example, a little more exercise but have substituted that for doing less in other areas (7,8). Also, CFS patients are sometimes pressured by insurance companies into doing graded exercise therapy (GET) programs so it would be useful to have data collated on employment outcomes to see whether pressure can in any way be justified (9,10). In the PACE Trial, there was no significant improvement in employment measures and receipt of disability payments in the GET group (11). Outside the realm of clinical trials, the quantitative and qualitative data in a major (UK) ME Association survey also found that GET didn't lead to higher levels of employment and lower levels of receipt of disability payments on average (9). Also, extensive external audits were performed of Belgian CFS rehabilitation clinics that treated using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and GET. The main reports are in French and Dutch (12,13), with an English summary available (14) that says, "Employment status decreased at the end of the therapy, from an average of 18.3% of a 38h working week, to 14.9% [...] The percentage of patients living from a sickness allowance increased slightly from 54 to 57%." This contrasts with the average improvements reported in the audit for some symptoms like fatigue.</P><P>While data on (self-reported) symptoms like fatigue (one of your two primary outcomes) is interesting, arguably more important to patients is improving their overall level of functioning (and again, objective measures are needed here). Being able to work, for example, despite experiencing a certain level of fatigue would likely be more important for many than being unable to work but having slightly lower levels of fatigue.</P><P>An example of how reductions in the reported levels of fatigue may not lead to improvements in functioning can be seen in an analysis of three graded activity-oriented CBT therapy interventions for CFS (15). The analysis showed, compared to controls, there were no improvements in overall activity levels as measured by actometers despite improvements in self-reported fatigue (15). Activity in these trials was assessed using actometers. Another study that exemplifies the problem of focusing too much on fatigue scores after behavioural interventions is a study of CBT in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with &#8220;MS fatigue&#8221;(16). The study found that following the intervention, patients with MS reported significantly lower (i.e. better) scores on the Chalder Fatigue Scale (0-33 scoring) than those in a healthy, nonfatigued comparison group! This significant difference was maintained at 3 and 6 months&#8217; follow-up. It is difficult to believe that patients with MS fatigue (at baseline) truly subsequently had less fatigue than healthy nonfatigued controls: a much more likely scenario is that undertaking the intervention had led to response biases.</P><P>You mention that "many patient charities are opposed to exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)". One reason for concern about the way in which exercise programmes are promoted to patients is that they are often based upon models which assume that there is no abnormal physiological response to exercise in the condition, and make unsupported claims to patients. For example, in the FINE trial (Wearden et al., 2010) patient booklet (17), it is boldly asserted that: "Activity or exercise cannot harm you" (p. 49). However, a large number of studies have found abnormal responses to exercise, and the possibility of harm being done simply cannot be excluded on the basis of current evidence (discussed in 4, 18-20)."</P><P><B>Compliance</B></P><P>The review doesn't include any information on compliance. I'm not sure that there is much published information on this but I know there was a measure based on attendance at therapy sessions (which could be conducted over the phone) given for the PACE Trial (3). Ideally, it would be interesting if you could obtain some unpublished data from activity logs, records from heart-rate monitors, and other records to help build up a picture of what exercise was actually performed and the level of compliance. Information on adherence and what exercise was actually done is important in terms of helping clinicians, and indeed patients, to interpret and use the data. I mention patients because patients' own decisions about their behaviour is likely to be affected by the medical information available to them, both within and outside of a supervised programme of graded exercise; unlike with an intervention like a drug, patients can undertake exercise without professional supervision.</P><P><B>"Selective reporting (outcome bias)" and White et al. (2011)</B></P><P>I don't believe that White et al. (2011) (the PACE Trial) (3) should be classed as having a low risk of bias under "Selective reporting (outcome bias)" (Figure 2, page 15). According to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (21), the category of low risk of bias is for: "The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way". This is not the case in the PACE Trial. The three primary efficacy outcomes can be seen in the published protocol (22). None have been reported in the pre-specified way. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias states that a &#8220;high risk&#8221; of bias applies if any one of several criteria are met, including that &#8220;not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported&#8221; or &#8220;one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified&#8221;. In the PACE Trial, the third primary outcome measure (the number of "overall improvers") was never published. Also, the other two primary outcome measures were reported using analysis methods that were not pre-specified (including switching from the bimodal to the Likert scoring method for The Chalder Fatigue Scale, one of the primary outcomes in your review). These facts mean that the &#8220;high risk of bias&#8221; category should apply.</P><P>Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.</P><P>Tom Kindlon</P><P>Conflict of Interest statement: I am a committee member of the Irish ME/CFS Association and do a variety of unpaid work for the Association.</P><P>References:</P><P>1.

The primary outcomes were the same as in the original protocol, although the scoring method of one was changed and the analysis of assessing efficacy also changed from the original protocol. These changes were made as part of the detailed statistical analysis plan (itself published in full), which had been promised in the original protocol. These changes were drawn up before the analysis commenced and before examining any outcome data. In other words they were pre-specified, so it is hard to understand how the changes contributed to any potential bias. The relevant paper also alerted readers to all these changes and gave the reasons for them. Overall, we don&#8217;t think that the issues you raise with regard to the risk of selective outcome bias are such as to suspect high risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than us.</P><P>Kind Regards,</P><P>Lillebeth Larun</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2015-10-14 11:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Feedback submitted by: Tom Kindlon</P><P>Response submitted by: Lillebeth Larun</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM><FEEDBACK_ITEM ID="FBK-04" MODIFIED="2016-02-01 12:56:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies" NO="4"><TITLE MODIFIED="2015-10-14 10:53:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Comment 2 of 2</TITLE><DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE DAY="9" MONTH="9" YEAR="2015"/></DATE_SUBMITTED><FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-02-01 12:46:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies"><P><B>Variation in interventions</B></P><P>It would have been useful to have some more information on the &#8220;exercise with pacing&#8221; intervention tested in the Wallman et al. (2004) trial and how it was distinct from some other exercise interventions tested. The authors say (1): &#8220;On days when symptoms are worse, patients should either shorten the session to a time they consider manageable or, if feeling particularly unwell, abandon the session altogether&#8221; (p. 143). I don't believe the description given in the review conveys this. In the review, this approach is described as "Exercise with pacing: exercise in which the incremental increase in exercise was personally set." But Wallman et al.&#8217;s approach allows patients to decrease as well as increase how much exercise they do on the day. This approach also contrasts with how White (an investigator in two of the trials) has described graded exercise therapy: "if [after increasing the intensity or duration of exercise] there has been an increase in symptoms, or any other adverse effects, they should stay at their current level of exercise for a further week or two, until the symptoms are back to their previous levels" (2). In the PACE Trial manual White co-wrote (3), the GET intervention was guided by the principle that &#8220;planned physical activity and not symptoms are used to determine what the participant does&#8221; (p. 21); similarly, &#8220;it is their planned physical activity, and not their symptoms, that determine what they are asked to do&#8221; (p. 20). Compliance data would help us examine which approach patients are actually using: I suspect many patients are in fact doing exercise with pacing even in trials such as the PACE Trial (i.e. when they have increased symptoms, often reducing levels of exercise and sometimes doing no exercise activities at all on that day).</P><P><B>Bimodal versus Likert scoring in Wearden et al. (2010)</B></P><P>I find it odd that the fatigue scores for the Wearden et al. (2010) trial (4) are given in the 0-33 format rather than the 0-11 scoring method. The 0-11 scoring system is what is mentioned as a primary outcome measure in the protocol and is what is reported in the main paper reporting the results (4, 5). It is even what your own report says on p. 44 is the scoring method (&#8220;Fatigue Scale, FS; 11 items; each item was scored dichotomously on a 4-point scale [0, 0, 1 or 1]&#8221;). This is important because using the scoring method for which you don't report data (0-11), there is no statistically significant difference at the primary outcome point of 70 weeks (5).</P><P><B>Diagnostic criteria</B></P><P>One problem with using these trials as an evidence base, which I don't believe was mentioned, is that all the trials used the Oxford and Fukuda diagnostic criteria (6, 7). Neither of these criteria require patients to have post-exertional malaise (or something similar). Many consider this to be a core symptom of ME/CFS and it is mandatory in most of the other major criteria (8-11). [Aside: The London criteria were assessed in the PACE Trial (12) but they seem to have been operationalised in an unusual way. Ninety seven per cent of the participants who satisfied the (broad) Oxford criteria who didn't have a psychiatric disorder satisfied the definition of M.E. used (13). Ellen Goudsmit, one of the authors of the London criteria, has rejected the way they were used in the PACE Trial (14)]. So this lack of requirement for patients to have post-exertional malaise (or a similar description) means we cannot be sure that the evidence can be generalised to such patients. An independent National Institutes of Health committee this year concluded "continuing to use the Oxford definition may impair progress and cause harm. Therefore, for progress to occur, we recommend that this definition be retired" (15). An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review of diagnostic methods this year reached a similar conclusion: "Consensus groups and researchers should consider retiring the Oxford case definition because it differs from the other case definitions and is the least restrictive, probably including individuals with other overlapping conditions&#8221; (16). An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review of ME/CFS treatments said: "The Oxford CFS case definition is the least restrictive, and its use as entry criteria could have resulted in selection of participants with other fatiguing illnesses or illnesses that resolve spontaneously with time" (17).</P><P><B>Exclusion of some data from analyses due to baseline differences</B></P><P>It seems unfortunate that some data cannot be used due to baseline differences e.g. "Four trials (669 participants) contributed data for evaluation of physical functioning at follow-up (Jason 2007; Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011). Jason 2007 observed better results among participants in the relaxation group (MD 21.48, 95% CI 5.81 to 37.15). However, results were distorted by large baseline differences in physical functioning between the exercise and relaxation groups (39/100 vs 54/100); therefore we decided not to include these results in the meta-analysis". It would be good if other methods could be investigated (e.g. using baseline levels as covariates) to analyse such data.</P><P>Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.</P><P>Tom Kindlon</P><P>I am a committee member of the Irish ME/CFS Association and do a variety of unpaid work for the Association.</P><P>1.

We tried to describe the exercise programs, and differences between them in great detail. We did this both in the tables of study characteristics, and in the Characteristics of exercise intervention table (table 2). We also contacted trial authors to check that the information was correct. We recognize the need for more research to explore which parts of an exercise treatment program that are most essential or most closely correlated to an successful outcome, i.e. the active ingredient.</P><P><B>Bimodal versus Likert scoring in Wearden et al. 2010</B></P><P>To enable pooling of as many studies as possible in a mean difference meta-analyses, we used the 33-scale results reported by Wearden. You suggest that the decision to use the 33-point fatigue scores in our analysis may bias the results because there is no statistically significant difference at the 11-point data at 70 weeks. This statement suggests that there is a statistically significant difference when using the 33-point data, but if you look into analysis 1.2 that is not the case. At 70 week we report MD -2.12 (95% CI -4.49 to 0.25) for the FINE trial, i.e. not statistically significant.</P><P><B>Review authors response: Diagnostic criteria<BR/></B>As the use of various diagnostic criteria is often emphasised as particularly important with regard to treatment response, we performed subgroup analyses based on diagnostic criteria. The availability of relevant trials limits which subgroup analyses are possible to carry out in a systematic review, and hence, we were only able to contrast CDC versus Oxford criteria and found no evidence for a difference. We realize that the role of diagnostic criteria as a possible moderator for the efficacy of exercise receives a lot of attention, and would welcome trials to investigate these matters more thoroughly.</P><P><B>Exclusion of some data from analyses due to baseline differences</B></P><P>In meta-analysis based on aggregated data the authors have to act based on the information that is available from original publications or additional information obtained from the original investigators. As you state, these restrictions may be suboptimal. It is possible to adjust for baseline differences in meta-regression type analyses, but this requires adjustment for dependency between the intervention and control group results from the same trial. As a consequence, three variables (intervention vs control, baseline level, and trial) would have to be accounted for in the analyses. This implies that at least 30 data points will be needed to gain somewhat stable and trustworthy estimates adjusted for baseline levels. Systematic reviews based on individual patient data (IPD) allows for more appropriate processing and standardization of data. We are happy to inform you that we have now received individual patient data from most of the studies included in this review, and that the preparation of an IPD review is in progress.</P><P>Scroter S, Glasziou P, Heneghan C.

The scoring, in both cases, used the 0,0,1,1 system, with a scale of 011. This scoring system was described both in the trial protocol [3] and the main results paper published in 2010 [2].</P><P>The Likert (0, 1, 2, 3) scoring system was neither proposed in the trial protocol, nor formally published, and so the Likert scores should be considered posthoc. Even if it is argued that the Chalder fatigue questionnaire (irrespective of the scoring system) was predefined as a primary outcome measure, data using the Likert scoring system was neither proposed nor published and so the data itself must surely be considered to be posthoc. The outcome analyses using the Likert data must be considered posthoc.</P><P>Simply changing a scoring system may, at first glance, appear not to be a significant or major adjustment, however, we do not know what difference it made because a sensitivity analysis has not been published.</P><P>I cannot find any explanation within the Cochrane review that explains why the Cochrane review has replaced predefined published data with an unpublished and posthoc set of data.</P><P>Is it normal practice for a Cochrane metaanalysis to selectively ignore the predefined primary outcome data for a trial, and to selectively include and analyse posthoc data? I wonder if some clarity could be shed on this situation?</P><P>I suggest that the posthoc data are replaced with the original published data. Otherwise, the posthoc data should be clearly labelled as such and the risk of bias analysis amended accordingly&#894; and an explanation should be included in the review explaining why an apparently adequate predefined set of data has been replaced with an apparent novel set of posthoc data.</P><P>Also, I suggest that any discrepancies that I will outline below, should be corrected where necessary&#894; Either the analyses (1.1, 1.2, 2.1 and 2.3) should be amended or the description of the data should be amended so it is not incorrectly labelled as protocol defined and published data with a &#8220;low risk&#8221; of bias.</P><P><B>Discrepancies within the text of the Cochrane Analysis</B></P><P>Please note that all page numbers used below are pertinent to the current version (version 4) of the Cochrane review in PDF format.</P><P>1. On page 28 of the Cochrane review [1], in section &#8220;Potential biases in the review process&#8221;, under the heading &#8220;Potential bias in the review process&#8221;, in relation to the review in general, it is stated that: "For this updated review, we have not collected unpublished data for our outcomes ..." However, as explained above, this is not the case for the Wearden 2010 fatigue data for which unpublished data has been used in the Cochrane analysis.</P><P>2. On page 45 of the review, in section &#8220;Characteristics Of Studies&#8221;, specifically in relation to Wearden 2010 [2,3], it is stated that only protocol defined<BR/>outcomes were used: "all relevant outcomes are reported in accordance with the protocol". "Selective reporting (reporting bias)" is rated as "low risk". However, as explained above, this is not the case, because the Wearden 2010 fatigue data (used in the Cochrane analysis) was not proposed in the<BR/>protocol. If the data is posthoc, then the &#8220;low risk&#8221; category will need to be revised.</P><P>3. On page 44 of the review, in section &#8220;Characteristics Of Studies&#8221;, in relation to Wearden 2010 [2,3], under &#8220;Outcomes&#8221;, it is stated that Chalder fatigue was measured using the 0,0,1,1 scoring system using a scale from 011 points: &#8220;Fatigue (Fatigue Scale, FS&#894; 11 items&#894; each item was scored dichotomously on a 4 point scale (0, 0, 1 or 1)&#8221;. Wearden 2010 did indeed use the 0,0,1,1 scoring system for the Chalder fatigue scale: This scoring system was proposed in the trial protocol and published with the main outcome data in Wearden 2010. However, as explained above, this scoring system has not been used in the Cochrane analysis.</P><P>4.

We have the greatest respect for your right to comment on and disagree with our work. We take our work as researchers extremely seriously and publish reports that have been subject to rigorous internal and external peer review. In the spirit of openness, transparency and mutual respect we must politely agree to disagree.</P><P>The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to measure fatigue. The results from the Wearden 2010 trial show a statistically significant difference in favour of pragmatic rehabilitation at 20 weeks, regardless whether the results were scored bi-modally or on a scale from 0-3. The effect estimate for the 70 week comparison with the scale scored bi-modally was -1.00 (CI-2.10 to +0.11; p =.076) and -2.55 (-4.99 to -0.11; p=.040) for 0123 scoring. The FINE data measured on the 33-point scale was published in an online rapid response after a reader requested it. We therefore knew that the data existed, and requested clarifying details from the authors to be able to use the estimates in our meta-analysis. In our unadjusted analysis the results were similar for the scale scored bi-modally and the scale scored from 0 to 3, i.e. a statistically significant difference in favour of rehabilitation at 20 weeks and a trend that does not reach statistical significance in favour of pragmatic rehabilitation at 70 weeks. The decision to use the 0123 scoring did does not affect the conclusion of the review.</P><P>Regards,</P><P>Lillebeth Larun</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2016-06-21 12:07:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Feedback submitted by: Robert Courtney</P><P>Response submitted by: Lillebeth Larun</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM><FEEDBACK_ITEM ID="FBK-06" MODIFIED="2016-06-21 15:11:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="6"><TITLE MODIFIED="2016-06-21 12:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Feedback submitted</TITLE><DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE DAY="1" MONTH="5" YEAR="2016"/></DATE_SUBMITTED><FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-06-21 12:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><B>Comment: Assessment of Selective Reporting Bias in White 2011</B></P><P>With reference to the current Cochrane review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome [1], I would like to follow-up the discussion between Tom Kindlon and Lillebeth Larun that has been published in the latest version of the full review published in 2016. Kindlon submitted two comments, dated 9 September 2016, and Larun issued a response to each.</P><P>Kindlon raised the issue of the study referred to as "White 2011" in the Cochrane review, commonly known as the PACE trial [2]; specifically whether or not the risk of bias for selective reporting of outcomes for the trial has been assessed and categorised appropriately, in terms of Cochrane's guidelines and policies.</P><P>In this submission I will make reference to the current "Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions" [3], including Table 8.5.d ("Criteria for judging risk of bias in the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; assessment tool"), which I will refer to as the "Cochrane guidelines".</P><P>In his submission, Kindlon said: "I don't believe that White et al. (2011) (the PACE Trial) [...] should be classed as having a low risk of bias under "Selective reporting (outcome bias)"."</P><P>In a considered response, Larun concluded: "Overall, we don&#8217;t think that the issues you raise with regard to the risk of selective outcome bias are such as to suspect high risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than us."</P><P>Larun's response to the concerns raised by Kindlon has left me unsure about whether Cochrane's guidelines have been applied appropriately in this case, so I would like to discuss some of the finer details.</P><P><B>Pre-Planned Analysis</B></P><P>I note that the PACE trial's protocol was submitted for publication in 2006 and published in 2007 [4], which was after the trial had commenced in 2005 [2]. This raises the question of whether the protocol itself can be defined as a pre-trial report. Cochrane's glossary of terms defines a "pre-specified" analysis as a "Statistical analyses specified in the trial protocol; that is, planned in advance of data collection." [5] So the Cochrane glossary states that a pre-specified analysis plan, or protocol, must be completed before data collection has commenced.</P><P>Other sources, such as the Wiley Encyclopedia of Clinical Trials, also define a pre-planned analysis as that which has been defined before data collection has commenced: "A primary efficacy endpoint needs to be specified before the start of the clinical trial." [6]</P><P>To be certain that the PACE trial's analyses were defined before data collection had commenced then we would need an earlier publication such as a trial register [7] or trial identifier, both of which were created and which included definitions of primary endpoints which were different to the trial protocol (see appendix, below, for detailed descriptions). To my knowledge, the Cochrane review, does not discuss these issues.</P><P>Nevertheless, the Cochrane guidelines (section 8.14.2) advise using a trial protocol as a guide to determine which trial outcomes were pre-determined: "If the protocol is available, then outcomes in the protocol and published report can be compared".</P><P>As the protocol was published after the trial had commenced, it seems certain that any subsequent (i.e. after the protocol had been published) changes to methodology were made after data collection had commenced and were therefore not pre-specified.</P><P><B>Statistical Analysis Plan</B></P><P>Larun states that various changes from the protocol were "made as part of the detailed statistical analysis plan (itself published in full), which had been promised in the original protocol." The protocol did indeed refer to a statistical analysis plan, but the protocol wording suggests to me that no changes from the protocol were planned, but that the statistical analysis plan would simply flesh out the protocol: "A full Analysis Strategy will be developed, independently of looking at the trial database, and before undertaking any analysis. This paper [i.e. the protocol] summarises the analysis plan." There was no suggestion that there would be wholesale changes to primary, secondary or recovery outcomes. But, in any case, even if the investigators' initial intentions had been to make changes after data collection had started, the result would still not be a pre-specified analysis according to the Cochrane glossary of terms [5].</P><P>The statistical analysis plan was submitted for publication in 2012 and published in 2013 [8] after the main trial results had been published in 2011 [2], and long after the trial had commenced in 2005, so the statistical analysis plan cannot reasonably be considered to be a priori. Indeed the statistical analysis report itself confirms that the analysis was finalised or approved towards the end of data collection in 2010: "These planned analyses were written with a view to publication and are reproduced almost as they were approved by the Trial Steering Committee (Version 1.2 dated 2 May 2010) prior to database lock."</P><P>Larun states that the "changes [to the trial] were drawn up before the analysis commenced and before examining any outcome data. In other words they were pre-specified [...]" However, the latter assertion is not consistent with Cochrane's glossary, which states that pre-specified changes are those defined before data collection has commenced [5].</P><P>Investigators of an open-label trial can potentially gain insights into a trial before formal analysis has been carried out. If changes to a planned methodology are made after a trial has started and/or after data collection has commenced (whether or not the data has been formally analysed) then it is generally accepted that this fails the definition of a "pre-specified" study, which is confirmed by the Cochrane glossary and other sources. Otherwise trial registries and protocols could be drawn up after all data had been collected but before the formal analysis has commenced, and still be described as pre-planned. This would be particularly problematic in open-label trials such as the PACE trial.</P><P><B>Pre-Planned and Unplanned Primary Endpoints</B></P><P>The PACE trial's protocol had proposed three primary efficacy analyses which all had binary outcomes (i.e. a positive or negative outcome for each patient), whereas the final primary analyses were entirely different; they were continuous measures focused on the differences in mean improvements between intervention groups at 52 weeks. So the changes to the protocol were substantial. (See appendix, below, for detailed descriptions.) The PACE trial's three a priori primary efficacy analyses were not included in the final published results, and have never been published and, to my knowledge, no sensitivity analysis has been published for the final published primary analyses.</P><P>The PACE trial's published results paper [2] confirmed the unplanned outcome switching, as follows: "We used continuous scores for primary outcomes to allow a more straightforward interpretation of the individual outcomes, instead of the originally planned composite measures (50% change or meeting a threshold score)."</P><P>This entirely contradicts Larun's claims that: "the trial did pre-specify the analysis of outcomes" and: "The primary outcomes were the same as in the original protocol".</P><P>The Cochrane guidelines give guidance that is specific to the issue of changing a pre-planned analysis for the same set of data and they describe such an action as "selective reporting of analyses using the same data". The guidelines couldn't be more specific that changing a method for analysing the same set of data should be considered selective reporting.</P><P>The Cochrane guidelines (8.14.1) state: "Selective reporting of analyses using the same data: There are often several different ways in which an outcome can be analysed. For example, continuous outcomes such as blood pressure reduction might be analysed as a continuous or dichotomous variable, with the further possibility of selecting from multiple cut-points."</P><P><B>Scoring System for Chalder Fatigue</B></P><P>A change from the protocol, that will have had a direct impact on the Cochrane analysis, was the scoring system used for the Chalder fatigue scale. The PACE trial protocol proposed two self-report questionnaires as tools to use for the primary endpoint analyses: one was the Chalder fatigue questionnaire, and the other was the Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function subscale. The scoring system for the Chalder fatigue questionnaire was pre-defined as a bimodal scoring system (i.e. a score of 0 or 1 for each response to the 11 questions, giving a fatigue scale of 0-11). However, after data collection had commenced, the decision was to made to change to a continuous scoring system, known as the Likert system (i.e. a score of 0 ,1, 2, or 3 for each response to the 11 questions, giving a fatigue scale of 0-33). This change was made after the PACE trial's nominal 'sister trial', known as the FINE trial, had completed its analysis of very similar type of data using both the bimodal and Likert scoring systems. The FINE trial investigators had found no significant effect for their primary endpoint when using the bimodal scoring system for Chalder fatigue [9] but determined a significant effect using the Likert system in an informal post-hoc analysis [10]. The FINE trial has published its raw data, as part of the PLoS One data sharing commitment, and an informal analysis has shown that there may potentially be other significant differences in some outcomes, when changing from bimodal to Likert scoring [11].</P><P>With regards to risk of selective reporting bias specifically in relation to the PACE trial, the Cochrane review states: &#8220;Our primary interest is the primary outcome reported in accordance with the protocol, so we do not believe that selective reporting is a problem."</P><P>However, the Likert scoring system for the Chalder fatigue questionnaire is clearly labelled as a secondary outcome in the PACE trial protocol, and not a primary outcome. The protocol specifically lists "Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire Likert scoring (0,1,2,3)" as a "secondary outcome" only. This contradicts the above statement in the review (i.e. "our primary interest is the primary outcome reported in accordance with the protocol"), and it contradicts Larun's implied assertion that the Likert scoring system was "pre-specified" for use as a primary outcome measure.</P><P>So, to reiterate, the Likert scoring system, that the Cochrane review has described as a primary outcome measure, is specifically described as only a secondary measure in the PACE trial's protocol. It could not be more specific.</P><P>The change in questionnaire scoring methods is more than just a technicality, and may have made a significant difference to the trial's outcomes [11]. The rationale for the change (i.e. "to more sensitively test our hypotheses of effectiveness") may or may not be justified, and the change may or may not be beneficial in terms of better understanding treatment effects, but the fact remains that it was not part of a pre-specified trial plan.</P><P>Considering the issues discussed above, the analysis of the Chalder fatigue scores in the Cochrane review should undoubtedly, in my opinion, be considered an unplanned analysis and labelled as such.</P><P><B>Sensitivity Analysis</B></P><P>The Cochrane review focused on the mean differences between intervention groups, and whether there was a statistically significant effect, which is the same analysis as the PACE trial's final published outcomes.</P><P>Analyses of the PACE trial data using the pre-planned methods have not been published and, to my knowledge, a sensitivity analysis for the (unplanned) final outcomes has neither been published in the PACE trial literature nor the Cochrane review, so it is impossible for the reader to have insight into the impact of the changes.</P><P>In terms of what should be done when only post-hoc data is available the Cochrane guidelines (section 8.14.2) advise that a sensitivity analysis should be published: "It is not generally recommended to try to &#8216;adjust for&#8217; reporting bias in the main meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a better approach to investigate the possible impact of selective outcome reporting (Hutton 2000, Williamson 2005a)."</P><P>It would be helpful if this guideline was adhered to.</P><P><B>Assessment of Risk of Reporting Bias</B></P><P>As well as those outlined above, various other important outcomes in the trial were changed dramatically, such as the recovery analysis, which was reported in a separate publication [12]. Also, the pre-defined 'clinically important difference' was dropped, and was replaced with a 'clinically useful difference' which had an entirely different definition. There were too many deviations from the protocol in the final analyses to list them all in detail here.</P><P>The Cochrane guidelines (8.14.2) state: "The assessment of risk of bias due to selective reporting of outcomes should be made for the study as a whole, rather than for each outcome. Although it may be clear for a particular study that some specific outcomes are subject to selective reporting while others are not, we recommend the study-level approach because it is not practical to list all fully reported outcomes in the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table."</P><P>The Cochrane review currently designates the risk of reporting bias for the PACE trial as "low risk": Under the subheading "Characteristics of included studies" and under: "Selective reporting (reporting bias)", White 2011 is designated as "Low risk". This designation is repeated elsewhere in the review, such as the "Risk of bias summary" in Figure 2.</P><P>Kindlon pointed out that the Cochrane guidelines (Table 8.5.d) set out the criteria for the judgement of high risk of reporting bias as follows:</P><P>"Any one of the following:</P><UL><LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported;</LI><LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified;</LI><LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect);</LI><LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis;</LI><LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study."</LI></UL><P>I consider the trial to meet at least the first three of these requirements for a high risk of bias. However, in the response to Kindlon, Larun says: "Overall, we don&#8217;t think that the issues you raise with regard to the risk of selective outcome bias are such as to suspect high risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than us."</P><P>I find this claim impossible to square with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, for which, in my opinion, the PACE trial unambiguously meets at least three high risk criteria when only one is required to label the study as high risk.</P><P>The Cochrane guidelines advise that the bias risk of a study should be assessed by taking into account the study as a whole; and as all of the PACE trial's main published analyses, including the primary analyses and the recovery analysis, were not pre-planned, this suggests that the Cochrane report should have labelled the trial as having a high risk of reporting bias, according to my interpretation of the Cochrane guidelines.</P><P>I request that a revaluation is carried out, with reference to the Cochrane guidelines.</P><P><B>Definition of a Primary Endpoint</B></P><P>In his submission to Cochrane, Kindlon explained that the three pre-planned primary endpoint analyses were abandoned in favour of novel analyses in the final trial analysis: "The three primary efficacy outcomes can be seen in the published protocol" and "None have been reported in the pre-specified way.</P><P>I find Larun's response to Kindlon to be confusing and unsatisfactory. As far as my understanding goes, the response does not seem to take account of the Cochrane guidelines. Larun acknowledges that the scoring system for one of the primary outcome assessment tools, was changed: "the scoring method of one was changed", and she acknowledges that the trial's primary endpoint analyses were changed: "the analysis of assessing efficacy also changed from the original protocol."</P><P>However, Larun seems to contradict this by saying: "The [final] primary outcomes were the same as in the original protocol [...]"</P><P>Larun's latter statement contradicts the published results which state that the "originally planned" "primary outcomes" were switched: "We used continuous scores for primary outcomes [...] instead of the originally planned composite measures (50% change or meeting a threshold score)." [2]</P><P>The primary endpoints (i.e. criteria to judge a successful outcome) were defined in precise detail rather than simply being described as 'fatigue' and 'physical function'. Instead, a specific primary endpoint efficacy analysis was defined which included a required threshold for a positive outcome in fatigue and function at 52 weeks. Also, the questionnaire and scoring method was defined for each primary endpoint.</P><P>As the primary endpoint analyses were changed then I would argue that the primary outcomes were substantially changed.</P><P>A "primary efficacy endpoint" has been described as "a clinical or laboratory outcome measured in an individual after randomization that allows one to test the primary hypothesis and provides the means of assessing whether a therapy is effective compared with its control." [6]</P><P>An example of "Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed" is given in the Consort guidelines: "Example&#8212;&#8220;The primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion of patients achieving a 75% improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to 12 weeks as measured by the PASI [psoriasis area and severity index] Additional analyses were done on the percentage change in PASI scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions" [13]</P><P>In the PACE trial the primary objectives were to compare CBT and GET against SMC. To effectively achieve this comparison, a specific primary analysis was provided, as the primary endpoint, to determine a successful outcome. The results for the pre-planned primary endpoints have not been released.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>Larun says: "The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool enables the review authors to be transparent about their judgments, but due to the subjective nature of the process it does not guarantee an indisputable consensus."</P><P>I accept that assessment of bias can be subjective but, as I have outlined above, the issues relating to the PACE trial seem clear-cut, according to the Cochrane guidelines, which give very specific advice in relation to the type of the changes that we see here. I do not accept Larun's suggestion that this is a nuanced or subjective evaluation. PACE seems to fail at least the first three criteria in the 'high risk' category of the Cochrane risk tool for reporting bias.</P><P>The changes to the PACE trial's primary outcomes had the effect of lowering the threshold for a positive outcome and therefore portraying the interventions in a more positive light. A major purpose of a trial protocol is to avoid bias that can potentially arise through selective reporting. Avoidable bias does a disservice for the medical and patient communities and I would expect Cochrane to be rigorous in pointing out potential bias, and discussing the implications of bias, labelling bias correctly and including unbiased data where possible or including a sensitively analysis where possible. Indeed, this is what the Cochrane guidelines advise, and it is what the public expect of Cochrane. I feel that these issues have been neglected in this specific instance, and a reader of the Cochrane review in isolation would be unaware of any of the issues discussed above, relating to the PACE trial.</P><P>I ask for a reassessment and revaluation of this review in relation to the PACE trial and risk of bias.</P><P>Many thanks, in advance, for your careful consideration of these issues.</P><P>---</P><P><B>Appendix</B></P><P>PACE trial: protocol-defined primary endpoints - trial protocol [4].</P><P>Three Primary Endpoints.</P><P>"Primary outcome measures &#8211; Primary efficacy measures"</P><P>1. &#8220;The 11 item Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire measures the severity of symptomatic fatigue, [27] and has been the most frequently used measure of fatigue in most previous trials of these interventions.

I will raise concerns about the clarity with which the changes to the protocol have been explained in the review and I will question the justification given for switching the primary outcomes. I will compare the details of the pre-specified primary outcomes with the unplanned (revised) primary outcomes. I will explore how the protocol revisions have impacted the overall conclusions of the review, and how some review outcomes have been misrepresented in the main discussions. I will also briefly discuss potential biases involved in reviewing open-label studies that use self-report outcomes, and how such biases may potentially have affected the review's outcomes. Finally, I will discuss what I believe is: a lack of clarity in how the review has discussed and portrayed outcomes, and; a lack of depth in how potential biases have been considered and explored.</P><P>I will conclude by asking the reviewers to reassess the review, including the decision to switch the primary outcomes, with a view to improving clarity, rigour and accuracy. I specifically ask the reviewers to:</P><P>1. Amend the review as per the Cochrane guidelines (i.e. "every effort should be made to adhere to a predetermined protocol"), and revert to the pre-planned primary analyses; and</P><P>2. Clearly and unambiguously explain that all but one health indicator (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality of life, depression, and anxiety, but not sleep) demonstrated a non-significant outcome for pooled treatment effects at follow-up for exercise therapy versus passive control; and</P><P>3. Include a rigorous assessment of how the potential for bias may have affected outcomes.</P><P><B>Introduction</B></P><P>After detailed scrutiny of the current version of the Cochrane review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (version 4, dated 7 February 2016) [1], I have noticed that the primary outcomes of the review have not been reported as per the pre-specified review plan, but that unplanned (revised) primary analyses have been published in the place of the pre-specified analyses. (By 'unplanned', I refer to revisions to the methodology that were not pre-specified in the review's protocol.) The switching of primary outcomes (from pre-specified to unplanned analyses) is not mentioned in the main discussions, conclusion, or abstract, and is not explicitly explained anywhere in the review. I had to carry out a detailed inspection of the review to understand exactly what had been changed.</P><P>At the very end of the full version of the review, a section titled "[d]ifferences between protocol and review" explains the deviations from the protocol:</P><P>"[...] in the protocol it is stated, "where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of the same scale, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs)." We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD); therefore we decided to report both MDs and SMDs in the Results section. In general, MDs are reported in the main Results section, whereas SMDs are supplied under the "Sensitivity and subgroup analysis" subheading."</P><P>Although the above quote isn't explicit in referring to the primary outcomes, it explains the nature of, and rationale for, the unplanned changes to the review's primary outcomes. The only reason given for changing the pre-specified outcomes was that "the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference". No evidence is provided to support this assertion, and it appears to be an assumption about the readers' ability to interpret outcomes.</P><P>The outcomes of the review's pre-specified primary analyses are outlined in the analysis section, but are only mentioned briefly (i.e. only one or two sentences are used to explain each outcome), and the pre-specified outcomes are not discussed in the review's main discussions, abstract or conclusions. The pre-specified analyses have been relegated to the status of "sensitivity analyses", and it is not explicitly explained that these sensitivity analyses are the pre-specified primary analyses. It is easy for a reader to overlook these important outcomes and to misunderstand their significance. I am concerned that most readers will be unaware of these changes to the primary outcomes and of the significance of the changes to the protocol.</P><P>I consider the changes to have significantly altered the fundamental design, the main outcomes, and overall interpretation of the review.</P><P><B>Primary Outcomes</B></P><P>I would like to take this opportunity to explain the details of the changes to the primary outcomes to the reader, to the best of my understanding. The review compares exercise therapy with a passive control (e.g. treatment as usual), which is the focus of this submission. Outcomes for exercise therapy compared with other interventions (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy, supportive therapy, and pacing) are also included in the review, but are not central to the concerns of this submission and will not be discussed further. The review uses two primary outcome measures (fatigue and adverse outcomes) but adverse outcomes are not relevant to this submission. A primary analysis at both end of treatment (12 to 26 weeks) and at follow-up (52 to 70 weeks) is carried out. This submission focuses on primary analyses in relation to fatigue only, for exercise therapy versus passive control only.</P><P>The protocol defined two pre-specified primary analyses (one at end of treatment and one at follow-up) that were to determine the pooled treatment effects of all eligible studies on fatigue. The two analyses were to determine a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the pooled studies.</P><P>An unplanned decision was later made to relegate these pre-specified primary analyses to the status of sensitivity analyses and to replace them with two unplanned analyses which assessed the same studies but by a different statistical method. The unplanned analyses (1.1 and 1.2) do not provide an overall (pooled) treatment effect but provide mean differences in a number of sub-analyses of studies grouped together based on the specific tool or scoring method used to measure fatigue.</P><P>The two pre-specified primary analyses are published as sensitivity analysis 1.19 (fatigue at end of treatment) and another analysis (fatigue at follow-up) which has not been designated a numerical identifier. To reiterate; these two analyses provide the pooled standardised mean difference for fatigue for all eligible studies. Analysis 1.19 was included within the comprehensive set of tables published in the review, however, the follow-up analysis (which demonstrated a non-significant outcome) was (uniquely for primary outcomes) omitted from the set of tables (i.e. it was not published as a table) but was only briefly outlined under the subheadings: "Sensitivity analysis" &gt; "Investigating heterogeneity" (see appendix, below, for quote). As this analysis is not mentioned elsewhere in the review, and is only mentioned in one sentence, it is easy to miss.</P><P>To clarify; the unplanned analyses assess the same studies as the pre-specified analyses, but only the pre-specified analyses indicate the overall treatment effect for all eligible studies pooled together.</P><P>The outcomes of the two pre-specified analyses, using a pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) for all eligible studies, were that exercise therapy (versus passive control) at end of treatment (i.e. analysis 1.19) had a significant positive treatment effect (SMD: -0.68; 95% CI -1.02 to -0.35), whereas at follow-up the treatment effect was not significant (SMD: -0.63; 95% CI -1.32 to 0.06).</P><P>The unplanned primary analysis 1.1 (fatigue at end of treatment) includes three separate sub-analyses which all demonstrate a positive treatment effect, whereas unplanned analysis 1.2 (fatigue at follow-up) had mixed outcomes with two out of three sub-analyses demonstrating a significant treatment effect.</P><P>So, to reiterate, the pre-specified primary analyses demonstrate that exercise therapy (versus passive control) had a significant pooled treatment effect on fatigue at end of treatment, but no significant effect at follow-up. Whereas the unplanned (revised) analyses demonstrate significant treatment effects at end of treatment but mixed outcomes at follow-up.</P><P>The fact that unplanned analysis 1.2 (fatigue at follow-up) did not consistently demonstrate significant treatment effects is not explained with clarity in the main discussions of the review. For example, the outcomes are described as follows: "Moderate-quality evidence showed exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue compared to &#8216;passive&#8217; treatment or no treatment." (See the appendix, below, for more quoted examples.)</P><P>The main discussions in the review also fail to inform the reader that the pooled treatment effect on fatigue (compared to a passive control), for all eligible studies at follow-up, demonstrated a lack of significance, as per the pre-specified primary analysis.</P><P><B>All Outcomes at Follow-Up</B></P><P>Despite the limitations associated with self-report measures [2], physical function (a secondary outcome in the review) is widely considered a useful measure for demonstrating severity of illness and functional changes in outcomes for chronic fatigue syndrome [3,4,5]. It may be an especially helpful measure when assessing exercise therapy because exercise therapy is designed specifically to address physical function or tolerance to exercise, or both [6]. It seems reasonable to expect physical function to improve after a course of exercise therapy in chronic fatigue syndrome patients, if the therapy is clinically beneficial. The review reports that exercise therapy (when compared to passive control) has a positive effect on self-report physical function at end of treatment (analysis 1.5), but this effect is not sustained and there was no significant treatment effect at follow-up (see analysis 1.6).</P><P>There was also no significant effect on self-perceived overall health at follow-up (see analysis 1.15). Indeed, if we consider all of the health-related pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes for the review, for exercise therapy versus passive control, then with the exception only of sleep, all the indicators of health (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality of life, depression, and anxiety), showed no significant treatment effects at follow-up. (The remaining measures were: serious adverse reactions to treatment; drop-outs; and 'health resource use' for which a pooled effect size was not provided but which demonstrated non-significant differences between intervention arms in all but one of the sub-analyses.) This means that only sleep had a significant positive treatment outcome, at follow-up, as per the pre-specified health indicators, for exercise therapy versus passive control.</P><P>Put simply, apart from sleep, all the pooled analyses demonstrate that there were no significant health benefits from exercise therapy at follow-up.</P><P>These outcomes present a significantly different picture to the impression given by the review authors in their main discussions, abstract, conclusions and summaries wherein, for example, outcomes in general, including fatigue, physical function and overall health, are described as being broadly positive (e.g. it is stated that "patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy" and: "Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people&#8217;s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.") Furthermore, some specific erroneous information has been included in the main text to support the review authors' interpretation; i.e. the main discussion erroneously describes both physical function and self-rated overall health as indicating a positive treatment effect at follow-up, when in fact the outcomes (i.e. analyses 1.6 and 1.15) were not significant. The reviewers erroneously assert that: "A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment and at follow-up with respect to [...] physical functioning (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15)." (See appendix, below, for full quote.)</P><P>The non-significant outcomes seen in all but one of the pre-specified health indicators at follow-up (exercise vs passive control) were not discussed or explored in the discussions of the Cochrane review. I find this omission disappointing because the information would help to inform patients and clinicians of the ongoing treatment effects that they might realistically expect from behavioural therapies such as exercise therapy. I believe that the review would be more robust and helpful if it accurately highlighted and adequately explored these issues in the main discussions.</P><P>The health outcomes at follow-up would currently be completely lost on a reader who did not scrutinise the individual analyses of the review but relied upon the abstract or main discussions.</P><P><B>Bias Inherent in Open-Label Studies</B></P><P>Another issue that I believe is not explored with careful consideration is the possible implications relating to a review of purely open-label studies; i.e. the possibility that any initial positive treatment effects broadly seen in this review at end of treatment, may entirely, or to some degree, reflect biases inherent in trial methodologies that are unable to blind patients, therapists or trial investigators to the treatment arm. The review itself explains that formal blinding "is not inherently possible in trials of exercise therapy" and that this "increases risk of bias, as instructors' and participants' knowledge of group assignation might have influenced the true effect." The trend in this review towards non-significant effects, after treatment has ended, may lend strength to a concern that the initial self-report treatment effects are transient and may be the result of various inherent methodological biases in open-label trials that use self-report outcome measures [2,7,8]. Potential methodological biases in open-label trials using self-report outcomes may be, for example: inadequate control conditions; self-reporting bias; therapist allegiance; and/or unplanned changes to trial methodology [7,9].</P><P>Readers might be interested to note that, for White 2011, which was the largest trial included in the review, the follow-up data used in the review was at 52 weeks [10] but further follow-up data has also been published, at a median of 2.5 years after randomisation, which demonstrated no significant differences between intervention arms for the primary outcomes [11].</P><P><B>Summary of Outcomes</B></P><P>In summary, the pre-specified primary analyses for fatigue were to assess the pooled standardised mean differences. However, the reviewers then made a post-hoc decision to replace these analyses for which the only rationale provided was an assumption that a standardised mean difference is supposedly "more difficult to conceptualise and interpret". When all of the eligible studies are pooled, as per the pre-specified plan, the pooled treatment effect at follow-up is not significant. However, the promotion of the unplanned analyses has allowed the lack of a significant pooled treatment effect at follow-up to be overlooked and dismissed in the main analyses and discussions, to the point where the main discussions could be interpreted to indicate that the treatment effects for fatigue were entirely positive (see appendix, below, for quotes).</P><P>I question whether this is an appropriate level of clarity compared to what is expected from a Cochrane review. Cochrane reviews have a reputation of providing transparent, uncomplicated, straightforward and reliable explanations of complex and rigorous analyses, whereas this review has: used unplanned primary outcomes without a robust or evidence-based reason for switching outcomes; provided just one sentence to explain the changes to the pre-specified primary outcomes; omitted a crucial sensitivity analysis from the tables section; has not reflected the entire range of outcomes in the abstract, conclusions or main discussions; and has inaccurately described outcomes at follow-up for physical function and overall health.</P><P><B>Justification for Switching Primary Outcomes</B></P><P>The reason given for switching the primary outcomes in the review is: "We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD) [...]".</P><P>However, it is questionable whether the reason given for switching the primary outcomes justifies such an unplanned fundamental change in the methodology of the review; no justification is given as to why the reviewers believe that readers would find it easier to interpret the mean scores of a range of disparate fatigue questionnaires, in a series of sub-analyses, rather than a single standardised mean difference for a pooled analysis of eligible studies. It is not clear to me why it is assumed that a variety of separate fatigue scales should be easier to understand and interpret than a single standardised mean difference. As the changes to the protocol have had the effect of changing the primary outcomes at follow-up, this means it would be desirable to provide a well-reasoned case to deviate from the protocol and switch the primary outcomes.</P><P>The claim with regards to interpretability raises the question of why standardised mean differences are adequate for other Cochrane studies, but not this particular study. Cochrane has not adopted a policy of avoiding using standardised mean differences; instead the Cochrane guidelines (section 12.6) encourage their use [12]. So this decision appears to be a novel post-hoc decision specific for this study.</P><P>The Cochrane guidelines (section 12.6.1) actually suggest that ordinary mean differences can be difficult to interpret: "The units of such outcomes [i.e. mean differences] may be difficult to interpret, particularly when they relate to rating scales." [12] The guidelines (section 12.6.1) acknowledge that there may be difficulties in interpreting standardised mean differences: "Without guidance, clinicians and patients may have little idea how to interpret results presented as SMDs." The guidelines do not favour one method over another in general, but describe how each may be used for specific purposes; if one wishes to provide an overall treatment effect for studies that use different measures to measure the same construct, then the standardised mean difference is a standard tool which is used widely in Cochrane reviews and other research. The guidelines suggest that "[t]here are several possibilities for re-expressing [standardised means differences] in more helpful ways".</P><P><B>Implications Related to Changing Trial Protocols and Outcome Switching</B></P><P>The unplanned changes to the review make it vulnerable to potential bias or accusations of bias; conscious or unconscious personal or professional preferences have the potential to affect post-hoc decisions with respect to methodology. Even if investigators are scrupulous in the rigour of their decision making, unexpected biases have the potential to creep into unplanned decisions, which is an issue that factors into the reasons why pre-trial plans (e.g. trial registers and protocols) have become widespread [7], and are used for Cochrane reviews [12].</P><P>The Cochrane Guidebook for reviewers (Section: 2.1; "Rationale for protocols") [12] explains: "Post hoc decisions made when the impact on the results of the research is known, such as excluding selected studies from a systematic review, are highly susceptible to bias and should be avoided."</P><P>In the same paragraph, the guidelines also state: "While every effort should be made to adhere to a predetermined protocol, this is not always possible or appropriate."</P><P>However, it seems that, in this case, every effort was not made to adhere to the protocol because the unplanned changes seem to be based on preference rather then necessity, and the pre-planned analyses have not been shown to be inferior, inadequate or inappropriate.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>I find the changes to the protocol to be of particular concern for the following reasons:</P><P>1. The final primary analyses are unplanned and have replaced adequate, and arguably more helpful, pre-specified analyses;</P><P>2. The rationale provided for the changes was neither robust nor evidence-based but was based upon an assumption;</P><P>3. The changes have significantly altered the main outcomes and affected the interpretation of the review (i.e. changed one of the two main outcomes from an insignificant treatment effect to an inconsistent but broadly positive effect); and</P><P>4. The pre-planned analysis for fatigue at follow-up, has been omitted from the tables section of the review which, as far as I understand, is a unique omission for the primary outcomes.</P><P>For the sake of simplicity, rigour, and transparency, I ask the review team to reassess the review, including the decision to switch the primary outcomes, and to:</P><P>1. Amend the review as per the guidelines in the Cochrane Guidebook quoted above (i.e. "every effort should be made to adhere to a predetermined protocol"), and to revert to the pre-planned primary analyses; and</P><P>2. Clearly and unambiguously explain that all but one health indicator (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality of life, depression, and anxiety, but not sleep) demonstrated a non-significant outcome for pooled treatment effects at follow-up for exercise therapy versus passive control; and</P><P>3. Include a rigorous assessment of how the potential for bias may have affected outcomes of the open-label studies in this review, with consideration of the use of self-report measures in open-label studies.</P><P>--- ---</P><P><B>Appendix</B></P><P><B>Relevant Quotes from the Review</B></P><P><B>Differences between protocol and review</B></P><P>"[...] in the protocol it is stated, "where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of the same scale, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs)."

We have the greatest respect for your right to comment on and disagree with our work, but in the spirit of openness, transparency and mutual respect we must politely agree to disagree.</P><P>Presenting health statistics in a way that makes sense to the reader is a challenge. Statistical illiteracy is &#8211; according to Girgerenzer and co-workers &#8211; common in patients, journalists, and physicians (1). With this in mind we have presented the results as mean difference (MD) related to the relevant measurement scales, for example Chalder Fatigue Scale, as well as standardised mean difference (SMD). The use of MD enables the reader to transfer the results to the relevant measurement scale directly and judge the effect in relation to the scale. We disagree that presenting MD and SMD rather than SMD and MD is an important change, and we disagree with the claim that the analysis based on MD and SMD are inconsistent. This has been discussed as part of the peer-review process. Confidence intervals are probably a better way to interpret data that P values when borderline results are found (2). Interpreting the confidence intervals, we find it likely that exercise with its SMD on -0.63 (95% CI -1.32 to 0.06) is associated with a positive effect. Moreover, one should also keep in mind that the confidence interval of the SMD analysis are inflated by the inclusion of two studies that we recognize as outliers throughout our review.

Another section of the review ("What does evidence from the review tell us?") asserts that: "Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people&#8217;s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health." The "summary of main results" unequivocally states that: "A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment and at follow-up with respect to sleep (Analysis 1.12; Analysis 1.13), physical functioning (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15)." (Please see the appendix, below, to read these quotes in full.)</P><P>However, upon careful consideration of the relevant analyses, it seems that there were not consistent positive treatment effects for either physical function or overall health in relation to exercise therapy versus passive control. Instead, for both of these variables, there was a significant treatment effect only at end of treatment, but not at follow-up.</P><P>The relevant analyses are 1.5 (end of treatment) and 1.6 (follow-up) for self-report physical function, and 1.14 (end of treatment) and 1.15 (follow-up) for self-report overall health.</P><P>Analysis 1.5 assessed the pooled treatment effect on physical function at end of treatment for all eligible studies, and demonstrates a significant effect. Analysis 1.6 used the same criteria but at follow-up, and demonstrates that there was not a significant effect for physical function at follow-up.</P><P>Analysis 1.14 assessed the pooled treatment effect on overall health at end of treatment for all eligible studies, and demonstrates a significant effect. Analysis 1.15 used the same criteria but at follow-up, and demonstrates that there was not a significant effect for overall health at follow-up.</P><P>The lack of a significant treatment effect at follow-up is clearly illustrated by analyses 1.6 and 1.15.</P><P>These outcomes are also confirmed in the analysis section of the review where, in relation to the difference between exercise therapy versus passive control, for physical function at follow-up, it is confirmed that: "[...] little or no difference cannot be ruled out." And for overall health at follow-up, it is confirmed that "the confidence interval implies inconclusive results".</P><P>I believe that these outcome are not reflected accurately in the abstract, the main discussions or the conclusions of the review; specifically the extracts that are quoted above and in the appendix below. For example, the "summary of main results" specifically claims that positive treatment effects are demonstrated by analyses 1.6 and 1.15, but these analyses actually demonstrate an absence of significant treatment effects. The discussion claims: "A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed [...] at follow-up with respect to [...] physical functioning ([...]Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health ([...]Analysis 1.15)."</P><P>It is generally understood that a "positive" treatment effect equates to a significant effect, and I believe that the Cochrane text should reflect this, or at least clarify that the term "positive effect" is being used to indicate a lack of significance.</P><P>It is likely that many readers will not read the full report or scrutinise each individual analysis but will read only the abstract, main discussions or conclusions, so I believe it is important for the discussions to carefully and accurately reflect the outcomes of the analyses.</P><P>Cochrane has a reputation for upholding the highest standards including with respect to explaining outcomes in accurate and straightforward language. With this in mind, I request that the Cochrane review team kindly review the apparent disparities described above and amend the text of the discussions and conclusions where appropriate, in order to reflect the lack of a significant treatment effect for physical function and overall health at follow-up with respect to exercise therapy versus passive control.</P><P>---</P><P><B>Appendix</B></P><P><B>Quotes from the review:</B></P><P>Abstract &gt; Authors' conclusions</P><P>"Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes.

Without assessment of data concerning those whom have dropped out (those most likely to experience worsening symptoms) the conclusions you have stated could prove harmful if taken as encouragement for GPs to place their patients on GET regimes.</P><P>I do not question your analysis of the data, but rather I am concerned with the way in which you have expressed your findings.</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-10-05 18:02:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Thank you for your interest in the review and your comment.</P><P>In our systematic review, we aim to summarise the effect estimates associated with the use of exercise therapy for patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome CFS/ME. We decided to rely on data from randomised controlled trials (RCT), as RCTs provide much more robust data than for example anecdotal evidence. We held serious adverse reactions (SAR) and serious adverse events (SAE) as our primary outcome, whereas the drop-out rate was added as a secondary outcome.</P><P>Systematic reviews based on aggregated data dependent on the data reported in the included trials. One trial reported that SARs and SAEs were rare in both groups, suggesting that the difference between the groups is small when measured in absolute terms. Analysis of drop-out rates did not reveal statistical differences between the groups, and we cannot conclude that exercise is associated with higher drop-out rates. Even if we had seen differences between the groups, however, drop-out rates must be interpreted with caution. It is important to be aware that drop-out is not a direct measure of harm. There might be several reasons patients drop out, and some of these reasons are not expected to distribute equally between the groups. Harm is one possible reason for drop-out, but patients may also withdraw because they are unhappy with the randomisation (preconceptions), because they feel better or because they don&#8217;t experience the expected level of improvement etc.</P><P>Systematic reviews aim to bring the best evidence to the clinical encounter, but shared decision making includes patient preferences and clinical expertise when a treatment plan is decided upon.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2017-12-15 11:37:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Feedback submitted by: Richard Gardner</P><P>Response submitted by: Lillebeth Larun</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM></FEEDBACK><APPENDICES MODIFIED="2015-01-12 08:39:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><APPENDIX ID="APP-01" MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:32:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="1"><TITLE MODIFIED="2015-01-11 20:32:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Search strategy&#8212;CCDANCTR-References</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-31 13:40:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><B>CCDANCTR-References Register</B></P><P>(fatigue* or asthenia or &#8220;muscular disorder*&#8221; or neurasthenia* or &#8220;infectious mononucleos*&#8221; or &#8220;myalgic encephalomyelit*&#8221; or &#8220;royal free disease*&#8221; or lassitude or &#8220;muscular weakness*&#8221; or &#8220;akureyri disease&#8221; or &#8220;atypical poliomyelitis&#8221; or CFIDS or CFS or (chronic and mononucleos*) or &#8220;epidemic neuromyasthenia&#8221; or &#8220;iceland disease&#8221; or &#8220;post infectious encephalomyelitis&#8221; or PVFS or tiredness or adynamia or legasthenia or (perspective and asthenia) or neurataxia or (&#8220;muscle strength&#8221; and loss) or &#8220;muscle* weak*&#8221; or &#8220;weak* muscle*&#8221; or (muscular and insufficiency) or (neuromuscular and fatigue))</P><P>and</P><P>exercise or &#8220;physical fitness&#8221; or "physical education&#8221; or &#8220;physical condition*&#8221; or &#8220;physical train*&#8221; or &#8220;physical mobility&#8221; or &#8220;physical activ*&#8221; or &#8220;physical exertion&#8221; or &#8220;physical effort*&#8221; or (breathing and (therap* or exercise*)) or (respiration and therap*) or &#8220;gi gong&#8221; or gigong or *kung or tai or thai or taiji or taijiquan or taichi or walking or yoga or relaxation* or gymnastics or calisthenics or aerobic or danc* or jumping or hopping or running or jogging or ambulat* or &#8220;muscle strengthening&#8221; or (muscular and (strength or resistance)) or ((weight or weights) and lifting) or weightlifting or &#8220;power lifting&#8221; or &#8220;weight train*&#8221; or pilates or stretching or plyometric* or &#8220;cardiopulmonary conditioning&#8221; or &#8220;motion therap*&#8221; or &#8220;neuromuscular facilitation*&#8221; or &#8220;movement therap*&#8221; or ((recreation or activity) and therap*) or &#8220;isometric training&#8221; or climbing or cycling or bicycle* or &#8220;lifting effort*&#8221; or swim* or (training and (technical or course or program*)) or writing or kinesi* or gardening or multiconvergent)</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-02" MODIFIED="2015-01-12 08:39:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2014-10-31 13:40:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Other search strategies</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-12 08:39:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><B>SPORTDiscus</B> (EBSCOHost)</P><P>1. exp Exercise/</P><P>2. exp Exercise Therapy/</P><P>3. exp Exercise Movement Techniques/</P><P>4.
