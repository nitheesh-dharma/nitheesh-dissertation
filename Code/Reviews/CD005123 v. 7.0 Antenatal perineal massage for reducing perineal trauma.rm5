<P>Antenatal perineal massage helps reduce both perineal trauma during birth and pain afterwards.</P>
<P>Most women are keen to give birth without perineal tears, cuts and stitches, as these often cause pain and discomfort afterwards, and this can impact negatively on sexual functioning. Perineal massage during the last month of pregnancy has been suggested as a possible way of enabling the perineal tissue to expand more easily during birth. The review of four trials (2497 women) showed that perineal massage, undertaken by the woman or her partner (for as little as once or twice a week from 35 weeks), reduced the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and ongoing perineal pain. The impact was clear for women who had not given birth vaginally before, but was less clear for women who had. Women should be informed about the benefits of digital antenatal perineal massage.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four trials (2497 women) comparing digital perineal massage with control. All were of good quality. Antenatal digital perineal massage was associated with an overall reduction in the incidence of trauma requiring suturing (four trials, 2480 women, risk ratio (RR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 0.96), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 15 (10 to 36)) and women practicing perineal massage were less likely to have an episiotomy (four trials, 2480 women, RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.95), NNTB 21 (12 to 75)). These findings were significant for women without previous vaginal birth only. No differences were seen in the incidence of first- or second-degree perineal tears or third-/fourth-degree perineal trauma. Only women who have previously birthed vaginally reported a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pain at three months postpartum (one trial, 376 women, RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.87) NNTB 13 (7 to 60)). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of instrumental deliveries, sexual satisfaction, or incontinence of urine, faeces or flatus for any women who practised perineal massage compared with those who did not massage.</P>

<P>Antenatal digital perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and the reporting of ongoing perineal pain, and is generally well accepted by women. As such, women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Genital tract trauma</HEADING>
<P>Trauma to the genital tract commonly accompanies vaginal birth. Perineal trauma is classified as first degree (involving the fourchette, perineal skin and vaginal mucous membrane), second degree (involving the fascia and muscle of the perineal body), third degree (involving the anal sphincter) and fourth degree (involving the rectal mucosa) (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1997</LINK>). Genital tract trauma can result from episiotomies (incision to enlarge vaginal opening), spontaneous tears or both. Although in some countries the frequency of episiotomy has declined in recent years, overall rates of trauma remain high. There is considerable variation in the reported rates of perineal trauma because of inconsistency in definitions and reporting practices. In studies of restrictive use of episiotomy, 51% to 77% of women still sustained trauma that was considered to be sufficiently extensive to require suturing (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayerhofer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayerhofer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCandlish 1998</LINK>). Even in a home birth setting, approximately 30% of women experience some degree of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1998</LINK>). Rates of trauma are especially high in women having their first baby (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Morbidity associated with perineal trauma</HEADING>
<P>Perineal trauma can be associated with significant short-term and long-term morbidity. Most women experience perineal pain or discomfort in the first few days after a vaginal birth. Of those women who sustain perineal trauma, 40% report pain in the first two weeks postpartum, up to 20% still have pain at eight weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>), and 7% to 9% report pain at three months (<LINK REF="REF-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCandlish 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1987</LINK>). Women giving birth with an intact perineum, however, report pain less frequently at one, two, 10 and 90 days postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perineal pain or discomfort is common and may impair normal sexual functioning. Dyspareunia (painful sex) following vaginal delivery is reported by 60% of women at three months, 30% at six months (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2000</LINK>) and 15% still experience painful sex up to three years later (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1987</LINK>). Trauma to the perineum has been associated with dyspareunia during the first three months after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2000</LINK>). Women with an intact perineum (compared with those who have experienced perineal trauma) are more likely to resume intercourse earlier, report less pain with first sexual intercourse, report greater satisfaction with sexual experience (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>), and report greater sexual sensation and likelihood of orgasm at six months postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Signorello-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Signorello 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women giving birth to their first baby with an intact perineum have stronger pelvic floors (measured by electromyogram) and make quicker muscle recovery than those women suffering spontaneous tears or episiotomies (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>). Perineal trauma has not, however, been clearly associated with urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Woolley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolley 1995</LINK>). Anal sphincter or mucosal injuries are identified following 3% to 4% of all vaginal births. This rate is not reduced by a policy of restrictive use of episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 1999</LINK>). Alarmingly, one-third of those women who are recognised will suffer some degree of incontinence of faeces (from mild to severe) following primary repair (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2002</LINK>). An estimated 35% of primiparas have ultrasound scan evidence of third- or fourth-degree trauma that is unrecognised at delivery and presumably associated with vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no evidence that birthing practices that aim to reduce perineal trauma are correlated with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. Restrictive use of episiotomy results in less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 1999</LINK>). Episiotomy does not reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage in low-birthweight babies (<LINK REF="REF-Woolley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolley 1995</LINK>), and allowing a longer second stage (and potentially avoiding perineal trauma), has not been shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Menticoglou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menticoglou 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Factors associated with perineal trauma</HEADING>
<P>Numerous factors related to the woman or the care she receives have been suggested as potentially affecting the occurrence of genital tract trauma. Perineal trauma is more likely in nulliparas, and is more likely with increasing fetal head diameter and weight, and with malposition (<LINK REF="REF-Mayerhofer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayerhofer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nodine-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nodine 1987</LINK>). As mentioned, restrictive use of episiotomy is associated with less perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 1999</LINK>), as is the use of vacuum extraction for instrumental deliveries as opposed to forceps (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1999</LINK>). There is no clear consensus about the role of perineal guarding (<LINK REF="REF-Mayerhofer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayerhofer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCandlish 1998</LINK>), active directed pushing (<LINK REF="REF-Parnell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnell 1993</LINK>), maternal position (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2003</LINK>) or the use of perineal massage during second stage (<LINK REF="REF-Stamp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamp 2001</LINK>) in reducing the incidence of perineal trauma. There is a lack of evidence to associate induction of labour with perineal trauma and only retrospective studies which suggest an association between accoucheur type and perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Bodner_x002d_Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodner-Adler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shorten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorten 2002</LINK>). In the event of a perineal injury which requires suturing, a continuous subcuticular technique compared with interrupted sutures has been associated with less pain postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Preventing perineal trauma</HEADING>
<P>The potential morbidity associated with vaginal birth is concerning. It is possible that this is contributing to the increase in requests for caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Mufti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Mufti 1997</LINK>). Considering these factors, any method proven to reduce the likelihood of sustaining genital tract trauma (and therefore delivery-associated morbidity) is to be commended. Preventing even some of this childbirth trauma is likely to benefit large numbers of women. It may also result in cost savings in terms of less suturing, drugs and analgesics. Some have advocated the use of perineal massage antenatally in decreasing the incidence of perineal trauma during vaginal birth. It is proposed that perineal massage may increase the flexibility of the perineal muscles and therefore, decrease muscular resistance, which would enable the perineum to stretch at delivery without tearing or needing episiotomy. Our aim is to investigate the role of antenatal digital perineal massage and its effect upon the incidence and morbidity associated with perineal trauma.</P>

<P>All included trials of digital perineal massage were of good quality. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible for any of the studies to blind participants to the intervention. The trials all recommended a similar technique of digital perineal massage which was undertaken at a similar gestation. The authors all instructed participants not to inform their birth attendant of their allocation and some attempt was made by authors of three of the four included studies to ensure adequate blinding of outcome assessment was upheld. The three month follow-up questionnaire was returned by 79% of trial participants (with similar response rates from women in the massage and control groups).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-15 11:55:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women who practise digital perineal massage from approximately 35 weeks' gestation are less likely to have perineal trauma which requires suturing in association with vaginal birth. For every 15 women who practise digital perineal massage antenatally, one fewer will receive perineal suturing following the birth. There is no difference in the proportion of women who incur first- or second-degree perineal tears or third/fourth degree perineal trauma comparing those who massage with controls. There is, however, a statistically significant 16% reduction in the incidence of episiotomies in women who practise digital perineal massage. Thus the reduction in perineal trauma requiring suturing following vaginal birth is almost entirely due to the fact that she is less likely to have an episiotomy. These reductions are significant for the subgroup of women who have never previously had a vaginal birth. There is no statistical difference in these outcomes for women who have previously birthed vaginally; however, only one included trial studied this group of women.</P>
<P>For the subgroup of women who have previously had a vaginal birth, antenatal perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal pain at three months in the sole study that assessed this outcome. The women who massage the most frequently are the least likely to report ongoing perineal pain postpartum. We proposed that this reduction in perineal pain at three months was because women who practise perineal massage are less likely to have an episiotomy and that having had an episiotomy is the most likely reason for ongoing pain. However, when we analysed the data excluding women who had episiotomies, this effect remained. In other words, for women who have had a previous vaginal birth, antenatal perineal massage appears to result in less reporting of perineal pain at three months even for those women who do not have an episiotomy. Women who massage the most frequently may not be able to further reduce their chance of an episiotomy but may lessen their likelihood of perineal pain at three months.</P>
<P>No significant differences are observed in the incidence of instrumental deliveries, sexual satisfaction, or incontinence of urine, faeces or flatus for any women who practise perineal massage compared with those who do not massage in the study that reported these outcomes.</P>
<P>Surprisingly the reduction in the incidence of episiotomy and of perineal trauma requiring suturing is not more pronounced in the women who massage the most frequently. It is also an unexpected finding that the subgroup of women who massage the most frequently have the longest second stage. If the reason that perineal massage works is that it increases the flexibility and decreases the resistance of the perineal muscles and soft tissues, then it would be anticipated that the most diligent massager should have the least chance of needing suturing and have a relatively short second stage. As this effect was not seen, there may be other reasons that women who practise perineal massage are less likely to incur perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) that requires suturing. The decision regarding if and when an episiotomy is cut is a subjective one. We therefore considered the adequacy of blinding. We also considered the possibility that women who were instructed in perineal massage became very motivated to achieve a vaginal birth with an intact perineum and consequently, may have been more likely to want to keep pushing longer and oppose an episiotomy unless it was clearly necessary.</P>
<P>We proceeded to exclude women who had an episiotomy and reassess length of second stage (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). No significant differences were seen in the length of second stage after excluding women who had an episiotomy. If birth attendants were unblinded, we propose that after excluding episiotomies, the remaining women in the massage group would still have been encouraged to push longer while those in the control group would have had an overall shorter second stage (as the controls who avoided episiotomy likely delivered quickly). The net effect would therefore be an overall increase in the length of second stage when compared with controls. As this effect was not seen, we considered it less likely that unblinding occurred.</P>
<P>If the motivation of the informed woman for an intact perineum explains the reduction in trauma, then those who massaged the most frequently would likely have had the longest second stage (as was seen). Further, women in the control group who were less informed and motivated about preventing perineal trauma, may have been less likely to push for as long and more receptive to an episiotomy if suggested. By excluding women who had episiotomies, the time spent pushing for women who practise perineal massage should be reduced (particularly for the subgroup of women who massaged the most frequently). When this analysis was performed we did see a reduction in the length of second stage in this subgroup. This weighs against the supposition that perineal massage reduces the incidence of episiotomy because of increased flexibility of the perineum. Nevertheless, it appears that women who are instructed in perineal massage (either because they become more informed about birthing, episiotomies and the advantages of an intact perineum, or because of the act of massaging itself) are less likely to have an episiotomy, require perineal suturing or report ongoing perineal pain postpartum.</P>
<P>Most women find the practice of perineal massage acceptable and believe it helps them prepare for birth (<LINK REF="REF-Labrecque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrecque 2001</LINK>). (Details regarding the technique of perineal massage as described by Labrecque and Shipman are provided under <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Women comment that in the first few weeks massage can be uncomfortable, unpleasant and even produce a painful or burning sensation. Most women report that the pain and burning sensation has decreased or gone by the second or third week of massage. The majority (79%) report they would massage again and 87% would recommend it to another pregnant woman. Most women considered their partner's participation as positive.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-19 11:54:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Perineal trauma is associated with significant postpartum morbidity. Antenatal digital perineal massage from approximately 35 weeks' gestation reduces the incidence of perineal trauma requiring suturing (mainly episiotomies) and women are less likely to report perineal pain at three months postpartum (regardless of whether or not an episiotomy was performed). Although there is some transient discomfort in the first few weeks, it is generally well accepted by women. As such, women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-19 11:54:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are reasonable data supporting the reduction in perineal trauma requiring suturing in women who practise antenatal perineal massage. The reported outcomes of perineal pain, sexual satisfaction and incontinence are however based on one study and such findings need confirmation. More data are also needed regarding women who have previously had a vaginal birth before reaching conclusions about the effect of perineal massage on perineal trauma in this group. </P>

<P>We considered for inclusion all studies identified by the search strategy outlined above. Both review authors independently evaluated trials under consideration for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results. Any differences of opinion were resolved by open discussion. We recorded and reported in the review the reasons for excluding trials. Both review authors independently entered the extracted data into Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We performed statistical analyses using Review Manager.</P>
<P>We assessed included trial data as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We described methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence for each trial.<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Selection bias (allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:</P>
<P>(A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as: telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;</P>
<P>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation, such as: list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;</P>
<P>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation, such as: open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up using the following criteria:</P>
<P>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;</P>
<P>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;</P>
<P>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;</P>
<P>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
<P>For dichotomous data we calculated the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled the results using a fixed-effect model. For continuous data we used mean differences and 95% CI. We evaluated statistical heterogeneity by a visual inspection of forest plots and using the I² statistic as calculated in 'RevMan Analyses'. We detected no significant heterogeneity (I² statistic greater than 50%) in any of the outcome measures.</P>
<P>We attempted to undertake the following subgroup analyses:<BR/>(a) women with previous vaginal birth versus without previous vaginal birth;<BR/>(b) digital perineal massage versus massaging device;<BR/>(c) daily perineal massage versus less frequent perineal massage.</P>

<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult the third review author.</P>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult the third review author. Data will be entered into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and checked for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see</I> Sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Their<I> </I>sample sizes or standard errors will be adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Cross-over trials will be excluded from this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition will be noted. The impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses will be carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if I² is greater than 50% and either T² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identify substantial heterogeneity (above 50%), we will explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.  If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of T² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>women with previous vaginal birth versus without previous vaginal birth;</LI>
<LI>digital perineal massage versus massaging device;</LI>
<LI>daily perineal massage versus less frequent perineal massage.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Subgroup analyses will be conducted on all the review's outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess differences between subgroups by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We plan to carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any difference to the overall result.</P>
