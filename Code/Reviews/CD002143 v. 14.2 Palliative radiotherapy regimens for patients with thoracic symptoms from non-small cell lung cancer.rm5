<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-31 09:59:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review Question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the best way to give radiotherapy to patients with incurable lung cancer. What doses give the best balance between symptom control and side effects? Does giving more radiotherapy improve the chance of a patient being alive in one or two years?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In most developed countries lung cancer is one of the commonest tumours. Only 10 to 20% of patients can have surgery with a chance of cure. For many of the rest radiotherapy to the chest is used to relieve symptoms of cough, breathlessness and pain. The number of radiotherapy treatments given and the dose of each treatment varies widely around the world. Since the late 1980s, many trials have tried to answer which is the best radiotherapy schedule to relieve symptoms without causing too many side-effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Fourteen trials, including 3576 patients, were found that compared at least two different radiotherapy regimens. All involved patients with incurable lung cancer but the extent of the cancer and the fitness of the patients varied between the studies making direct comparisons difficult.The radiotherapy regimens in the trials varied from a single treatment to thirty treatments over six weeks.This update found no new trials and a meta-analysis (pooling the results of all trials) was carried out to see whether giving higher doses of radiation resulted in longer survival. </P>
<P>All trials reported how long patients lived after their treatment and looked at the effect on symptoms as well as recording side-effects. However, the trials did not use the same methods for recording symptoms and side effects with some using the doctor's assessment and some using the patient's, making direct comparison difficult.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>This review shows that for most patients, a short course of radiotherapy with only one or two visits, improves common symptoms as effectively as longer courses, without more side effects. There is no strong evidence to support the view that a longer course of radiotherapy may give a better chance of living for one or two years, but it does result in more immediate side effects, especially sore swallowing.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All the trials were randomised meaning patients involved in the study had an equal chance of getting either treatment. The use of a doctor's assessment of the patient's symptoms in some studies may have led to an under-estimation of the symptoms.</P>

<P>Palliative radiotherapy to the chest is often used in patients with lung cancer, but radiotherapy regimens are more often based on tradition than research results. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and previously updated in 2006.</P>

<P>The two objectives of this review were:</P>

<P>The electronic databases MEDLINE (1966 - Jan 2014), EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and discussion with experts were used to identify potentially eligible trials, published and unpublished.</P>
<P>Two authors (FM and RS) independently identified all studies that may be suitable for inclusion in the review.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-12-31 10:26:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reviewers assessed search results independently and possible studies were highlighted and the full text obtained. Data were extracted and attempts were made to contact the original authors for missing information.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was improvement in major thoracic symptoms (degree and duration). Secondary outcome measures were short and long term toxicities, effect on quality of life and overall survival.</P>
<P>Patient reported outcomes were reported descriptively. Quantitative data such as survival and toxicity were analysed as dichotomous variables and reported using relative risks (RR).</P>
<P>For this update of the review a meta-analysis of the survival data was carried out.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-31 10:28:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen randomised controlled trials (3576 patients) were included, with no new studies added in this update.</P>
<P>There were important differences in the doses of radiotherapy investigated, the patient characteristics including disease stage and performance status and the outcome measures.The doses of RT investigated ranged from 10 Gy in 1 fraction (10Gy/1F) to 60 Gy/30F over six weeks, with a total of 19 different dose/ fractionation regimens.</P>
<P>Potential biases were identified in some studies. Methods of randomisation, assessment of symptoms and statistical methods used were unclear in some papers. Withdrawal and drop-outs were accounted for in all but one study.</P>
<P>All 13 studies that investigated symptoms reported that major thoracic symptoms improved following RT.There is no strong evidence that any regimen gives greater palliation. Higher dose regimens may give more acute toxicity and some regimens are associated with an increased risk of radiation myelitis. Variation in reporting of toxicities, in particular the absence of clear grading, means results of the meta-analysis should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of overall survival broken down by performance status, a key variable, is included in this update. Further information was sought from all the original authors if stratified data was not included in the original publication. Three published studies contained sufficient data and seven authors were able to provide further information which represented 1992 patients (56% of all patients). The absence of data for nearly half of the patients has affected the quality of evidence.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in 1-year overall survival between regimens with fewer radiotherapy fractions compared with regimens with more when patients were stratified by performance status. The results of the meta-analysis of 1-year overall survival for patients with good performance status (WHO performance status 0-1) showed moderately high heterogeneity and a summary result was not thought meaningful. The results of 1-year overall survival for patients with poor performance status was RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; moderate quality of evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-31 10:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Radiotherapy for patients with incurable non-small cell lung cancer can improve thoracic symptoms. Care should be taken with the dose to the spinal cord to reduce the risk of radiation myelopathy. The higher dose, more fractionated palliative radiotherapy regimens do not provide better or more durable palliation and their use to prolong survival is not supported by strong evidence. More research is needed into reducing the acute toxicity of large fraction regimens and into the role of radical compared to high dose palliative radiotherapy. In the future, large trials comparing different RT regimens may be difficult to set up because of the increasing use of systemic chemotherapy. Trials looking at how best to integrate these two modalities, particularly in good PS patients, need to be carried out.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-23 10:06:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lung cancer is one of the commonest malignant tumours for both men and women in developed countries and an increasing problem in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2000</LINK>). The majority of patients (66% to 74.3% in the most recent UK National Lung Cancer Audit; <LINK REF="REF-NLCA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLCA 2013</LINK>) have non-small cell lung cancer (squamous cell, adeno- and large cell undifferentiated carcinomas), of whom only 15 to 25% will have tumours that are potentially curable. The remainder are thought incurable, either because of the extent of local tumour, poor medical fitness of the patient or because of known metastases.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-10 16:51:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Radiotherapy (RT) to the primary tumour in the chest has been used to treat patients for many years. Although high dose, radical RT can be used in a small number of patients with the intention of long term disease control or cure, it is more often used in lower doses with the aim of controlling (palliating) troublesome local symptoms, most commonly cough, haemoptysis, chest pain and breathlessness. It is therefore an important treatment in the overall management of patients with this common disease. Estimates of clinical practice in the UK suggest that the treatment of lung cancer constitutes 20-25% of radiation oncologists' time, 90% of treatments are palliative (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 1993</LINK>) and that around 20% -30% of patients with lung cancer get palliative RT (<LINK REF="REF-Thorogood-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorogood 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-23 10:07:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The dose regimens for palliative RT evolved empirically from clinical experience and surveys in Europe and the USA in the early 1990s showed widespread variation in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 1992</LINK>). However the regimens were not subject to rigorous evaluation in clinical trials until the late 1980s and 1990s.</P>
<P>Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are increasingly being treated first with chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-NSLCCG-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSLCCG 1995</LINK>). Nevertheless, palliative RT is still an important treatment option for patients who are symptomatic either because they have not responded to chemotherapy, have relapsed, or have contra-indications to potentially toxic drugs. However, it has not yet been clearly established which RT regimens give the most benefit and least toxicity. The effect of varying radiotherapy regimens on survival is also not clearly established but a published meta-analysis concluded that improvement in survival favoured high dose radiotherapy although patients were more likely to experience toxicity and would require a greater investment of time.(<LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2008</LINK>) It is important to try and identify any sub-groups who may benefit from longer duration of treatment.</P>

Three independent reviewers (RS, FM, ET) assessed the included trials for methodological quality using guidelines set out in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-10 17:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RS assessed the risk of bias using the domains suggested in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other biases). Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias when true randomisation occurred, when there was blinding of assessors to treatment received, when patient reported outcome measures were assessed using patient diaries, when all patients were accounted for and included in the analysis on an intention to treat basis and when all outcome measures are reported. Other factors that may produce bias such as use of chemotherapy and percentage of patients with histological confirmation of lung cancer were also assessed. No attempt at concealing the bibliographical details during risk of bias assessment was made as many of the studies were well known to the reviewers. FM then reviewed the risk of bias assessment and if there was disagreement, further discussions were held to reach a consensus. Risk of bias is summarised in the results section and presented as a risk of bias table.</P>

<P>Treatment effect can be divided into two main groups, quantitative and patient reported outcomes.</P>
<P>Quantitative data such as survival and toxicity were analysed as dichotomous variables and expressed using relative risks (RR). It was unlikely that suitable time to event data would be available to analyse survival as a continuous variable. Adverse events were analysed as absent or present as most reports did not provide sufficient data to allow analysis of toxicity scores as ordinal variables.</P>

<P>Clinical diversity was assessed by documenting the patient groups represented in each study focusing on key factors such as histological confirmation of diagnosis, age, disease stage and performance status. Methodological diversity was assessed by documenting trial design, in particular focusing on radiotherapy dose and fractionation and the assessment methods of tumour response and symptoms. Heterogeneity of quantitative data was assessed by calculating I<SUP>2</SUP>. I<SUP>2 </SUP>values were interpreted using the guide in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 75% to 100% are likely to represent considerable heterogeneity, values between 50% and 90% are likely to represent substantial heterogeneity, values between 30% and 60% are likely to represent moderate heterogeneity and values between 0% and 40% might not be important) and correlated with the data on clinical and methodological diversity.</P>

<P>The clinical differences between the trials identified in the original review meant that meta-analysis was only likely to produce useful results if sub-group analysis was possible. The method of staging was not specified in many of the papers and it was felt that many patients may have been understaged due to lack of cross-sectional imaging which would introduce bias. For this reason, sub-group analysis by tumour stage was not attempted.</P>
<P>Performance status scores are clearly defined, easily assessed and have not altered in the time period covered by the published studies. They are known to have an impact on prognosis in advanced stage NSCLC and it was felt to be a suitable variable for sub-group analysis. Attempts were made to contact all the authors of the studies to get further information on survival in the sub-groups PS 0-1 and PS 2-4. For those studies that used the Karnofsky score, a conversion was made with Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 80 being considered as PS 0-1.</P>

</P>
<P>A total of 3708 patients were randomised in these RCTs, of whom 3576 were evaluable and reported.</P>
<P>Eleven studies had two-way comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>)and three had three arms (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>). In one three-arm study (<LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>) the third arm was 'delayed' RT, given when the patients became symptomatic. Data from this arm are shown in the table of characteristics of included studies, but were not used in drawing conclusions on effectiveness or toxicity.</P>
<P>The doses of RT investigated ranged from 10 Gy in 1 fraction (10Gy/1F) to 60 Gy/30Fover six weeks, with a total of 19 different dose/ fractionation regimens. The biologically equivalent doses for acute reacting tissues (BED10), for carcinoma cells (BED25) and spinal cord (BED1.7) as suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK> are presented for comparison in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>) was one arm of the study a dose (60 Gy in 30 fractions) that would be normally considered as 'radical' and potentially curative, with a BED10 in excess of 70 Gy.</P>
<P>The studies included slightly different patient groups. The majority included only patients with histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>) included 19% of patients in whom a histological diagnosis had not been made. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) included a few patients with small cell lung cancer (3% and 6% respectively). Another (<LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>) included 2 patients with bronchial carcinoid tumours. Inclusion of these patients is unlikely to influence the assessment of palliation or toxicity but might affect the survival results.</P>
<P>More important is the performance status (PS) of the patients. PS is a well known major determinant of prognosis in these patients. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS scale scores patients 0 to 4, with 0 being the best and 4 the worst score for living patients.Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>) specifically included patients with poor PS (ECOG 2 or worse). <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> included ECOG PS 3 to 4 patients, or PS 0 to 2 patients with metastatic disease. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>) only included patients with better PS (ECOG 0-2), while four (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>) included patients with any PS. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>) excluded patients with PS 0, and two studies excluded PS 4 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Age data are reported differently in different studies. All but one (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>) which excluded those over 75 years, included patients of any age. But the age ranges do seem to be different. <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK> did not exclude older patients, but only 43% of the population were over 60. In contrast, the five British studies (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) had between 59% and 77% of patients over 65 years. Although age has not been shown to be an independent prognostic factor, it may reflect co-morbidity and give information about case selection.</P>
<P>Finally, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>) included patients who were asymptomatic, because in one arm of the trial RT was only given when the patients were, or became symptomatic. This arm addresses a different research question. Again it seemed reasonable to include data from the two 'immediate RT' arms in the comparative assessment of survival benefit.</P>
<P>Different outcomes were measured and reported in these studies. All reported survival as an outcome, although in the context of a palliative treatment this may be less important than the measurement of symptom control and quality of life (QOL).</P>
<P>The assessment of symptoms, both tumour related and treatment toxicity, as part of a RCT is difficult and the methodology for collecting and analysing the data have evolved and been validated during the time period of these trials (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fayers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fayers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montazeri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montazeri 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopwood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopwood 1994</LINK>). There was no standard methodology for assessing symptoms and their change with time, nor for interpreting the data.</P>
<P>Seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>) used the most thorough and systematic symptom assessment, with records of both the clinicians' and patients' assessment at each time point using validated instruments. The MRC studies also pioneered the use of daily diary cards (<LINK REF="REF-Fayers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fayers 1991</LINK>) which gave particular insights into the time course of radiation oesophagitis and other acute symptoms following treatment. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>) used only patient questionnaires. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) appear to have relied entirely on the clinicians' assessment of symptoms, which has been shown to underestimate symptoms compared to the patients' own assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK> did not specifically assess symptoms and only assessed tumour response radiologically.</P>
<P>Three studies reported QOL outcomes using validated tools (<LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK> used the patient-completed Spitzer QOL index at baseline and after RT. <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> used the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and EORTC QOL questionnaire-lung cancer-specific module (LC13) at baseline, 2 and 6 weeks after RT and 8-weekly thereafter up to 54 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> used QLQ-C30 and the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) at baseline at 1 month after RT.</P>
<P>It is therefore clear that these 14 studies are heterogeneous in the dose regimens compared, in the age and PS of the patients recruited and in the way in which key outcomes were assessed and reported. As a result in previous versions of this review formal meta-analysis of the numerical data was felt to be inappropriate and only narrative synthesis was attempted. However for this update we decided to attempt a meta-analysis and to explore heterogeneity more formally.</P>
<P>Further information on 1 year survival by performance status and treatment arm was sought from the corresponding authors in 2011 to allow sub-group analysis. <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> were able to provide additional data and <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> had sufficient data in the published data. These have been included in the meta-analysis.(<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) This represents 1992 patients out of a total of 3576 patients (56%).</P>
<P>The authors were satisfied that these papers had robust follow-up with virtually no patients lost to follow-up. The length of time since original publication meant there was insufficient data to do a time-to event analysis but data was obtained for survival at 1 year broken down by performance status and treatment received.</P>
<P>One year survival was analysed as a dichotomous variable using a random effects model (high levels of heterogeneity). Two year survival was not analysed because of the extremely small number of survivors at 2 years.</P>
<P>The published meta-analysis <LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2008</LINK> attempted to calculate a biological equivalent dose (BED) for each of the radiotherapy regimens used and compare the effect of higher BED on survival. This approach led to difficulties in some comparisons when the BED was calculated to be similar in each arm. Instead, we divided the radiotherapy regimens into more fractionated or less fractionated regimens to test the hypothesis that more fractionated regimes may result in higher survival at one year.</P>

<P>Studies were assessed for risk of bias in the following categories: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential biases such as method of assessing symptoms, method of assessing tumour response,use of chemotherapy, rates of histological confirmation of diagnosis and inclusion of other lung cancer types. See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. None of the studies concealed the treatment given from the patients or treating physicians. This is standard in radiotherapy trials when concealment of allocation is difficult and prescription of radiotherapy is heavily regulated. For this reason, assessment of blinding of participants is not included in the risk of bias table. It was felt that blinding of treatment received was unlikely to affect bias when considering survival data.</P>
<P>All the studies included in this review were prospective randomised studies. The method of randomisation was not always clearly stated. The entry criteria and treatment options (including adequate technical details of the RT regimens) were clearly stated in all studies.</P>
<P>There were five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) in which there was a discrepancy between the numbers of patients randomised and those evaluated for outcomes. Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> included all patients in the survival analyses although not in other outcome measures.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>, although 409 patients were randomised, only 316 were included in the final analysis. 45% of the patients that were excluded had been allocated to treatment but failed to complete the treatment due to failing health or patient choice. These should have been included in an intention to treat analysis.</P>
<P>A smaller percentage of patients were excluded from the analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>. In this study, 291 patients were randomised but only 273 were included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if they refused treatment before or early after the commencement of radiation without apparent reason. Patients who died during treatment were included in the survival analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>, follow-up data were not available on 23 of the 149 patients initially randomised. This was due to death before follow-up (19), missing data forms (2) and failure of patients to attend follow-up (2). All patients were included in the survival calculations with the exception of a single patient whose initial assessment form was missing.</P>
<P>In none of the studies was it reported that the clinicians who assessed response were blind to the allocation of treatment.</P>
<P>Two studies included patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 6% of patients in <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK> had SCLC but these were evenly distributed between the two treatment arms and unlikely to introduce bias.3% of patients in <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK> had SCLC and all these patients were in the two fraction arm, leading to possible bias. In addition, 19% of patients in <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK> did not have a histological diagnosis.</P>
<P>The methods of symptom assessment and toxicity varied between studies in detail and quality. The use of physician assessment of symptoms and toxicities could lead to under-estimation. Physician assessment was used in <LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK> and the method of assessing symptoms was not stated in <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>. Grading of symptoms was inconsistent across the studies with some using common toxicity criteria grades, others describing toxicities in terms of mild/moderate/severe and some only reporting the presence or absence of toxicity.</P>
<P>Tumour radiological response was reported in 6 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>) In all trials the standard terminology of complete response, partial response (greater than 50% reduction in tumour), stable disease (less than 50% reduction in tumour) and progressive disease was used. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK> the definition of response was either described or references to standardised criteria were made e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>
</P>
<P>The methods of statistical analysis were fully or partly described in all studies. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method in all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK> where the precise method was not stated.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Improvement of Major Thoracic Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>All 13 studies that investigated symptoms reported that major thoracic symptoms improved following RT. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) reported a difference in symptom control between regimens tested. In <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>, the higher dose and more fractionated regimen (45 Gy/18F) appeared to give significantly better palliation. It is not entirely clear how symptoms were assessed in this trial but it appears to have been solely by doctors. The definition of partial response "reduced severity or frequency for one or more of the pre-treatment thoracic symptoms without concurrent emergence of new intrathoracic symptoms" is also imprecise. Of the 291 patients randomised, only 237 were included in the response assessment because of either defaulting (18) or dying (36) before the end of RT. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) also reported better palliation with the higher dose, more fractionated regimen. In <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>, changes on the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) showed that 20Gy/5F resulted in significant improvement in symptoms related to lung cancer. In <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>, the 30Gy/10F regimen was significantly better at reducing chest pain and dyspnoea compared to 10Gy/1F. In addition, a significant improvement in PS and less patient-scored anxiety was reported with the 30Gy/10F regimen, but it is not clear if this was compared to 10Gy/1F or to the pre-treatment baseline readings.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK> the shorter (2 fraction) regimen appeared to have a more rapid onset of effect in palliating symptoms than the longer, higher dose, 13 fraction regimen, although the differences in the proportion of patients with various symptoms who were palliated were not significant.</P>
<P>The duration of symptom control is a difficult endpoint to define and record. Only one trial showed a significant difference between the regimens investigated (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>). This trial showed both regimens were effective in controlling symptoms, but the duration of palliative effect was significantly longer with 30Gy/10F compared to 16Gy/2F.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>, palliation seemed to last at least 50% of the survival time. <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK> noted that only one symptom, haemoptysis, was improved in more than 50% of patients at eight weeks but that relief of other symptoms was "disappointing in both degree and duration".</P>
<P>In summary, all the studies showed a beneficial effect of RT on thoracic symptoms due to lung cancer, but there is no strong evidence to support the view that higher dose are associated with better or longer lasting palliation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>) reported no difference in QOL outcomes between the regimens tested. In <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>, the LCSS scores reported significantly better global QOL with 20Gy/5F compared to 10Gy/1F (mean change in global QOL lung cancer symptom scale score at 1 month -0.51 in 5 fraction arm compared with 8.23 in 1 fraction arm, p=0.039) . Using QLQ-C30 however, there was no difference in QOL between the two regimens tested except for a statistically significant improvement in pain scores with 20Gy/5F(mean change in QLQ-C30 pain score at 1 month -9.22 in 5 fraction arm compared with 2.94 in single fraction arm, p=0.04). <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> reported reduced physical and social functioning with 17Gy/2F compared to 50Gy/25F at week two (QLQ-C30 score 57 for 17Gy compared with 63 for 50Gy, p&lt;0.01) although this difference did not persist, and more emesis and appetite loss with 42Gy/15F compared to 50Gy/25F at two weeks (QLQ-C30 score for emesis 15 for 42Gy compared with 11 for 50Gy, p&lt;0.01, QLQ-C30 score for appetite loss 48 for 42Gy compared with 34 for 50Gy, p&lt;0.01).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>The acute side effects of RT to the chest, in particular radiation oesophagitis, tiredness and acute pneumonitis, are well recognised. These were reported as generally mild (Grade 1 or 2) for the majority of patients in all of the trials.Toxicity data is reported differently in the papers with some only reporting severe toxicity rates (i.e. WHO grade 3-4) and some reporting any grade. Some papers do not give numerical values for toxicities, merely reporting them as similar in both arms. Given these limitations, the forest plots for adverse events <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; Figure 5; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; should be interpreted with caution. Although these have failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in reports of adverse events there is high chance of bias from under-reporting as well as the detection bias from physician based assessments in some trials as previously discussed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Oesophagitis</HEADING>
<P>The best documented toxicity is radiation oesophagitis, especially in the MRC trials (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK> where the patient diary cards clearly record the time course and intensity of dysphagia. <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> reported earlier dysphagia with the two shorter treatment regimens.</P>
<P>In those reporting oesophagitis numerically, between 0% and 56% of patients experienced grade 3-4 toxicity with a non-significant increase in the higher fractionated regimes <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. There is no clear relationship between number of fractions and incidence of oesophagitis. There was great heterogeneity in this data (I<SUP>2</SUP>=72%) and so we do not feel it appropriate to present a summary statistic. The absence of grading of toxicity in some papers and the difference in data collection, in particular physician assessment of symptoms rather than patient reported outcomes, means that no clear conclusion can be reached.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Radiation myelopathy</HEADING>
<P>Radiation myelopathy was suspected (although not confirmed at autopsy) in one patient in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK> and confirmed in one patient in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>, both of whom received 17Gy/ 2 fractions. In <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>, three patients - one receiving 17Gy/ 2 fractions and two 39 Gy/ 13 fractions - had clinical evidence of radiation myelopathy. In none of these trials was spinal shielding added or specific guidance given on the use of wedged fields to compensate for changes in antero-posterior diameter of the chest, but clinicians had the option of giving 36 Gy/ 12 fractions rather than 39 Gy/ 13 fractions in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>. One patient in <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> in the 50Gy/25F arm developed radiation myelopathy, but it is not stated whether this was a clinical or autopsy diagnosis. None of the other trials reported any cases of radiation myelopathy.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>) the spinal cord was shielded at tolerance doses. Simpson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>) limited the spinal cord dose to 25 Gy in the split course regimen and adjusted the field arrangement in the conventionally fractionated regimen, as did Nestle et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK>), to ensure the dose to the spinal cord did not exceed their tolerance limits. While this is necessary, it does introduce a degree of uncertainty to the dosimetry and in some cases may shield tumour itself.</P>
<P>No statistically significant difference in radiation myelopathy can be seen when comparing lower or higher fraction regimens but with an incidence between 0% and 1.61% any effect is likely to be small. The meta-analysis of incidence of radiation myelopathy was RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.37 to 4.51; moderate quality of evidence) <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.

Where pneumonitis was reported rates varied between 1.6% and 6%. No statistical difference was seen in the incidence of pneumonitis between lower and higher fraction regimens although mean incidence was lower in more fractionated regimens.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Survival</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported survival as an important endpoint and the data are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.. The worst survival (median 3.6 months) is seen in the only study that specifically excluded better PS patients (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK>). The 3 studies that specifically recruited patients with better PS (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>) had better survival (median 6.2 - 9 months). This is in keeping with the well known prognostic significance of PS.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>) showed a significant survival benefit for those patients treated with the higher dose regimen. In <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK> the improvement was modest with a two month increase in median survival (9 months vs 7 months), and 5% and 3% increases in the 1- and 2-year survival respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK> reported a statistically significant survival benefit at two years (18% vs 6%) for the 50 Gy/25 fraction regimen compared to 40Gy/10 fraction split course regimen. This must be interpreted with caution for a number of reasons; The entry criteria were different in that asymptomatic patients were included, and the numbers of patients in each arm of the study (79 and 81) are small. In addition, the confidence limits of 1-year and 2-year survival figures were not reported. The patients were relatively young compared to those in other studies and were of generally good PS . The difference in BED25 was quite small (8 Gy) and so it is surprising that a significant difference in survival was found. However the difference may reflect the fact that the less effective 40Gy/10F regimen was a 'split' course with a 4 week gap in the middle. Prolonged, interrupted and split course treatments have been shown to be less effective than equivalent continuous treatments in non-small cell lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Ching--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ching 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koukourakis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koukourakis 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> reported a significant improvement in 1-year survival with 30Gy/10F compared to16Gy/2F (19.6% vs 10.9%). On subgroup analysis, this was only significant in patients with PS 0-1, not in PS 2-4. Interestingly, all the PS 0-1 patients in this trial had stage 4 disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> reported a significant improvement in median survival with 20Gy/5F compared to 10Gy/1F (6 months vs 4.2 months). On post hoc subgroup analysis, the improvement only persisted for patients who were PS 0-1 and had localised disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK> reported a significant improvement in median survival with 16Gy/2F compared to 20Gy/5F (8 months vs 5.3 months). This result must be interpreted with caution, as only 100 patients were randomised, and the study was closed early due to poor accrual resulting in an imbalance in the number of patients in each arm. In addition, the BED25 is higher in the 20Gy/5F regimen, making a true survival difference very unlikely.</P>
<P>It was not possible to get enough data for time-to-event analysis from the original authors. Given the long time-scale since the studies were conducted, many no longer had the raw data available.</P>
<P>The results of the meta-analyses of 1 year survival are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK> using both fixed and random effects models. These show that overall there was a moderate degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 23%) and that any advantage favoured the more fractionated regimens.</P>
<P>The result of the meta-analysis of 1 year overall survival for patients of any performance status, with the random effects model, was RR= 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-1.00. With the fixed effects model, the meta-analysis of 1 year overall survival showed a difference in favour of more fractionated regimens (RR= 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99; moderate quality of evidence) just reaching statistical significance.</P>
<P>For the poorer performance patients the results are quite clear and show that there is no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0 using both methods) and that there appears to be no survival advantage from using more fractionated regimens. The meta-analysis of 1 year survival for patients with poor performance status (WHO performance status 2-4) was RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.91to 1.02; fixed effects; moderate quality of evidence).<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>
</P>
<P>However for better performance patients there is greater heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 52%) and as a result we did not feel that it was appropriate to present a summary statistic. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-01-02 10:00:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the third update of this review and no new RCTs have been identified. At least two authors reviewed the literature searches each time and extracted the data from the included papers independently. The one non-English paper (Reinfuss 1999) was not translated but the relevant data was extracted by two authors. One new trial <LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2012</LINK> has been identified as an abstract but the detailed results were not available even after attempting to contact the author. As there have been no other new RCTs identified from the repeated searches or referred to in any other review over the past eight years it seems unlikely that new RCTs missed by this update have been published. There remains a possibility that other RCTs were carried out before 2000 but not published, and so there is a small risk of publication bias. Overall we believe that the risk of bias from the conduct of this review is low.</P>
<P>The objectives were to evaluate which are the most effective and least toxic regimens of palliative RT to improve thoracic symptoms. Three studies reported better palliation from higher dose more fractionated regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK> both used physician-assessed scores, which may not be as accurate as patient self-assessment and are subject to bias. In addition, the method of defining response in <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK> was imprecise, and patient numbers in <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK> were small. <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> did show better symptom palliation at 1 month with the higher dose regimen and it is the only one of the three trials that collected outcome data using validated tools. It would have been interesting to know if the palliative benefit in <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> was only seen in PS 0-1 patients, but these data were not presented. <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> reported the duration of palliative effect was significantly longer with the higher dose regimen, but there were a higher proportion of PS 3 patients in the lower dose arm (34% vs 22%). It is possible that those patients with a poor PS have more thoracic and systemic symptoms, and therefore derived less durable palliative effect from RT, irrespective of dose. In addition, less than 40% of patients randomised were alive and assessable at 22 weeks when the difference between the regimens became statistically significant. There is good evidence that regimens with higher doses (or higher biological effective doses) give more toxicity, especially radiation oesophagitis. Overall, It would seem therefore that for most patients short hypofractionated regimens such as 10Gy/1F or 17Gy/2F are probably as effective at providing palliation as more protracted schedules, and have the advantage of fewer patient visits to hospital and reduced workload for RT departments.</P>
<P>Several non-randomised studies have reported the use of hypofractionated regimens with 10Gy/ 1 fraction (<LINK REF="STD-Scolaro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Scolaro 1995</LINK>), 16Gy/2F(<LINK REF="STD-Lupattelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lupattelli 2000</LINK>), 17Gy/2F (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vyas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vyas 1998</LINK>) and 24Gy/3F (<LINK REF="STD-Slotman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Slotman 1993</LINK>). They give supporting evidence of the effectiveness and the patterns of toxicity of these regimens.</P>
<P>Toxicities not identified in the randomised trials but subsequently described (<LINK REF="REF-Devereux-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereux 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lupattelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lupattelli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Old-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Old 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scolaro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Scolaro 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vyas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vyas 1998</LINK>) include nausea, episodes of acute chest pain, or fever and rigors during the first 24 to 48 hours after treatment, experienced by up to 50% of patients receiving large fraction RT to the chest. These are transient, rarely severe and usually managed by appropriate medication and warning the patients. Hatton et al (<LINK REF="REF-Hatton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatton 1997</LINK>) documented changes in peak expiratory flow rate immediately after RT to the chest. This study included patients receiving fractions of 10 Gy, 8.5 Gy and 3 Gy. The numbers were small and they could not identify an increased risk with large fractions, but suggested caution and the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe airway obstruction.</P>
<P>More serious is the incidence of spinal cord damage (radiation myelitis) following the use of 17Gy/2Fand 39Gy/13F reported in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>. Cases of probable radiation myelopathy following 17Gy/ 2 fractions to the chest have also been reported by Dardoufas et al (<LINK REF="REF-Dardoufas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dardoufas 1995</LINK>), Stevens et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>) and Vyas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Vyas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vyas 1998</LINK>). A case was also reported in <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> using 50Gy/25F. The data on myelopathy from the MRC studies was reviewed by Macbeth et al (<LINK REF="REF-Macbeth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macbeth 1996</LINK>) and the annual risks, with associated 95% confidence intervals, were presented. This suggested that the distribution of radiation myelopathy between regimens could have been random, but supported the conclusion of Schultheiss et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schultheiss-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultheiss 1992</LINK>) that the alpha/beta ratio for spinal cord should be about 2. If an alpha/beta ratio of 1.7 is taken for spinal cord as proposed by Singer et al (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>), 17Gy/2F, 39 Gy/13F, and 50Gy/25F all give biological equivalent doses (BED1.7) of greater than 100Gy (see table 01). No regimen with a BED1.7 of less than 100 Gy has been reported as causing myelopathy. It should be recognised that above such level the risk of myelopathy increases and measures such as spinal cord shielding or oblique fields shielding should be introduced. The minimum time between treatment and the development of myelopathy in the cases reported was 6 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>, which is much earlier than in other trials (earliest onset 8 months). However, it was not stated if the diagnosis was confirmed on autopsy. Definite conclusions about the risk of myelitis are difficult to make as some of the evidence cited above is from case reports and observational studies with a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>QOL was assessed using validated tools in only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erridge-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erridge 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>). There were no consistent findings between the trials, and it is not possible to comment on whether QOL is better with a particular RT regimen.</P>
<P>In conclusion, patients with NSCLC and thoracic symptoms needing palliation can be treated safely and effectively with 1 or 2-fraction RT regimens. If 17Gy/2F is used, measures should be taken to reduce the dose to the spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-Macbeth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macbeth 1996</LINK>). It may be more practical to reduce the dose to 16Gy/2F (BED1.7 = 91), which in a non-randomised series of 91 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lupattelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lupattelli 2000</LINK>) was shown to be effective, with no cases of myelopathy.</P>
<P>The second objective was to evaluate whether higher dose regimens are associated with increased survival. There is strong evidence for a modest increase in survival from one large high-quality randomised controlled trial (5% at 1 year and 3% at 2 years) in patients with localised disease and better PS given higher dose RT.(<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>). Three other trials have also reported a survival advantage with higher dose regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK> a large difference in survival was reported in a group of patients who seemed to have better PS. However the difference may reflect the fact that the less effective 40Gy/10F regimen was a 'split' course with a 4 week gap in the middle. Prolonged, interrupted and split course treatments have been shown to be less effective than equivalent continuous treatments in non-small cell lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Ching--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ching 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koukourakis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koukourakis 1996</LINK>) and other carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1992</LINK>), presumably because of accelerated tumour regrowth. The <LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> trial supports the results from <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; Post hoc subgroup analysis showed the improvement in survival seen with the higher dose regimen only persisted for patients who were PS 0-1 and had localised disease. The <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> trial also showed that the survival advantage seen with the higher dose regimen only applied to good PS patients. Interestingly however, all the good PS patients in this trial had metastatic disease. <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> is the only published RCT showing a survival advantage with higher RT doses in patients with metastatic disease, and therefore this result should be interpreted with caution. If the result were true, a possible explanation might be higher thoracic RT doses in patients with minimal metastatic spread improves local control and reduces the risk of death from local disease. With only 107 PS 0-1patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> trial, it seems unlikely a significant difference would be detected, particularly in view of the modest benefits seen in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>, a much bigger trial which only included good PS patients with no evidence of metastatic spread. In summary therefore, we have found no strong evidence for an improvement in survival for better PS patients from the use of more fractionated regimens.</P>
<P>None of the other studies demonstrated a significant difference in survival, although most were too small to reliably demonstrate changes in survival that might be clinically significant.</P>
<P>Due to the apparent heterogeneity of the studies in the regimens used and patients included, a formal meta-analysis was not attempted in the original review. To answer the question of whether particular sub-groups derived a survival benefit from differing RT schedules a subgroup analysis by performance status was attempted in this update. The studies not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK>) were all older studies and data were no longer available. It is noted that these studies were all assessed as having a higher risk of bias <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The results of our current meta-analysis need to be treated with caution as data were only available for 56% of patients. The findings also require further explanation taking into account the potential sources of heterogeneity. One obvious source of heterogeneity is the choice of regimens used in the trials. The trials compare quite varied regimens and also present differences in the biologically effective dose (BED10) between the regimens being compared. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Nestle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nestle 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK> are the two trials with more extreme dose ranges (34Gy and 1Gy, respectively) but neither of these trials (Nestle: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70-1.67; Senkus-Konefka; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.98-1.52) nor any of the others show an obvious correlation between the BED difference and the effect of more fractionated regimens. We therefore only carried out a meta-analysis using a random effects model. This obvious clinical heterogeneity of the trials is reflected in the fact that the meta-analysis of the PS 0-1 subgroup shows a moderate to high degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 52%) and the overall meta-analysis of all trials has moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 23%).</P>
<P>Secondly it is important to consider the findings of the Risk of Bias assessment <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> especially in relation to the findings on 1 year survival. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis of PS 0-1 patients have some uncertainties, the exceptions being MRC 1991 and 1996 and Sundstrom. In these low risk of bias trials, the two fractionation regimens obtain similar survival results both for the PS 0-1 and PS 2-4 patients . The two trials with significant results in favour of the more fractionated regimens have uncertainties that might lead to selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>). Additionally, while 1 year survival for the PS 0-1 patients is generally in the range of 25 to 40%, there are three trials that show unusually low survival. These trials are Bezjak with 14.3% in the less fractionated arm (10Gy/1F), <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK> with 11.4% in the more fractionated arm (20Gy/5F) and, most strikingly, <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK> with 9.4% in the less fractionated arm (16Gy/2F ) - worse outcomes than for the poorer PS patients treated with that regimen (13.5%). All these studies have uncertainties that might lead to selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bezjak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bezjak 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2005</LINK>) or reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall then, the meta-analyses do not indicate that there is any significant survival advantage in giving patients, more fractionated regimens with higher biological doses. Although the point estimates all favour the more fractionated regimens, the results are not statistically significant for the whole group using a random effects model analysis. There is therefore no strong evidence for the use of these regimens, even in good PS patients. However even taking a very optimistic view of the effectiveness of more fractionated regimens, using the risk ratio point estimate of 0.89 (from the largest RCTin this group, MRC 1996) and assuming a 35% 1-year survival rate in the lower dose arm for PS0-1 patients, then the probability of survival might only increase to 39% (NNT 50).</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were published between 1985 and to 2006, many of them predating the use of CT imaging for staging and RT planning. There have also been significant technical advances in RT delivery since 2006. So would trials investigating this question using current technology give a different result? As these were all randomised trials with similar RT techniques used in both arms and all that differed was the dose/ fractionation regimen, it seems unlikely. It is of course probable that better staging and patient selection and the more consistent use of chemotherapy would result in better overall survival and that radiation toxicity might be less than in the past but the effect of RT dose/ fractionation regimens on palliation and survival might well not be different.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-31 09:59:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with inoperable lung cancer that is too large for radical RT have a poor prognosis and the therapeutic options are limited. Controlling their symptoms and maintaining their quality of life should therefore be the main aim of treatment. This review has shown that palliative RT to the chest appears to be effective in controlling troublesome symptoms from intrathoracic tumour. There was a consistent finding in all the studies that symptoms improved to some extent and for some time after RT. It is conceivable, but improbable, that this is a large and reproducible placebo effect.But there was no consistent evidence to support the view that that longer, more fractionated regimens were associated with better or more durable palliation.</P>
<P>Patients with NSCLC and thoracic symptoms needing palliation can be treated safely and effectively with 1 or 2-fraction RT regimens. If 17Gy/2F is used, measures should be taken to reduce the dose to the spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-Macbeth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macbeth 1996</LINK>). It may be more practical to reduce the dose to 16Gy/2F (BED1.7 = 91), which in a non-randomised series of 91 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lupattelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lupattelli 2000</LINK>) was shown to be effective, with no cases of myelopathy.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses do not indicate that there is significant survival advantage in giving patients, more fractionated regimens with higher biological doses. Even if one assumes a 35% 1-year survival rate in the lower dose arm for PS0-1 patients, then the most optimistic analysis would suggest a more fractionated regimen might only increase that to 39%.</P>
<P>Higher dose palliative RT is clearly associated with more visits to hospital and more toxicity, and so the balance of benefit and risk needs to be carefully assessed and discussed openly with each patient.</P>
<P>The main findings are summarised in a summary of findings table. <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-23 10:50:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main purpose of this review was to assess the effect of palliative radiotherapy regimens on thoracic symptoms from NSCLC. All of the papers reported the effect on thoracic symptoms although the method of assessing these varied between the papers. This ranged between a physician's assessment of symptoms at fixed time points to daily diary cards completed by the patients themselves. Whatever the method of assessment, all radiotherapy regimens were reported as being associated with improvement in thoracic symptoms but no one radiotherapy schedule can be selected as offering the best palliation either in terms of size of effect or duration of effect. </P>
<P>Only 3 studies used validated QOL scores. In these studies, most domains measured did not show any significant difference between the two treatment arms. Where differences were seen, they tended to be short-lived and not apparent at the next assessment point.</P>
<P>Both short and long term toxicities were reported in all the papers although the methods of assessment and reporting varied greatly between papers. No significant difference has been demonstrated between various regimens although the timing of onset of acute toxicities did vary according to fraction size in one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK>). Radiation myelitis was rare but care should be taken with spinal cord doses and spinal cord shielding should be considered for higher BED regimens e.g. 17Gy/2#, 39Gy/13#.</P>
<P>The effect of radiotherapy on radiological response is less well documented with fewer studies reporting this outcome and many studies only assessing radiological response with CXR rather than CT. No conclusions can be drawn on which RT schedule has the biggest effect on radiological response.</P>
<P>The known effect of performance status on overall survival was shown with studies recruiting only poor PS patients having the lowest median survival and those recruiting only good PS patients having the highest survival. When stratified for performance status, RT regimens with more fractions did not show any statistical difference in 1 year survival compared with regimens with fewer fractions.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis by stage was not attempted as many of the original studies did not specify their staging methods and a large proportion of patients would have been treated without modern staging tools such as CT/PET.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-07 17:50:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen randomised trials are included in this review representing 3708 patients of which 3576 were evaluable and whose outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>A number of key limitations have been identified. The methods of symptom assessment and toxicity varied between studies in detail and quality (see Description of Studies, above). Only 3 studies used validated QOL scores leading to low quality of evidence when assessing acute toxicity. Reporting of radiation myelopathy was more consistent and here it was felt the quality of evidence was moderate.There was a wide range of radiotherapy regimens used making it difficult to perform comparisons and data stratified by performance status was only available for 56% of patients and so the conclusions drawn from the meta-analysis are only felt to represent moderate quality of evidence.</P>
<P>Assessment of stage and tumour response often did not use cross-sectional imaging leading to low quality of evidence when assessing radiological response.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-12-10 17:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is likely that most of the relevant trials have been included in this review as a systematic literature search was performed with broad search criteria as well as consultation with experts in lung radiotherapy. Where insufficient data was available in published reports, attempts were made to obtain unpublished data. <LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2012</LINK> which was only reported in abstract form and for which insufficient data were available has not been included.</P>
<P>It was not possible to obtain survival data stratified by performance status for all the subjects and only 56% of patients are represented in the meta-analysis of 1 year OS. Data on radiotherapy toxicity was also incomplete. All trials reported the effect of radiotherapy on major thoracic symptoms but the means of assessment was not standardised between the trials and so comparisons are difficult.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-30 12:19:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis in this paper is in contrast to the <LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2008</LINK> meta-analysis which showed a survival benefit for radiotherapy regimens with a higher calculated 'biological equivalent dose' (BED). However, this meta-analysis included treatment arms with roughly equivalent BED (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Senkus-Konefka 2005</LINK> whose two arms had calculated BED of 28Gy and 29.6Gy) and mis-allocated the treatment arms in <LINK REF="STD-Teo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Teo 1988</LINK> (43.7Gy allocated as "lower dose" arm, 42.8Gy allocated as "higher dose" arm). The <LINK REF="STD-Reinfuss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reinfuss 1999</LINK> paper is not included in the Fairchild paper although the two "immediate arms" would have met their inclusion criteria. It is not clear from the paper how the three-armed <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1985</LINK> patients were distributed. In the printed tables, the number of participants in each arm is stated as 136 although the maximum number of patients in any arm was 112. Similarly, the data for <LINK REF="STD-Sundstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sundstrom 2004</LINK> shows 146 patients in the lower BED arm and 130 patients in the higher BED arm, neither of which exactly matches any of the arms as reported in the paper.These errors and omissions may have led to unintended confounding factors and so resulted in an apparent significant difference in survival when such a difference does not exist. It should be noted that the hypothesis in the Fairchild paper differs to ours as they were looking for a difference in survival according to calculated BED while we were looking for a difference in survival according to total number of fractions prescribed.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Fairchild-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairchild 2008</LINK> meta-analysis took a different approach from ours in using the calculated BED to compare regimens. We chose a different approach by comparing the regimens on the basis of the number of fractions used in the regimens. We felt that this would be a more useful comparison with greater clinical relevance as the larger number of fractions involves not only more resource use but also more inconvenience for patients.</P>

<P>The majority of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and thoracic symptoms, especially those with poor PS should be treated with short courses of palliative RT (such as 10Gy/1F or 16-17Gy/2F). Care should be taken to avoid irradiating, or to reduce the dose to, the spinal cord if 17Gy/2F is used.</P>
<P>This review does not provide strong evidence to suggest that selected patients with good PS should be considered for treatment with more fractionated palliative regimens (such as 36Gy/12F). If it is felt acceptable to offer these regimens to patients, an informed discussion should make clear the very modest possible effect on survival balanced against the extra visits to hospital and the increased risk of toxicity (especially oesophagitis).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-23 11:03:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There needs to be more research into the acute toxicities of large fraction palliative RT for lung cancer and into ways of reducing them.</P>
<P>More research is needed into the role of radical compared to high dose palliative RT in good PS patients with bulky tumours and no obvious metastases. In particular there needs to be greater homogeneity of entry criteria and treatment regimens. In the future, however, large trials comparing different RT regimens may be difficult to establish due to the increasing use of systemic chemotherapy.It has not been within the scope of this review to consider chemotherapy and its increasing role in the palliation of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. But there clearly is a need for more research into the integration of chemotherapy with palliative RT.</P>
<P>Future research could also consider the use of radiosensitising agents to improve symptomatic responses and duration of response and the role of re-irradiation for symptom control after local relapse including the effectiveness of endobronchial brachytherapy.</P>
