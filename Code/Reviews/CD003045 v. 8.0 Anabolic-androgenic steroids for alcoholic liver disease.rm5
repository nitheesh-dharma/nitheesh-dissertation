<P>Alcohol causes a major part of the liver diseases in the Western World. Several trials have addressed the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease. This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, and histology of patients with alcoholic liver disease. Anabolic-androgenic steroid intervention is not associated with a significant increase in non-serious adverse events, but with the seldom occurrence of serious adverse events. Accordingly, there is no evidence supporting the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease, but further randomised clinical trials may be needed to settle the question.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alcohol is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the Western World. Randomised clinical trials have examined the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids for patients with alcoholic liver disease based on the results of randomised clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, The<I> Cochrane Controlled Trials Register</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE, LILACS,</I> and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> until June 2006. Electronic searches were combined with full text searches. Manufacturers and researchers in the field were also contacted. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials studying patients with alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and/or alcoholic cirrhosis were included. Interventions encompassed anabolic-androgenic steroids at any dose or duration versus placebo or no intervention. The trials could be double blind, single blind, or unblinded. The trials could be unpublished or published, and no language limitations were applied.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Outcomes are assessed at maximal follow-up. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method. The statistical package RevMan Analyses was used. The methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was assessed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Combining the results of five randomised clinical trials randomising 499 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis demonstrated no significant effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality (relative risk (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.29), liver-related mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.15), complications of liver disease (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.10), and liver histology. Anabolic-androgenic steroids did not significantly affect a number of other outcome measures, including sexual function and liver biochemistry. Anabolic-androgenic steroids were not associated with a significantly increased risk of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.59) or with serious adverse events (RR 4.54, 95% CI 0.57 to 36.30). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant beneficial effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on any clinically important outcomes (mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, and histology) of patients with alcoholic liver disease.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-23 12:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Alcohol is one of the most common causes of liver diseases in the Western World. Alcoholic liver disease has also become an important cause of liver injury in a number of low-income countries as economics improve and both cultural and religious indictments against drinking are decreasing. In many countries the incidence of alcoholic liver disease is increasing at a time when the incidence of other liver disorders remains steady or is falling (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alcohol is a major hepatotoxin (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). Alcohol leads to fatty liver (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1968</LINK>), alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Purhoit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purhoit 2006</LINK>), and alcoholic cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). Data from long-term studies in which patients with alcoholic fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis were followed for up to 13 years demonstrate that alcoholic hepatitis is a predictor of later development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_rensen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sørensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marbet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marbet 1987</LINK>). Acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, may increase transcription of collagen I. Alcohol induced necrosis and inflammation may trigger the scarring and the development of fibrosis and later on the development of cirrhosis.</P>
<P>About 70% of patients with clinical alcoholic hepatitis also have alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 1984a</LINK>). Survival is adversely affected by continued alcohol abuse. Five-years survival in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who stop drinking is 50% to 75%. Five-years survival in patients continuing to drink rarely exceed 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1968</LINK>). The progression of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in alcoholics is enhanced by the presence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus markers (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Purhoit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purhoit 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Men with alcoholic cirrhosis have symptoms such as testicular atrophy, azoospermia, reduced body hair, reduced beard growth, reduced prostatic size as well as gynaecomastia, arterial spiders, female escutcheon, female body habitus, and sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Steenbergen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Steenbergen 1993</LINK>). These findings all suggest that there is an endocrine imbalance of sexual hormones. In accordance, plasma concentrations of non-protein bound testosterone and non-sex hormone binding globulin bound testosterone - the biologically active fractions - are generally low or decreased in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>) and levels of oestrogens are often increased (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few studies have addressed sex hormone disturbances in women with chronic alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1993</LINK>). In female alcoholics ethanol consumption increases the frequency of menstrual disturbances, abortions, and earlier occurrence of menopause. In postmenopausal women with alcoholic liver disease, the main disturbances of sex hormone metabolism consist of elevated oestrone and non-sex hormone binding globulin concentrations, while serum concentrations of steroid sulphates and 5-alfa-dihydrotestosterone are reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A questionnaire survey among European hospital-based specialists in gastroenterology/hepatology demonstrated that 5% to 43% of the specialists, depending on the region, considered using anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1993</LINK>). Several controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies have been undertaken in order to estimate the beneficial and harmful effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>). The studies have yielded varying results and the power of the controlled studies has been low. Moreover, previous meta-analyses on the topic have reached conflicting results due to the accumulation of more trial results and differences regarding inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Review represents an update of our previous Cochrane systematic review on the topic (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2003</LINK>), see other published versions of this review.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included only randomised clinical trials. The trials should have used a proper method of randomisation, ie, central randomisation; serially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contains elements convincing of adequate allocation concealment. Trials with quasi-randomisation were excluded. Randomised clinical trials could be double blind, single blind, or unblinded. The randomised clinical trials could be unpublished or published as an article, an abstract, or a letter. No language limitations were applied.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with alcoholic liver disease according to the diagnostic work-up used in the individual randomised clinical trial were included. The analyses examined the efficacy of anabolic-androgenic steroids in the different subgroups of patients with alcoholic liver disease (fatty liver; alcoholic hepatitis; alcoholic fibrosis; alcoholic cirrhosis) as well as combined.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Peroral or parenteral administration of anabolic-androgenic steroids at any dose versus placebo or no intervention. Additional interventions were allowed as long as both intervention groups in the individual trial received the additional intervention(s) equally.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>All outcomes were assessed at maximal follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>(1) Number of patients dying (total and liver-related death).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>(2) Development of clinical symptoms and complications (ie, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-renal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma).<BR/>(3) Liver function.<BR/>(4) Liver biopsy findings.<BR/>(5) Liver biochemistry.<BR/>(6) Alcohol consumption during follow-up.<BR/>(7) Adverse events. Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that did not have a causal relationship with the treatment, but did result in a dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Severe adverse events were defined according to the ICH guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) as any event that would increase mortality; were life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalisation; resulted in a persistent or significant disability; or any important medical event, which may have jeopardised the patient or required intervention to prevent it.</P>
<P>In addition, any data on quality of life and health economics (eg, length of hospitalisation) were compared.</P>

<P>Further trials were sought by reading the reference lists of the identified studies and through full text searches.</P>
<P>No restrictions of year of publication, language, or publication status were applied.</P>
<P>The principal authors of the identified randomised clinical trials were approached and inquired about additional trials they might know of. Pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of anabolic-androgenic steroids were contacted in order to obtain additional publications on randomised clinical trials and unpublished randomised clinical trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 12:08:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The meta-analysis was updated following the recommendations given by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Trial selection and data extraction</B>
<BR/>The authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review according to the prespecified selection criteria. A third opinion plus discussion resolved disagreements. We wrote to the authors of trials when data were missing in the report.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Patient characteristics, diagnosis, and treatments</B>
<BR/>The following items were recorded from the individual randomised clinical trials: mean (or median) age, sex ratio, alcohol consumption, form of liver disease,<B> </B>duration and severity of liver disease at entry, a concomitant cause of liver disease, dose<B> </B>of anabolic-androgenic steroids intervention,<B> </B>type<B> </B>of<B> </B>intervention in the control group and any additional intervention. The diagnostic work-up before entry was registered. Hepatitis markers were evaluated and type of alcoholic liver disease included in the randomised clinical trial. Development of clinical symptoms and complications, liver function, liver biochemistry, liver biopsy findings, alcohol consumption, quality of life, health economics (ie, length of hospital stay, cost of medication, and cost of additional follow-up weighted against any gains in health), and adverse events during follow-up were registered.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection and data-extraction bias</B>
<BR/>All randomised clinical trials considered for inclusion were analysed by the contributors, who conferred about any disagreements.</P>
<P>All randomised clinical trials had the pertinent data extracted by the contributors. All identified trials were listed and trials excluded from the meta-analysis of the review were identified with the reason for exclusion.</P>
<P>Data on the number of patients with each outcome event, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance of follow-up, were sought to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the above data were not available in the trial reports, further information was sought by correspondence with the principal investigator.</P>
<P>
<B>Bias Risk</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials and hence bias risk were assessed using components of methodological quality (generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</I>
</B>The procedure used to create a random sequence ensuring that each participant has a known, unpredictable, and usually equal chance of being assigned to intervention groups. The allocation sequence generation was classified as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Adequate</B>, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice may also be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Unclear</B>, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Inadequate</B>, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. Such studies are known as quasi-randomised studies and were excluded from the review due to the risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>The procedure used to conceal the allocation sequence from the investigators who assign participants to the intervention groups. The allocation concealment was classified as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Adequate</B>, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes. Envelopes should be serially numbered, sealed, and opaque. However, this information is rarely provided, indicating an increased risk of bias. In that case, sealed envelopes may constitute an intermediate category between adequate and unclear.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Unclear</B>, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Inadequate</B>, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised. Such studies were excluded due to their risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Blinding </I>
</B>
<BR/>Blinding was classified as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Adequate</B>, if the trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding involved identical placebo and active drugs (smell, taste and shape).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Unclear</B>, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Inadequate</B>, not performed, if the trial was not double blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Follow-up</I>
</B>
<BR/>The reported follow-up was classified as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Adequate</B>, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Unclear</B>, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Inadequate</B>, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, we had registered whether the randomised clinical trial had reported the use of intention-to-treat analysis or not (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method including all randomised patients. Patients without the outcome variable were considered failures (worst-case scenario analysis).</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighed mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) both with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We performed all analyses on mortality according to the intention-to-treat method, ie, including all randomised patients. We used the statistical package RevMan Analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. We examined intervention effects by using both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Demets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demets 1987</LINK>) with the significance level set at P &lt; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, we presented only the results of the fixed-effect model analysis. In case of discrepancies of the two models we reported the results of both models.</P>
<P>Potential causes for heterogeneity were explored by performing subgroup analyses. The review performed subgroup analyses with regard to the stage of alcoholic liver disease, methodological quality of included randomised clinical trials (analysing separately randomised clinical trials with adequate quality components and inadequate quality components (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>), and way of administration of anabolic-androgenic steroids as well as preparation, dose, and duration of anabolic-androgenic steroids treatment.</P>
<P>Due to the risk of chance, statistical findings among the secondary outcome measures were interpreted conservatively.</P>
<P>We planned to examine potential publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>) and other sources of bias using the funnel plot method (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), but due to the few trials identified we did not explore it.<BR/>

<I>Included studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>In 14 included publications, four randomised clinical trials were described in full paper articles (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>) and one randomised clinical trial in an abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>The individual randomised clinical trials are described in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>The five trials reported random allocation of 499 patients with alcoholic liver disease (n = 499) to anabolic-androgenic steroids. All the randomised clinical trials compared anabolic-androgenic steroids versus placebo except the Bonkovsky trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>), which compared anabolic-androgenic steroids versus no intervention.</P>
<P>The entry criteria in the randomised clinical trials varied, but the inclusion criteria were generally of good quality making it highly likely that all patients did in fact have alcoholic liver disease. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis were included in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>). Mendenhall et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK>) did not give the proportion of patients also having cirrhosis. However, in the two other trials the proportion of patients with cirrhosis was 71.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK>) and 54.0% (<LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were included in two randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>). Fenster et al (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK>) did not report the proportion of patients also having alcoholic hepatitis. In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>) the proportion of patients also having histological alcoholic hepatitis was 51.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 447 (89.6%) patients were males (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>), while 20 (2.0%) patients were females (<LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>). The exact figure of males and females is not given for 32 (6.4%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK>). However, the sex ratio was quite balanced between the two groups of this trial.</P>
<P>The experimental treatment consisted of oxandrolone 80 mg per day orally in three randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>), micronized-free testosterone 600 mg day (200 mg three times per day) orally in one randomised clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>), and 100 mg of testosterone propionate or methenolone enanthate every other day intramuscularly in the <LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>The duration of the treatment varied from 21 days in <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bonkovsky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonkovsky 1991</LINK>, over one month in <LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1984b</LINK> to 36 months in <LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>.</P>

<I>Excluded studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>A total of 22 studies, described in 30 publications, were excluded mainly because they were observational studies or case series. The reasons for exclusion are listed in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Two of these described randomised clinical trials including patients with mixed aetiologies (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puliyel-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Puliyel 1977</LINK>). All patients had liver cirrhosis in the Wells trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1960</LINK>), but the aetiology of the cirrhosis was not given. Only 18/53 patients had a history of alcoholism. All patients had also liver cirrhosis in the Puliyel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Puliyel-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Puliyel 1977</LINK>), but there were no data on aetiology. These two randomised clinical trials are excluded, due to the fact that only a small proportion of included patients were considered to have alcoholic liver disease.<BR/>
<BR/>We also excluded the <LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1993a</LINK> trial because it examined the combination of two interventions (oxandrolone plus nutritional support) versus placebo. However, we have included this trial in a sensitivity analysis in order to examine the robustness of our findings.</P>

<P>
<B>Mortality</B>
<BR/>Combining the results of the five randomised clinical trials demonstrated no significant effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality (RR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.29). In the anabolic-androgenic steroids group 87/275 (31.6%) patients died versus 73/224 (32.6%) patients in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>A worst-case scenario analysis (all patients who dropped-out or were withdrawn were considered dead) did not change the estimate of no significant effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis stratifying the trials according to the adequacy of the single methodologic quality components (generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up) did not demonstrate significant differences regarding the effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality between trials with and without adequate methodology (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). Comparing the estimate of anabolic-androgenic steroids intervention effect in adequately blinded trials (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.98) to that in unblinded trials (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.18) demonstrated no significant difference between the two estimates (z = -0.87 P = 0.38). Comparing trials with adequate methodology regarding all four components to trials with one or more inadequate components gave results similar to <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The RR of death of the trials with a follow-up duration within 21 days was 1.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 6.30), while the RR of the randomised clinical trials with a follow-up duration of at least six months was 1.01 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.29) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The RR of death of the trials evaluating oxandrolone was 0.78 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.13); the RR of the trial evaluating testosterone was 1.19 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.98); and the RR of the trial evaluating testosterone propionate or methenolone was 1.57 (95% CI 0.53 to 4.65) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>The RR of death of the randomised clinical trials including patients with alcoholic hepatitis was 0.89 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.18); the RR of the trials including patients with alcoholic cirrhosis was 1.25 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis adding the excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1993b</LINK>) treating patients with oxandrolone plus nutritional supplement versus placebo did not change this estimate significantly; RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.21) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>). In the treatment group 128/412 (31.1%) patients died versus 116/360 (32.2%) patients in the control group.</P>
<P>
<B>Liver-related mortality</B>
<BR/>No significant effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on liver-related mortality could be demonstrated (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.15). In the anabolic-androgenic steroids group 50/227 (22.0%) patients died versus 53/187 (28.3%) patients in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Liver-related complications</B>
<BR/>None of the trials considered variceal bleeding or hepato-renal syndrome as outcome measures.</P>
<P>Anabolic-androgenic steroids did not significantly affect the incidence of patients with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, pretibial edema, prostatic hypertrophia, sexual dysfunction, weight (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Anabolic-androgenic steroids reduced, however, significantly the prevalence of patients with gynaecomastia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.72, P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).<BR/>

<B>
<BR/>Liver haemodynamics and function</B>
<BR/>Only one randomised clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>) determined liver haemodynamics and liver function in 34 patients (22 in the anabolic-androgenic steroids group and 12 in the control group of the trial, which used skewed randomisation) after one year. No significant effect of testosterone could be found on portal pressure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>), indocyanine green clearance (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>), and galactose elimination capacity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Liver histology</B>
<BR/>There were no significant effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on either histological improvement of liver biopsy findings (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1966</LINK>) or histological changes in the liver (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>):</P>

<B>Sexual function</B>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK> trial evaluated sexual function in men with alcoholic cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988b</LINK>). At entry, 67% (95% confidence limits 61% to 74%) of 221 patients complained of sexual dysfunction (defined as problems with sexual desire, erection, or ejaculation). During follow-up (median 30 months (range 1 to 40 months) sexual dysfunction in the total patient group improved significantly (P &lt; 0.05) at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. However, there were no significant differences between the testosterone treated and the placebo treated patients regarding the proportion of patients with sexual dysfunction at any time during follow up (1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months). At 12 months follow-up the RR of sexual dysfunction was 1.11 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>).</P>

Anabolic-androgenic steroids had no significant effect on the occurrence of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.59). In the anabolic-androgenic steroids group 11/152 (7.2%) patients had non-serious adverse events versus 8/108 (7.4%) patients in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The adverse events observed in the anabolic-androgenic steroids group encompassed mild nausea (n = 4 patients), which was managed by giving oxandrolone with food; and diffuse complaints (n = 5 patients). The adverse events observed in the control group encompassed diffuse complaints (n = 6 patients).</P>
<P>Anabolic-androgenic steroids had no significant effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events, although there was a trend (RR 4.54; 95% CI 0.57 to 36.30). In the anabolic-androgenic steroids group 7/152 (4.6%) patients had serious adverse events versus 1/108 (0.9%) patient in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The adverse events observed in the anabolic-androgenic steroids group encompassed vascular thrombosis in the portal or hepatic veins (n = 3 patients), myocardial infarct (n = 1 patient), and polycythaemia (n = 3 patients). The adverse event observed in the control group encompassed polycythaemia (n = 1 patient) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<B>Quality of life and health economics</B>
<BR/>Only one trial measured quality of life employing crude measures, ie, numbers of days with normal activity and number of days in hospital within the last 100 days (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>At 12 months, the number of days with normal activity (ie, activity similar to premorbid activity) within the last 100 days was not significantly different between placebo and testosterone treatment: WMD 3.10 (95% CI -12.55 to 18.75) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anabolic-androgenic steroids did not significantly affect the number of days in hospital within the last 100 days at 12 months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>): WMD 0.50 (-2.27 to 3.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We could not demonstrate any significant effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, liver histology, and liver biochemistry when tested against placebo or no intervention in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis. We were unable to identify any randomised trials in patients with alcoholic steatosis.</P>
<P>Performing subgroup analysis considering methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials, contrasting high-quality trials versus low-quality trials did not reveal any significant influence of anabolic-androgenic steroids on the RR of mortality. This observation may not be in accordance with empirical studies suggesting significant overestimation of intervention effects in unblinded randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>), but is likely due to insufficient power. Subgroup analyses taking different treatments (oxandrolone, testosterone, methenolone), stage of liver disease (mainly alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis), or duration of follow-up into consideration showed no significant effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids versus control in any of the subgroups. </P>
<P>The lack of effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality was also observed taking into consideration the excluded trial evaluating oxandrolone plus nutritional support versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1993b</LINK>). We excluded this randomised clinical trial because it evaluated the combination of anabolic-androgenic steroids plus another intervention. On the other hand, nutrition has no verified effect on mortality of patients with alcoholic hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Cabr_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabré 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cabr_x00e9_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabré 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, the present results confirm our previous meta-analyses on anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>, see other published versions of this review).</P>
<P>Some trials have claimed that oxandrolone may provide beneficial effects in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In a six-month conditional analysis, removing patients that died within the first two months after randomisation, Mendenhall and associates (<LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 1984a</LINK>) observed a significant effect of oxandrolone on mortality in patients with moderate disease. Such analyses are difficult to interpret. First, by removing the patients who died early (within one or two months) you are not likely to have a randomised comparison any more. Secondly, this analysis was based on a subgroup analysis of patients. Mendenhall and associates (<LINK REF="STD-Mendenhall-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Mendenhall 1993b</LINK>) could not demonstrate any significant effect of oxandrolone plus nutritional support versus placebo. In a subgroup of patients with moderate malnutrition and adequate caloric intake, however, oxandrolone plus nutritional support reduced six-month mortality significantly. Subgroup analyses are often misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Assmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assmann 2000</LINK>). Because of such risks researchers need to be cautious about subgroup analyses and the interpretation of the results of the ones that they feel compelled to do.</P>
<P>Anabolic-androgenic steroids were without any significant effect on liver histology and liver haemodynamics. We were also unable to detect any significant influence of anabolic-androgenic steroids on liver-related mortality, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, pretibial oedema, and weight. Anabolic-androgenic steroids were also without significant effect on all other liver biochemical and liver function variables. However, anabolic-androgenic steroids significantly increased the b-haemoglobin concentration (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>). These observations may be real, but even then cannot establish any therapeutic indication for anabolic-androgenic steroids in alcoholic liver disease. </P>
<P>Aromatisable anabolic-androgenic steroids lead to a significant increase in plasma oestrogen concentrations. This increase is significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in controls (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>). Due to a higher increase in testosterone than in concentrations of oestrogens, the oestrogen/testosterone-ratio decreases during testosterone administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>). In accordance, a significant decrease was observed in the proportion of patients with gynaecomastia in the testosterone treated group (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>). This effect may not, however, establish an indication for using testosterone in these patients considering the risk of serious adverse events and the fact that symptomatic gynaecomastia may be treated with surgical ablation.</P>
<P>According to the observations of the CSL trial (<LINK REF="STD-CSL-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CSL 1986</LINK>), the testosterone-treated patients did not differ significantly from the placebo-treated patients regarding changes in sexual function (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988b</LINK>). On the positive side, a number of the male cirrhotic patients showed improvements of their sexual function irrespective of the treatment offered to the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anabolic-androgenic steroids were not associated with a significant increase in non-serious adverse events. There was a trend for the treated group to have more serious adverse events, but that did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.15). Three patients with portal or hepatic thrombosis, one with myocardial infarction, and three with polycythaemia constituted the serious adverse events reported in the anabolic-androgenic steroids group versus one with polycythaemia in the control group. We observed that testosterone increased b-haemoglobin. It has been claimed that oxandrolone increases clotting factors in cirrhotic patients with vitamin K resistant hypoprothrombinaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Tamburro-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Tamburro 1967</LINK>). It cannot be excluded that testosterone may increase the incidence of thrombosis, possibly via an increase in estrogens during anabolic-androgenic steroids administration (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988b</LINK>). Acute myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported as serious adverse events in several athletes using androgens (<LINK REF="REF-Ferenchick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferenchick 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Accordingly, we have been unable to identify any convincing evidence supporting anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease patients. However, this review does not preclude the possibility of a beneficial effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids in alcoholic liver disease; or in other form of liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Shahidi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahidi 2001</LINK>). Evidence about how much medical interventions work may change over time. Ioannidis and Lau (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>) recently applied 'recursive cumulative meta-analyses' of randomised clinical trials to evaluate the relative change in the pooled treatment effect over time for 60 medical interventions within pregnancy/perinatal medicine and cardiology. With 500 accumulated patients, the pooled relative risk may change by about 0.6 to 1.7 fold in the immediate future. When 2000 patients have been randomised, the pooled relative risk may change by 0.7 to 1.3 fold. </P>
<P>Meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials have been unable to demonstrate significant effects of colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2005a</LINK>), glucocorticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>), insulin/glucagon (<LINK REF="REF-Trinchet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinchet 1992</LINK>), milk thistle (<LINK REF="REF-Flora-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flora 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2005b</LINK>), propylthiouracil (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2005c</LINK>), parenteral amino acid supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Mezey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mezey 1991</LINK>), amlodipine (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1998</LINK>), and polyenylphosphatidylcholine (<LINK REF="REF-Lieber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieber 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieber 2003</LINK>) for alcoholic liver disease. At present, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (<LINK REF="REF-Mato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mato 1999</LINK>) and pentoxifylline (<LINK REF="REF-Akriviadis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akriviadis 2000</LINK>) may seem promising interventions for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mato 1999</LINK>), but more randomised clinical trials are needed before S-adenosyl-L-methionine can be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2006</LINK>) and this also applies to pentoxifylline, which has only been evaluated in one published randomised trial including patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Abstinence from ethanol remains the best intervention for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1994</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant beneficial effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, and liver histology of patients with alcoholic liver disease. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The absence of evidence for an effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on clinically relevant outcome variables, however, does not mean that there is evidence of lack of effect. If researchers wish to conduct new randomised clinical trials they ought to be large and closely monitored for the occurrence of adverse events. We recommend that investigators report their trials according to guidelines described in the <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-Statement" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT Statement</LINK> (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
