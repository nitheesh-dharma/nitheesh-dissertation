<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-13 04:54:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="korula  george">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>In women being treated with medicines to help eggs to grow (called ovulation induction), Cochrane authors wished to know whether adding medicines (called ovulation triggers) that help to release the egg (ovulation) would lead to more women having babies without causing harm compared with not giving them ovulation triggers. We found two randomised studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Medicines that are given orally (e.g. clomiphene citrate) or by injection (e.g. gonadotrophins) are used to help eggs to grow in women who are unable to have children because they are not able to produce eggs (anovulation). In these women, instead of waiting for the eggs to be released spontaneously, additional medicines (called ovulation triggers) are often used (e.g. human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)) to help release the eggs. They are thought to improve the chances of ovulation occurring. They also help to control when ovulation occurs. This helps in timing more accurately when sexual intercourse should take place, so that the woman's chances of becoming pregnant are better. These ovulation triggers are given when the sac in which the egg is developing (follicle) is thought to be fully developed, based on ultrasound scans. However, this method is not always accurate and may lead to the ovulation trigger being given before the egg has matured. If eggs that are not fully developed are released, the chances of a successful pregnancy could be reduced. Couples are expected to have sex 36 hours after the ovulation trigger is given, and the need to stick to this timing may increase psychological stress for the couple. Ovulation triggers also add to the cost of treatment and occasionally may cause serious adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The two studies included in this review randomly assigned 305 women being treated with clomiphene citrate to help eggs to develop to additionally receive a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. We found no trials comparing other ovulation triggers given with other medicines used for ovulation induction. The evidence is current to November 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Giving women on clomiphene citrate additional urinary hCG may not increase their chances of delivering live babies, ovulating or becoming pregnant. Multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and preterm deliveries were not more common with or without an ovulation trigger. No serious adverse events were reported in either study.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We cannot be certain whether ovulation triggers are better or worse than no ovulation triggers in women undergoing ovulation induction because not enough women were included in the two trials for definite results to be obtained. Larger trials in women undergoing ovulation induction that compare different ovulation triggers versus no additional treatment are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-13 04:48:16 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Anovulation is a common cause of infertility. Drugs used to treat anovulation include selective oestrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors and gonadotrophins. Ovulation triggers are used with these drugs, as a surrogate for the hormonal surge seen in spontaneous menstrual cycles, to control the timing of ovulation and the timing of sexual intercourse. Ovulation triggers given without reliable evidence of oocyte maturity could be inappropriately timed; they increase costs, and the need to time intercourse precisely after the ovulation trigger is given adds to psychological stress.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-13 04:50:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new trials were identified. This review includes two RCTs with low risk of bias that compared urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) versus no treatment in anovulatory women receiving clomiphene citrate. Urinary hCG did not result in an increase in live birth rate over no hCG (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.83; two trials, 305 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 16%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), but very serious imprecision around the effect estimate reduces our confidence in the apparent lack of effect of hCG as an ovulation trigger in clomiphene-induced cycles in anovulatory women.</P>
<P>Among this review's secondary outcomes, urinary hCG may not increase ovulation rate (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.77; two trials, 305 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 55%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89; two trials, 305 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 35%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or miscarriage rate in pregnant women (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.17 to 8.23; two trials, 54 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Multiple pregnancies and preterm deliveries were uncommon, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, adverse events and deaths were not reported as outcomes in either trial.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-13 05:24:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Anovulation (absence of ovulation) and oligo-ovulation (infrequent or irregular ovulation) are common causes of infertility and constitute about 21% of the fertility problems in women (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-13 05:21:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Disorders of ovulation have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into three groups (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2005a</LINK>). Group 1 disorders are due to hypothalamic-pituitary failure, Group 2 disorders are due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and Group 3 disorders are due to ovarian failure. Women in the WHO Group 2 usually present with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea. They are not oestrogen deficient, they respond with a withdrawal bleed to progesterone challenge and they have normal gonadotrophin and prolactin levels. These disorders are common and include the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).</P>
<P>Pharmaceutical agents are used to induce ovulation. Orally effective drugs include selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (like clomiphene citrate) and aromatase inhibitors. Gonadotrophins (injectables) generally are reserved for second-line therapy.</P>
<P>SERMs block oestrogen receptor sites in the hypothalamus and the pituitary, creating an impression of a low oestrogenic state. The higher centre of the brain responds with pulsatile release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and a consequent increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). This results in follicular growth and maturation (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2006</LINK>). Clomiphene citrate remains the most commonly and extensively used anti-oestrogen. Tamoxifen, another anti-oestrogen, is used relatively infrequently for this indication.</P>
<P>Aromatase inhibitors have been used to induce ovulation in WHO Group 2 ovulatory dysfunction. They act at the level of the ovary to prevent the conversion of androgens to oestrogen by suppressing the enzyme aromatase. This releases the higher centres from the negative feedback of oestrogen, resulting in increased FSH production with subsequent follicular growth and maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2006</LINK>). Increased androgen levels in the ovary are also believed to increase sensitivity to FSH (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1999</LINK>). Absence of oestrogen receptor blockade makes this an attractive alternative to anti-estrogens, especially when the latter fail to elicit a response. Letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane are the commonly available compounds. Reports of an increased incidence of congenital malformations such as cardiac and locomotor abnormalities with the use of letrozole led to restrictions on the use of aromatase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Biljan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biljan 2005</LINK>). These abnormalities were not validated in a subsequent study, in which a larger number of babies were born following the use of letrozole (<LINK REF="REF-Tulandi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tulandi 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gonadotrophins are indicated when oral preparations fail or are contraindicated because of side effects. These drugs stimulate follicular growth through direct action on the ovary (<LINK REF="REF-Macklon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklon 2004</LINK>). Gonadotrophin preparations are obtained from human menopausal urine or by recombinant technology. Depending on the purification process, urinary-derived gonadotrophins may be available as human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), purified FSH or highly purified FSH. The FSH content remains constant at 75 IU, and the LH content varies from 75 IU to 1 IU to 0.1 IU, respectively. In contrast, recombinant FSH (rFSH) contains 75 IU of FSH with no LH (<LINK REF="REF-Macklon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklon 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the aim of ovulation induction is mono-follicular development, caution needs to be exercised to prevent a hyperresponse. Development of several follicles, especially those seen in women with PCOS, can lead to multiple pregnancy and/or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is characterised by excessive ovarian response, leading to increased vascular permeability with resultant third space fluid accumulation (<LINK REF="REF-Barbieri-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbieri 2004</LINK>). Vaginal ultrasound is recommended to monitor follicular growth during ovulation induction, at least in the first treatment cycle, when oral agents are used, but it is considered mandatory when gonadotrophins are used (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-13 05:03:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>In a spontaneous menstrual cycle, the rising level of oestrogen produced from the developing follicle initiates an LH surge. This surge triggers the process of oocyte maturation and eventually results in its expulsion from the ovarian follicle. In anovulatory women, ovulation induction with SERMs, aromatase inhibitors or gonadotrophins initiates and sustains follicular development. Ovulation triggers are advocated as a surrogate for the endogenous LH surge to achieve better control of the timing of ovulation. In ovulation induction cycles monitored by ultrasound, ovulation triggers are administered once follicular size has reached 18 to 22 mm.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-13 05:22:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>In artificially induced and normal ovulation cycles, the precise timing of ovulation is unclear, and follicular size acts as a marker of oocyte development. Follicles that have reached a size of 18 mm on ultrasound are presumed to contain mature oocytes. Without ovulation triggers, follicular size is used to infer that ovulation is likely to occur, and intercourse is encouraged. Administration of an ovulation trigger permits better control over the timing of the LH surge and the reliability of occurrence of ovulation; it also provides the opportunity for better timing of intercourse or intrauterine insemination.</P>
<P>Urinary-derived human hCG is commonly used to trigger ovulation. Available alternative drugs include recombinant hCG (rhCG), recombinant LH (rLH) and a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. The hCG (urinary or recombinant) and the rLH act directly on the follicle, while GnRH agonists stimulate the release of endogenous LH from the pituitary (<LINK REF="REF-Macklon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklon 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-13 05:24:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Administration of an ovulation trigger depends entirely upon ultrasound measurement of follicular size and does not take into account the actual process of oocyte development. As follicular size is only an indirect marker of oocyte maturity, the ovulation trigger could be mis-timed, with the consequent LH surge resulting in the release of developmentally compromised oocytes. Premature administration may, therefore, affect oocyte quality, thereby negatively influencing the pregnancy rate. Rarely, luteinised unruptured follicles may also occur (<LINK REF="REF-Coetsier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coetsier 1996</LINK>). In addition to the fact that they are expensive, administration of ovulation triggers and timing of sexual intercourse to occur 36 hours later to maximise the chances of conception add to psychological stress for the couple. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (which can be fatal) is more common when hCG is used to induce ovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Delvigne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delvigne 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spontaneous ovulation is a natural process that perhaps allows better oocyte maturation and quality; this could result in a physiologically normal corpus luteum, a normal luteal phase and possibly better pregnancy rates. The practise of administering an ovulation trigger has not been rigorously tested, and questions remain regarding the efficacy of its use in comparison with spontaneous ovulation in women receiving ovulation induction agents for the treatment of anovulatory infertility.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>). In our previous search, we had identified two relevant trials evaluating urinary hCG versus no ovulation trigger in anovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate, but no conclusions could be drawn on the role of ovulation triggers because the data were inconclusive. In this updated review, we updated the search done in 2007 and incorporated advances in methods in accordance with the methodological requirements of Cochrane intervention reviews (<LINK REF="REF-MECIR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MECIR 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-George-2007" TYPE="STUDY">George 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK>) enrolled a total of 305 women (urinary hCG trigger group = 150; no trigger group = 155). In both trials, anovulatory women receiving treatment with clomiphene citrate were included. Anovulation was diagnosed on the basis of oligomenorrhoea, secondary amenorrhoea or serum progesterone assessed in the mid-luteal phase. In both trials, baseline demographic characteristics such as age, BMI, follicular size and number were similar between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>

<P>In both trials, anovulatory women treated with clomiphene citrate were randomly assigned to receive urinary hCG as an ovulatory trigger or to a no treatment arm; women assigned to the latter arm awaited a spontaneous LH surge.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK>, recruited women were randomly assigned before treatment, hence some women (n = 23) did not respond to treatment.

<P>We identified only two RCTs addressing the objectives of this review. These trials compared urinary hCG versus no ovulation trigger in anovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate.</P>
<P>Ovulation induction with or without urinary hCG as an ovulation trigger may be similar with regard to live birth rate, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate per clinical pregnancy, but we cannot be certain that ovulation triggers do not confer any advantage over no treatment because the combined sample size in the two trials was underpowered to rule out a clinically important benefit with urinary hCG (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Both trials were powered to detect only differences in ovulation rates, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK>) did not achieve the recruitment target. Preterm deliveries were uncommon, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, adverse events and deaths were not reported in either trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>We believe that our search was thorough, yet we did not identify any studies evaluating recombinant hCG, recombinant LH or GnRH agonists as ovulation triggers in anovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction using SERMs (clomiphene citrate/tamoxifen), aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane) or gonadotrophins (hMG, purified FSH, highly purified FSH or recombinant FSH). Our search revealed a plethora of trials comparing different ovulation triggers, but unfortunately, there is a paucity of trials evaluating each ovulation trigger versus no treatment or placebo.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>No evidence of a clinically beneficial effect of urinary hCG was seen compared with no ovulation trigger in women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene. This does not necessarily mean that urinary hCG has no beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Clinical pregnancy rates were higher in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK> (28%), which used 10,000 IU of urinary hCG, compared with <LINK REF="STD-George-2007" TYPE="STUDY">George 2007</LINK> (11%), which used a lower dose of urinary hCG (5000 IU). One could speculate that the higher dose in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK> would therefore be preferable. However, the no treatment arm in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK> revealed an equally high clinical pregnancy rate (33.33%), suggesting the need for more robust evidence before the optimal dose of urinary hCG can be determined. Although 5000 IU is considered the standard minimum dose, wide variability has been noted in the doses used, with little evidence to support any particular dose (<LINK REF="REF-Nargund-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nargund 2007</LINK>). Although not observed in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2006</LINK>, use of the higher dose could lead to development of OHSS in high-dose responders.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-01-13 07:21:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessments of overall quality of evidence were made using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach considers &#8216;quality&#8217; to be a judgement of the extent to which one can be confident that the estimates of effect are correct. 'Quality&#8217; is graded for each outcome on five domains. Evidence from randomised controlled studies is initially graded as high and is downgraded by one or two levels on each domain after full consideration of any limitations in the design of studies, the directness (or applicability) of evidence, the consistency and precision of results and the possibility of publication bias. This results in assessment of the quality of a body of evidence as<I> high, moderate, low </I>or<I> very low</I>. A GRADE quality level of <I>high </I>reflects confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect for an outcome. A judgement of <I>moderate </I>quality indicates that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but acknowledges the possibility that it is substantially different. <I>Low</I> or <I>very low</I> quality of evidence limits our confidence in the effect estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>These judgements for preselected patient-important outcomes for each comparison in this review are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The overall quality of evidence for all preselected outcomes was graded as <I>low </I>because of very serious imprecision, possibly due to inadequate sample size, that did not rule out the effects of random error.</P>

<P>This updated systematic review does not provide conclusive evidence to recommend or refute the use of urinary hCG, as an ovulation trigger, in anovulatory women treated with clomiphene citrate.</P>
<P>Limited data from this review provide no evidence to suggest that urinary hCG used as an ovulatory trigger in anovulatory women receiving clomiphene citrate improves the outcomes of live birth, ovulation, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and preterm delivery compared with not using an ovulatory trigger, but limited data from the two included trials do not provide conclusive evidence to refute its use.</P>
<P>The use of other ovulation triggers in anovulatory women treated with other ovulation-inducing agents has not been properly evaluated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-13 07:23:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The role of ovulation-inducing agents in anovulatory women is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2009</LINK>). Although various ovulation triggers are commonly used in clinical practice, evidence is insufficient to support this role.</P>
<P>Since the time of publication of the initial version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>), no trials on the need for ovulation triggers in anovulatory women undergoing treatment have been published. In spite of lack of evidence, the current focus appears to be on the comparison of different types of ovulation triggers through many published reports. The question "Is a trigger necessary or beneficial?" needs to be addressed first.</P>
<P>More trials that are adequately powered and that directly compare different ovulation triggers versus placebo/no treatment are required before recommendations can be made. A larger study is also needed to evaluate the efficacy of urinary hCG as an ovulation trigger in anovulatory women. Any future study evaluating the role of urinary hCG in anovulatory women treated with clomiphene citrate needs to take into account the following: The live birth rate with the use of clomiphene citrate has not been reported in randomised trials but is likely to be in the range of 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Homburg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homburg 2005</LINK>). To estimate a 5% difference in live birth rates with the use of urinary hCG, a sample size of 2800 women will be required. This would best be addressed in the form of a well-planned multi-centre study.<BR/>
