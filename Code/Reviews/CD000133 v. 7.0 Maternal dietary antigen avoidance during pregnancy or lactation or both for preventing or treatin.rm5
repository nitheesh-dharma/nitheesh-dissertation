<P>Evidence is inadequate to advise women to avoid specific foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding to protect their children from allergic diseases like eczema and asthma.</P>
<P>We included five trials, involving 952 participants. Trials of mothers' avoidance of milk, eggs, and other potentially 'antigenic' foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or both, provide inadequate evidence about whether such avoidance helps prevent atopic eczema or asthma in the child. Women who avoided eating these foods gained significantly less weight during pregnancy in the one trial reporting on this outcome, raising the possibility of adverse nutritional effects on the mother or fetus. Finally, one small trial reported an inconclusive response of breastfed infants with atopic eczema when their mothers avoided consumption of cow milk and egg.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-22 15:01:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The evidence from five trials, involving 952 participants, does not suggest a protective effect of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months of life. Data on allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or both, and urticaria are limited to a single trial each and are insufficient to draw meaningful inferences. Longer-term atopic outcomes have not been reported. The restricted diet during pregnancy was associated with a slightly but statistically significantly lower mean gestational weight gain, a non-significantly higher risk of preterm birth, and a non-significant reduction in mean birthweight.</P>
<P>The evidence from two trials, involving 523 participants, did not observe a significant protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance during lactation on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months or on positive skin-prick tests to cow milk, egg, or peanut antigen at one, two, or seven years.</P>
<P>One crossover trial involving 17 lactating mothers of infants with established atopic eczema found that maternal dietary antigen avoidance was associated with a non-significant reduction in eczema severity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-19 15:19:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce substantially her child's risk of atopic diseases, and such a diet may adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition, or both. Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during lactation may reduce her child's risk of developing atopic eczema, but better trials are needed.</P>
<P>Dietary antigen avoidance by lactating mothers of infants with atopic eczema may reduce the severity of the eczema, but larger trials are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-22 22:17:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atopic (allergic) diseases such as eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or both, (hay fever), and urticaria (hives) are known to have a strong genetic component, but the increased incidence and severity of asthma and perhaps of other atopic diseases over the last few decades (<LINK REF="REF-Upton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woolcock-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolcock 1997</LINK>) underlines the etiologic importance of environmental factors. Maternal dietary antigens are known to cross the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Loibichler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loibichler 2002</LINK>) and pass into breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Cant-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cant 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakobsson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakobsson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shannon-1921" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shannon 1921</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troncone-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troncone 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vadas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vadas 2001</LINK>). A recent study, however, found that inhalant and food antigen-specific IgE in cord blood reflected maternal IgE but was no longer present in the infant's blood at six months of age, suggesting that the infant is not sensitized to those antigens through in utero exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnelykke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnelykke 2008</LINK>). Some cases of atopic eczema in breastfed infants have been reported to improve following elimination of offending antigens ingested by the mother during lactation (<LINK REF="REF-Gerrard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerrard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Keefe-1920" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Keefe 1920</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1918" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1918</LINK>). The diagnosis of allergic diseases is somewhat subjective, and the clinical course of these diseases is highly variable. (Although positive skin prick tests to specific antigens indicate that the subject is allergic to those antigens and suggest a general atopic diathesis, persons with allergic diseases do not always react with positive skin tests, and many persons with positive skin tests do not exhibit signs or symptoms of these diseases.) Methodologically rigorous trials are therefore necessary to establish the efficacy of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy or lactation, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Zeiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeiger 2003</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of prescribing an antigen avoidance diet during pregnancy or lactation on the nutritional status of the mother and newborn and on the development of atopic disease in the child; positive skin prick tests to dietary antigens; and cord blood levels of IgE (a predictor of subsequent atopic disease). The main focus is on women at high risk for giving birth to an atopic child, based on a history of atopic disease in the mother, father, or a previous child.</P>
<P>The review also assesses the effects of prescribing an antigen avoidance diet to lactating mothers of infants with established atopic eczema on the severity of the eczema.</P>

<P>All acceptably controlled (randomized or quasi-randomized) comparisons of maternal dietary antigen avoidance prescribed to pregnant (at any time during pregnancy) or lactating women at high risk, regardless of degree (number of foods eliminated from the diet) or duration.

We have also included data on breastfed infants in trials in which the maternal antigen avoidance began during pregnancy and continued into the lactation period. We have excluded, however, trials of multimodal interventions that include, in addition to maternal dietary antigen avoidance, manipulation of the infant's diet other than breast milk or of other non-dietary aspects of the infant's environment (i.e., exposure to inhaled allergens).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-07-22 22:22:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two included trials on antigen avoidance diet during pregnancy are of uneven methodological quality. Only <LINK REF="STD-Falth_x002d_Magnusson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Falth-Magnusson 1987</LINK> provided details of the randomization procedure, and neither based its primary analysis on 'intention to treat', i.e., mothers who failed to comply with the antigen avoidance diet were not analyzed as part of their allocated group. In both trials, examinations of children at age 18 months were performed by physicians blind to treatment allocation. We excluded the five-year follow up of the trial by <LINK REF="REF-Falth_x002d_Magnusson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falth-Magnusson 1992</LINK> from analysis because the results are based on the diets actually followed, rather than those allocated by randomization.</P>
<P>Of the two trials of dietary antigen avoidance during lactation, <LINK REF="STD-Lovegrove-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lovegrove 1994</LINK> has methodologic shortcomings: details of the randomization procedure were not provided, and analysis was not based on 'intention to treat' (i.e., mothers who failed to comply with the antigen avoidance diet were not analyzed as part of their allocated group). Data were provided, however, on compliance with the experimental or control diet, and the physicians who examined study children for evidence for atopic disease were masked, although mothers may have unblinded them. Risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Appelt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Appelt 2004</LINK> is difficult to judge, because the information available is based solely on a published abstract that provides no details on the method of randomization or on losses to follow-up between randomization and one-year follow-up.</P>
<P>Although two separate trials on antigen avoidance diet for lactating mothers of infants with established atopic eczema are included in <LINK REF="STD-Cant-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cant 1986</LINK>, only the first was sufficiently well controlled to warrant inclusion in this review; it used a double-blind, randomized crossover design and is of acceptable quality. (The second trial was an unblinded, non-randomized crossover trial.) For the first (included) trial, the results were analyzed appropriately in the original publication using a paired t-test, but the data presented in the tables in this review are group means at the end of the exclusion (intervention) diet and common standard deviations (i.e., for all study subjects) at the end of the trial after four weeks back on the pre-trial diet.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-07-22 22:24:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials, involving 334 pregnant women, were included in the review of dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Falth_x002d_Magnusson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Falth-Magnusson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lilja-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lilja 1988</LINK>). The combined evidence from the trials does not suggest a strong protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance on the incidence of atopic eczema (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.79) or asthma (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.39 to 12.67) during the first 18 months of life. Data on allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or both, and urticaria are limited to a single trial each and are insufficient to draw meaningful inferences. Both trials suggest a lower incidence of positive skin prick tests to egg antigen at six months of age, but the effect was no longer evident at 18 months, nor was any benefit apparent at either age for skin prick tests to milk antigen. In the <LINK REF="STD-Lilja-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lilja 1988</LINK> trial, cord blood IgE levels were, if anything, higher in the experimental (antigen avoidance) group. Longer-term atopic outcomes have not been reported. Based on the single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Falth_x002d_Magnusson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Falth-Magnusson 1987</LINK>) providing pertinent data, the restricted diet during pregnancy was associated with a small but statistically significant lower mean gestational weight gain (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% CI -5.21 to -0.79) percentage of pre-pregnancy weight, i.e., 1.8 kg for a 60-kg woman). The pooled results of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Falth_x002d_Magnusson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Falth-Magnusson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovegrove-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lovegrove 1994</LINK>, the latter including an intervention that continued into lactation) suggest that maternal antigen avoidance may be associated with a higher (but statistically highly unstable) risk of preterm birth (RR 10.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 192.26) and a possible adverse effect on mean birthweight (MD -83.45, 95% CI -221.87 to 54.97).</P>
<P>One trial of antigen avoidance during lactation reporting on only 26 lactating women (<LINK REF="STD-Lovegrove-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lovegrove 1994</LINK>) found no significant protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance on the incidence of atopic eczema during the child's first 18 months of life (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.64). The two excluded Chandra trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chandra-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandra-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 1989</LINK>) both contributed data to this comparison in the original versions of this review. A larger included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Appelt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Appelt 2004</LINK>) did not report on atopic eczema or other allergic disease outcomes, but found no evidence of sensitization to milk, egg, or peanut antigen on skin-prick testing at one, two, or seven years of age.</P>
<P>One small crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cant-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cant 1986</LINK>) involving 17 lactating mothers found that dietary antigen avoidance by mothers of infants with established atopic eczema was associated with a non-significant reduction in eczema severity.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during pregnancy or lactation is unlikely to reduce substantially her risk of giving birth to an atopic child. More data are necessary on potential adverse effects of maternal antigen avoidance during pregnancy on gestational weight gain, fetal growth, and preterm birth.</P>
<P>The unimpressive results of the single trial assessing restricted diet for lactating mothers of infants with eczema should be interpreted with caution because of its small size (n = 17) and because the trial compared exposure to cow milk and egg with exposure to soya milk (soya can itself be allergenic). Future trials should be larger and should ensure adequate antigen restriction of the maternal diet.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-19 17:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during pregnancy or lactation is unlikely to reduce substantially her risk of giving birth to an atopic child and may have an adverse effect on maternal or fetal nutritional status, or both. The original version of this review suggested a possible benefit of antigen avoidance during lactation, but after exclusion of the two trials with suspected data fabrication, the evidence no longer suggests a beneficial effect.</P>
<P>As stated by the authors of the single trial of antigen avoidance in mothers of infants with atopic eczema, "most breastfed babies with eczema do not respond to maternal dietary manipulation." Even if this is so, maternal reports of changes in the severity of their breastfed infants' eczema following ingestion of certain foods should not be summarily dismissed. Rather, such reports should be pursued by performing multiple (preferably double-blinded) challenges and dechallenges with the suspected foods.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-22 15:29:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Future trials on the effect of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy will require much larger sample sizes to detect more modest reductions in risk of atopic disease in infants and children, and longer follow-up will be necessary to detect potential benefits on other atopic outcomes (i.e., allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis and asthma). More data are required on potential adverse effects of maternal antigen avoidance on gestational weight gain, fetal growth, and preterm birth.</P>
<P>As to the effects of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during lactation, better and larger trials are required, specifically with respect to allergic disease outcomes.</P>
<P>Finally, since adherence to an antigen avoidance diet during pregnancy and/or lactation requires considerable effort, more information is necessary on women's experience and compliance with such diets.</P>
<P>Future trials on the effects of antigen avoidance diet for lactating mothers of infants with established eczema should be larger and should ensure adequate antigen restriction of the maternal diet.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently evaluated trials under consideration for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion, without consideration of their results. We processed included trial data as described in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have not included <LINK REF="STD-Appelt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Appelt 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lovegrove-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lovegrove 1994</LINK> in the comparison of atopic outcomes for dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy, because the intervention continued into lactation.</P>
<P>We have excluded from this update two trials by Chandra et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chandra-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandra-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 1989</LINK>) included in the original versions of this review because of evidence that the published data may have been fabricated.</P>
<P>Because of the small sample sizes of trials and large differences in the control rates of atopic outcomes, all pooled effect estimates are derived from random-effects models even in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity in the results of the pooled trials.</P>
