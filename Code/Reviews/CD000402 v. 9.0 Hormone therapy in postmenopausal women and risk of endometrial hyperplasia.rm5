<P>Hormone therapy may be used to manage troublesome menopausal symptoms, but is currently recommended to be given at the lowest effective dose and regularly reviewed by a woman and her doctor. In women with an intact uterus hormone therapy comprising estrogen and progestogen is desirable to minimise the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which can develop into endometrial cancer. Low-dose estrogen plus progestogen (minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) taken daily (continuously) appears to be safe for the endometrium. For women who had their last menstrual period less than one year ago low-dose estrogen combined sequentially with 10 days of progestogen (1 mg norethisterone acetate) per month appears to be safe for the endometrium.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-04 19:52:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-05 08:28:55 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Menopause means the cessation of menstruation and typically occurs in women aged between 45 and 55 years with a mean age of about 51 years. Women are said to be postmenopausal when menstruation has ceased for six to 12 months and blood serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increase to at least 49 IU/L. The decline in circulating estrogen around the time of the menopause can induce symptoms that affect the well-being and health of women; hot flushes, insomnia, declining bone mass, night sweats, mood disturbances and vaginal dryness have all been reported. Estrogen therapy has been utilised for the treatment of many of the menopausal symptoms, particularly hot flushes and vaginal dryness. As life expectancy and the proportion of older adults in the population increase, there has been an increased focus on the effects of ageing.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-05 09:31:52 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormone therapy (HT) may consist of unopposed estrogen or a combination of estrogen plus progestogen (E+P).</P>
<P>Unopposed estrogens include conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), ethinyl estradiol (EE), micronised 17&#946;-estradiol (E2), estradiol valerate (EV), estrone sulphate (EIS) and esterified estrogens (ESE). These estrogens cannot be considered equal. They vary in their dose equivalency and have different metabolic effects on different tissues or end organs. In order to make meaningful comparisons estrogens were grouped into low, moderate and high doses according to the advice of experts (<LINK REF="REF-Ansbacher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansbacher 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-France-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">France 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1998</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>There are a number of different progestogens used in HT, which can be classified according to their structure and bioactivity, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrie 2011</LINK>). These include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>micronised progesterone (MP), dydrogesterone (DYG; a retroprogesterone), and progesterone derivatives such as medrogestone (MG);</LI>
<LI>pregnanes such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), megestrol acetate (MA), cyproterone acetate (CPA);</LI>
<LI>norpregnanes such as trimegestone (TMG), nestorone and promegestone;</LI>
<LI>estranges such as norethisterone, norethisterone acetate (NETA) and lynestrol, derived from testosterone and collectively known as first-generation progestogens;</LI>
<LI>gonane progestogens, which can be divided into two categories - the second-generation progestogens such as norgestrel (NG), levonorgestrel (LNG) and the third-generation progestogens, such as desogestrel (DG), gestodene, norgestimate (NGM) and dienogest (DNG);</LI>
<LI>drospirinone (DSP) - a new progestogen derived from spironolactone not included in the generation classification.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Some progestogens are prodrugs that are metabolised by the liver into active compounds. Examples are promegestone which is converted to TMG, and NGM which is converted to NG.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:36:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have suggested a causal relationship between unopposed estrogen therapy (daily use of estrogen without the addition of progestogen) and the development of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Antunes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antunes 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardan-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grady-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziel-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziel 1975</LINK>). Endometrial hyperplasia is regarded as a precursor of endometrial cancer but progression is dependent on the type of hyperplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Kurman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kurman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terakawa-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terakawa 1997</LINK>). The estimated risk of hyperplasia progression to cancer is 1%, 3%, 8% and 29% for women with simple, complex, simple atypical and complex atypical hyperplasia, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Kurman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurman 1985</LINK>). The risk of hyperplasia and carcinoma appears to increase with higher doses and increased duration of unopposed estrogen treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2005</LINK>). Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy significantly reduces the risk of hyperplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Corson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Corson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cust-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cust 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Udoff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udoff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1977</LINK>), but can result in premenstrual symptoms that are problematic for some women. These symptoms and increased bleeding and spotting with both types of HT regimens are often given as a reason not to continue HT (<LINK REF="REF-Ellerington-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellerington 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2001</LINK>). An additional concern is that the addition of progestogen to estrogen also appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a result of evidence suggesting that HT is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer in women aged over 55 years (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>), current advice is that HT not be used for chronic disease prevention. HT is an effective treatment for women with menopausal symptoms of hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and the duration of therapy should be decided for individual women based on an assessment of both benefits in terms of menopausal symptom management, and harms of therapy such as venous thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-Hickey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2007</LINK>). The duration of treatment with HT should be reviewed by a woman with her doctor, because for most women hot flushes resolve within one year of onset of the menopause. About one third of women will continue to have vasomotor symptoms for up to five years and some women for even longer (<LINK REF="REF-Hickey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickey 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>HT is usually taken orally, but there are also other modalities including transdermal (patches, gels and creams), subcutaneous (implants), intranasal, vaginal and intrauterine. This review will consider only oral HT and the other modalities will be covered in separate reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>The original version of this review investigated abnormal vaginal bleeding, and concluded as follows:</B>
</P>
<P>Regular withdrawal bleeding is expected with a sequential regimen of E+P but women appear to experience less irregular bleeding than with a continuous E+P regimen. Irregular bleeding or spotting is common in the first year of continuous E+P but following the first year of treatment, bleeding and spotting become more common in sequential E+P regimens. A large proportion of women taking continuous E+P become amenorrhoeic after one year of therapy while withdrawal bleeding continues for women taking sequential regimens.</P>
<P>Bleeding during the first year of continuous E+P therapy does not need investigation with vaginal ultrasound scan, endometrial thickness or endometrial biopsy (or a combination of these), but these investigations should be considered in the second and subsequent years of HT. Unscheduled bleeding on sequential HT should be investigated by hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>For the 2008 and subsequent updates of this review, we have addressed long-term endometrial safety outcomes rather than bleeding patterns, and have amended the protocol accordingly</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to assess which of the oral HT regimens, unopposed estrogen or E+P administered either continuously or sequentially, provides the best protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, has better adherence to therapy regimens and the lowest rate of unscheduled biopsies. In addition we aimed to compare the effects of different types, doses and duration of progestogen use on both endometrial hyperplasia and adherence to treatment, in order to determine the minimum dose and duration of progestogen required for endometrial protection.<BR/>

The allocations of different types and doses of estrogens to these groupings were made according to the literature and the advice of experts (<LINK REF="REF-Ansbacher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansbacher 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-France-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">France 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1998</LINK>) and are set out in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. However, disagreement persists among clinical experts regarding categorisation of E2 in the moderate range and two different doses (1.5 mg and 2 mg) of this estrogen have sometimes been included in this category. From the information available (<LINK REF="REF-Ansbacher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansbacher 1994</LINK>) 0.010 mg EE can be considered equivalent to 0.625 mg CEE and can be considered a moderate dose. Consequently we have modified the categorisation of EE doses in this update of the review.</P>
<P>The progestogens also vary in dose equivalency and metabolic effects on different tissues. As all progestogens share the effect of inducing a structural change in estrogen-primed endometrium, the potency of a progestogen can be expressed by the difference in dose required in order to achieve this transformation. Estimates of potency based on animal studies give a "transformation dose" per cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2000</LINK>). However, the serum level resulting from administration of progestogen to women is dependent on a number of variables including the mode of administration, absorption, metabolism, distribution and storage in fat and other tissues, binding to serum proteins, inactivation and conjugation. We were unable to find empirical evidence as to a 'transformation dose' per cycle in women. In this review we attempted to order the progestogens based on estimates of their relative potency from animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2000</LINK>) as there are few data from studies in humans as to dose equivalency of progestogens used in HT.</P>
<P>In the analysis, continuous and sequential E+P regimens were evaluated separately. For each type of regimen, different doses were compared.</P>
<P>There is evidence that progestogens must be taken for at least 10 days per month to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1981</LINK>), though some studies suggest that progestogens should be given for at least 12 to 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Archer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Archer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturdee-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturdee 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1987</LINK>). It was planned to assess separately the effects of sequential progestogen given for less than and more than 10 days per cycle.</P>
<P>The effects of sequential therapy were evaluated separately for different doses and duration of progestogen treatment, and for different treatment regimens (monthly sequential, long cycle (three monthly sequential) and intermittent (three days estrogen only followed by three days E+P, repeated).</P>

<P>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Where it was clinically appropriate, study outcomes were pooled statistically. It was planned to use a fixed-effect model for calculation of summary effects in the meta-analysis. Where significant heterogeneity was demonstrated it was planned to calculate summary effects using a random-effects model to take account of the added uncertainty.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. proportion of participants with hyperplasia or carcinoma), results for each study were expressed as an OR with 95% CIs and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method. All outcomes apart from adherence to therapy were categorised so that a high value represented a harm or negative consequence rather than a benefit of treatment.

<P>Most of the included trials specified that women be postmenopausal and this was defined in 32 trials as cessation of bleeding for six months or more prior to entry into the study. In two trials postmenopausal was defined as serum FSH &#8805; 40 IU/L (<LINK REF="STD-CHART-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CHART 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2001</LINK>), in four trials postmenopausal was defined as serum FSH "in the postmenopausal range" (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Nand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nand 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2004</LINK>) and in one trial postmenopausal was defined as estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwald-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwald 2005</LINK>). Seven studies did not define postmenopausal (<LINK REF="STD-Byrjalsen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Byrjalsen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Byrjalsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Byrjalsen 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavia 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Stadberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stadberg 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>) and in one trial the inclusion criteria specified that participants be older than 65 years and consequently postmenopausal (<LINK REF="STD-Prestwood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prestwood 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants ranged in age from 40 to 75 years although in most studies women were in the early menopause with the requirement that women should be within five or less years of their last spontaneous menstrual bleeding. Results can thus be generalised only to women in the early postmenopause rather than all postmenopausal women. Most of the trials also required that women have an intact uterus, or this was implied by the requirement for an endometrial biopsy at baseline, exclusion criterion of previous gynaecological operation or the nature of the primary outcomes. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for each study are found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Common exclusion criteria were malignancy, chronic illness or use of contraindicated medications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>A wide variety of unopposed estrogen or estrogen + progestogen combinations were used as interventions in the included trials. Unopposed estrogens included CEEs, EV, EIS, ESEs, micronised E2 and piperazine oestrone sulphate (POS). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CHART-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CHART 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2003</LINK>) compared placebo with unopposed EE at four different doses and with the same doses continuously combined with NETA. Most of the unopposed estrogen studies compared different doses of the same drug with placebo.</P>
<P>A number of different progestogens were used in the studies included in this review. In alphabetical order these included CPA, DG, DNG, DSP, DYG, gestodene, MPA, MA, NG, NETA, NGM, LNG and TMG.</P>
<P>In some trials, unopposed estrogen treatment was compared with estrogen plus progestogen (E+P) combined treatment, either continuous or sequential.</P>
<P>Sequential combined regimens of HT may be divided into four main types. The most common regimens use unopposed estrogen for part of the cycle followed by E+P for 10 to 15 days per monthly cycle (28 to 30 days). Alternatively there are experimental regimens that use intermittent progestogen (i.e. estrogen only for three days) followed by E+P for three days repeated for up to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Byrjalsen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Byrjalsen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Corson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2001</LINK>). Some studies have used regimens where progestogen is added for 10 to 12 days every two or three months (<LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>) or every six months (<LINK REF="STD-Prestwood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prestwood 2003</LINK>) (long-cycle regimens). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2004</LINK>) a biphasic regimen comprising 11 days of unopposed estrogen and 10 days of E+P followed by seven days of placebo, was compared with a triphasic regimen comprising 12 days of unopposed estrogen followed by 10 days of E+P, followed by six days of lower-dose estrogen only. The biphasic regimen in this study was similar to the cyclical regimens that were originally used in HT but were found to be unsatisfactory for women because the troublesome menopausal symptoms returned during the seven-day placebo phase.</P>
<P>In this review, duration of progestogen therapy varied from 10 to 14 days and it was given at differing times in the treatment cycle.</P>
<P>Where there was only one comparison group of unopposed estrogen and two or more groups with different E+P doses (<LINK REF="STD-MSG-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MSG 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>), we chose to use subtotals only, to avoid double counting the comparison group. Likewise, in evaluating the effects of combined E+P, both continuous and sequential, where there was only one comparison group the analyses use subtotals only.</P>
<P>Seventeen of the trials had a placebo control group. Five studies had an estrogen-only group as the comparison with combined regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Archer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Archer 2005</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Corson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Corson 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Gelfand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gelfand 1989;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MSG-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MSG 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>).

<P>Duration of treatment in the included trials ranged from 12 months to six years but the majority of studies assessed treatment over either one or two years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes were frequency of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. Some studies assessed endometrial thickness by ultrasound and only performed a biopsy where endometrial thickness was greater than 5 mm. This would appear to be common clinical practice. Endometrial hyperplasia was invariably confirmed by endometrial biopsy and reported at 12, 24 and 36 months. Most studies included any type of hyperplasia as a hyperplasia outcome.</P>
<P>A subgroup of women from the Women's HOPE study were followed up for two years and there were no additional cases of endometrial hyperplasia in the second year except in the women on unopposed estrogen. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2001</LINK>) participants were initially randomised to treatment for one year and then an open-label extension study followed for a second year. Only 65% of those women initially randomised had endometrial biopsies at the end of the second year.</P>
<P>Incidence of endometrial carcinoma was measured as an outcome by 14 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Azzawi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Azzawi 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Byrjalsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Byrjalsen 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koninckx-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Koninckx 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kurman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kurman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meuwissen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meuwissen 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MSG-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MSG 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-OPAL-2006" TYPE="STUDY">OPAL 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavia 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>) at different time points: after one, two, three or more than five years of treatment.</P>
<P>A small number of trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OPAL-2006" TYPE="STUDY">OPAL 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2001</LINK>) assessed change in bone density, lipid profile, carotid artery or climacteric symptoms as the primary outcomes. Effects on the endometrium and frequency of unscheduled bleeding were secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>The frequency of unscheduled biopsies or dilation and curettage was measured in one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>), and non-adherence to treatment as measured by pill counts was assessed in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2004</LINK>). However, there were significant numbers of participants in most of the trials who withdrew from the trial prior to completion (10% to 50%), owing to adverse events, lack of efficacy or other reasons.</P>

<P>Losses to follow-up and withdrawals were common, particularly in the larger trials and trials with long duration. In the CHART study, 570 women (45%) had withdrawn (out of a total of 1265) by the conclusion of the trial at two years. In this trial, a priori stopping rules were applied for participants who developed hyperplasia and consequently a proportion of subjects in group 8 (10 &#956;g daily of oral unopposed EE continuously) were terminated from the study early owing to a high rate of hyperplasia. All remaining treatment groups had similar rates of withdrawal that ranged from 22% to 30% and excluding the high-dose estrogen group, over 73% of the subjects completed the study (<LINK REF="STD-CHART-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CHART 1996</LINK>).

<P>Where more than 20% of women withdrew during the course of the study (owing to adverse events or other reasons such as change of address and unwillingness to continue to participate) there was a correspondingly low rate of endometrial biopsy. High rates of withdrawals and losses to follow-up thus reduced the power of the study to detect the primary outcome of interest to this systematic review.</P>

Academics are then invited to become the 'authors' of these pre-written articles that contain the desired marketing messages - a practice known as 'ghost-writing'. The extent of this practice is unclear, but there is evidence that three major articles published about the <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2001</LINK> study, which provided data for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Archer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Archer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Utian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utian 2001</LINK>) were 'ghost-written' (<LINK REF="REF-Fugh_x002d_Berman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugh-Berman 2010</LINK>).

<P>We extracted data on the cumulative incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at 12, 24 and 36 months. Not all of the studies reported the incidence rates at these time intervals. No differentiation was made in the analysis between the type of hyperplasia (simple, atypical or complex), although this was reported in some studies. Where a study had only one comparison or control group and several different doses in the experimental group, we used subgroups only and did not combine the results, in order to avoid counting the control group more than once.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Throughout this systematic review there is a high level of clinical heterogeneity owing to variations in the populations of women included, for example in age, years since menopause, and the variety of HT doses and regimens compared. We have attempted to deal with this by separating out the regimens and doses, which has had the undesirable effect of reducing the potential for meta-analysis. For example, when unopposed estrogen was compared with continuous estrogen and progesterone there were 13 different regimens used in six RCTs. We chose to display each regimen separately, which meant that only three of the 13 regimens had more than one trial contributing data.<BR/>Where data were pooled, statistical heterogeneity was absent or low for all analyses reporting endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, except for analysis 1.2.2 (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 56%). There was also moderate heterogeneity for the outcome 'withdrawals owing to adverse events' in three analyses (Analysis 1.7.2, Analysis 2.9.8, Analysis 7.4.9; I<SUP>2 </SUP>55% to 66%). There were no obvious design differences between the studies to account for the heterogeneity. When continuous E+P was compared with sequential E+P therapy for 'withdrawal owing to adverse events', significant heterogeneity was also evident from the forest plot. We did not calculate a pooled estimate here as only one of the four trials was considered to have a low risk of bias.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 09:46:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unopposed estrogen therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at two and three years at all doses and there was evidence of a dose-response relationship and a duration of treatment-response relationship between unopposed estrogen and risk of hyperplasia. After one year of treatment, low-dose unopposed estrogen was associated with a marginally non-significant increase in endometrial hyperplasia compared to placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The addition of progestogen to unopposed estrogen therapy in women with intact uteri significantly reduced the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, when either sequential or continuous combined regimens were adopted. The results confirm that after one year of therapy, continuous combined E+P at any of the doses used in the trials is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of endometrial hyperplasia when compared to unopposed estrogen regimens. After two years of therapy, low-dose estrogen plus either 1.5 or 2.5 mg MPA showed a statistically significant reduction in odds of hyperplasia compared to unopposed estrogen, but there was insufficient power to determine the endometrial safety of 1 to 5 g EE combined with 0.2 to 1 mg NETA.</P>
<P>The review also found that when unopposed estrogen was compared to continuous E+P there was an increased odds of endometrial cancer in the unopposed estrogen group.</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of developing endometrial hyperplasia in all the sequential combined E+P regimens compared with unopposed estrogen therapy. The duration of progestogen in the included studies in this review ranged from 10 to 14 days. Our review confirms the finding that doses of progestogen in sequential therapy need to be given for at least 10 days, as reported by a large case-control study (<LINK REF="REF-Pike-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pike 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies that reported the outcome of endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="STD-MSG-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MSG 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>) showed no difference in odds of developing endometrial cancer between women receiving unopposed estrogen and those receiving sequential combined regimens. However these women were closely monitored throughout the trial and if a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia was made, study treatment was stopped and appropriate treatment was provided.</P>
<P>One large trial (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>) of continuous E+P versus placebo found that the annualised incidence of endometrial cancer in the E+P group was 0.06% compared with 0.07% in the placebo group after a mean 5.6 years of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). The risk of endometrial cancer was not significantly different in the two groups but endometrial cancer is an uncommon event and an adequate assessment of this risk is unlikely to be made within the context of the limited time frame of the number of trials included in this review (maximum six years, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>). It should also be noted that if a woman in the <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK> trial developed endometrial hyperplasia of any type, HT was stopped and treatment of hyperplasia undertaken. The low rates of endometrial cancer in both groups show the value of regular monitoring of women taking HT.</P>
<P>In the trials that compared continuous combined regimens directly with sequential regimens (comparison 6) there was no statistically significant difference in the odds of endometrial hyperplasia after one, two or three years. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of endometrial cancer after up to three years. However, the sequential regimens included in these comparisons were quite varied and there were insufficient data to determine the relative merits of the different types of regimens used. There was no difference with regard to the outcome of adherence, withdrawal owing to adverse events or in the rate of unscheduled biopsies between the continuous and sequential regimens compared.</P>
<P>The comparisons between the various continuous combined regimens found no statistically significant differences with regard to endometrial hyperplasia because all the regimens included in these comparisons were associated with very low rates of hyperplasia. There were no cases of endometrial cancer in the two studies that reported this outcome but the follow-up period in each was only one year.</P>
<P>Long- (or very long) cycle sequential therapy (progestogen given once every three months) was compared with short-cycle sequential therapy (progestogen given once a month) in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prestwood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prestwood 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scandinavia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavia 1996</LINK>), where the long-cycle group received moderate-dose estrogen (2 mg E2 + 1 mg NETA for 10 days every three months, the rate of endometrial hyperplasia was so unexpectedly high in the first year (7.5%) that the trial was stopped early (mean duration of long-cycle therapy 2.8 years compared with the planned five years).</P>
<P>This finding was not evident in two small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>), which found no statistically significant difference between long-cycle and short-cycle groups in the rate of endometrial hyperplasia after one or two years of HT. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Prestwood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prestwood 2003</LINK>), which compared placebo with ultra-low-dose estrogen plus 14 days of progesterone (0.25 mg E2 +100 mg MP) given every six months (very long cycle), showed no statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to endometrial hyperplasia after three years of therapy.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> study found a marginally statistically significant difference in the rate of endometrial hyperplasia at two years between women receiving sequential therapy and those receiving placebo, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. After three years of treatment there was no statistically significant difference between these groups.</P>
<P>Adherence to therapy and the acceptability of therapy regimens to women are estimated and interpreted differently in the trials included in this review. We have chosen to define adherence to therapy as occurring when women take more than 80% of prescribed hormone doses as measured by counts of remaining tablets at clinic visits. Only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>) compared unopposed estrogen with combined regimens and reported adherence to therapy. Adherence was greater in both continuous and sequentially combined regimens than in unopposed estrogen regimens.</P>
<P>Withdrawals owing to adverse events and unscheduled biopsies were more likely in women receiving unopposed estrogen than in those receiving either continuous or sequential combined therapy. Unscheduled biopsies are more likely to be performed where there is concern about endometrial stimulation and consequent hyperplasia.</P>

<P>The assessment of endometrial hyperplasia in this review is clinically important because it is associated with an overall increased risk of endometrial cancer, although this risk differs according to the type of hyperplasia diagnosed. There is evidence that untreated simple hyperplasia without atypia progresses infrequently over a 13-year period to carcinoma while the risk of progression to carcinoma is greater in women with complex hyperplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Kurman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kurman 2000</LINK>). Untreated hyperplasia with atypia is more likely to progress to cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Kurman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kurman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terakawa-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terakawa 1997</LINK>). Most of the trials included in this review have distinguished 'hyperplastic' endometrium of any type from other types of endometrium<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>This review is restricted to trials of oral HT. However it should be noted that intrauterine progestogen-releasing systems are available, and can be used in combination with oral estrogen in HT. Intrauterine progestogen-releasing systems induce profound endometrial suppression and may overcome many of the problems of sensitivity to systemic progestogens while also offering benefits such as control of heavy menstrual bleeding and contraception in perimenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Raudaskoski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raudaskoski 2002</LINK>). There is a need for trials to evaluate the benefits and harms of intrauterine progestogen-releasing systems used in combination with low-dose oral estrogen for both short- and longer-term HT in peri- and postmenopausal women.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-05 10:23:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the strengths of this review is the grouping of a number of different estrogenic preparations together with approximately similar endometrial effects. A further outcome of this review is a list of minimum progestogen doses that have been found to safely 'oppose' these estrogen doses with regard to preventing the development of endometrial hyperplasia (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Most of the studies included in this review (70%) are at unclear risk of bias, and in the majority of these, the reason is inadequate reporting of the method of sequence generation and allocation concealment. More than half the included studies are at unclear risk of attrition bias owing to the large numbers of withdrawals. This is a common problem in studies of HT. We have assumed that participants who withdrew from the studies during the treatment period were free from hyperplasia or endometrial cancer, because these would cause symptoms that would need to be investigated. Consequently the event rates reported in this review are a conservative estimate of these harms.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-05 10:12:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A potential bias in this review process concerns the decision to include only trials that reported the outcomes of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. The harmful outcomes of HT are only one of many outcomes reported in trials of HT and we have been selective in our inclusion criteria for this review. In part this is a pragmatic response to the very large volume of literature on this topic. However in general there is evidence to suggest that biased reporting of the outcomes of treatment results in the under-reporting of harmful outcomes, so we believe that in this review, the selection of included studies is an attempt to redress that balance.</P>
<P>We have noted that the practice of 'ghost-writing' resulted in marketing messages being included in trials to help 'sell HRT' as a treatment for postmenopausal women. However we do not believe that 'ghost-writing' is a threat to the validity of this review, as we are extracting data from the included studies but not taking their marketing messages into consideration.</P>
<P>In order to meet the objectives of this review we have presented separate analyses with little pooling of data. It is likely that this approach is associated with low power to detect the outcome of interest, unless and until further trials are conducted and can be added to this review in future updates.</P>

<P>Previous studies and reviews have documented an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use of unopposed estrogen, rising with higher doses and longer duration of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Grady-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mack-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mack 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziel-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziel 1975</LINK>). Large RCTs found that combined therapy was not associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer (no increase in risk was associated with combined HT (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>). Authors noted that prevention of endometrial hyperplasia requires adequate dose and duration of progestogen use (<LINK REF="REF-Grady-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 1995</LINK>).</P>

<UL>
<LI>The evidence that unopposed estrogen therapy increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia shows a consistent association between the level of risk and the duration and strength of the dose. As low-dose unopposed estrogen was associated with an increase in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia over placebo at one year's duration that bordered on statistical significance, clinicians utilising this dose for this short time frame should monitor the endometrial thickness by ultrasound. Best practice is to use both E+P in women with a uterus. There was no evidence of an increase in endometrial hyperplasia at three years associated with ultra-low-dose estrogen (0.25 mg E2) <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="STD-Prestwood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prestwood 2003</LINK>) and progesterone for 15 days every six months. However there were no data to support that ultra-low-dose oral E2 would be adequate for symptom relief, as the primary outcome in this study was bone protection. Other research though has found a microdose of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg/day) to be more effective than placebo for relief of hot flushes (<LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Low-dose EE (5 &#956;g) required 1 mg NETA continuously to protect the endometrium (<LINK REF="STD-CHART-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CHART 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2003</LINK>). EE, commonly used in the oral contraceptive pill, has a pronounced effect on hepatic metabolism, and is now rarely used for HT in postmenopausal women.</LI>
<LI>Advice regarding HT for women with troublesome menopausal symptoms is to use the lowest effective dose and determine the duration of therapy based on an estimation of the benefits and harms for each individual woman. A previous meta-analysis of 35,000 women found the median duration of menopausal flushes to be around four years (<LINK REF="REF-Politi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Politi 2008</LINK>) with 10% of women reporting symptoms up to 12 years after the last period. A more recent cohort study of 4000 women followed for 13 years has suggested that the median duration may indeed be 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>). For many women low-dose HT gives adequate relief of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Peeyananjarassri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeyananjarassri 2005</LINK>). However, at the time of writing not all countries have generally available packaged low-dose sequential and combined continuous regimens. In this situation clinicians will need to separately prescribe the progestogen in doses that give endometrial protection.</LI>
<LI>The combined continuous regimen is suitable for women who are more than one to two years post menopause; use for women in early menopause can lead to unacceptable bleeding patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 1999a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>This systematic review has shown that 1.5 mg of MPA given continuously with 0.3 mg of CEE will give endometrial protection (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). However because this particular dose of MPA is not currently manufactured, clinicians will need to prescribe the 2.5 mg MPA tablet as this is the minimum dose available. For E2 this systematic review shows that 0.1 mg of NETA taken continuously will give endometrial protection (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However the commonly available product is currently one progestogen-only pill containing 0.35 mg norethisterone.</LI>
<LI>Sequential regimens are suitable for women in early menopause. The RCTs included in this review with sequential regimens using low-dose estrogen use regimens with types and doses of progestogens not commonly available as separate tablets <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). This makes separate prescribing of low-dose sequential HT problematic. A low-dose sequential product containing 1 mg E2 together with 10 days of 1 mg NETA is manufactured, but may not be available in all countries.</LI>

<P>Many of the studies in this review are small and lack statistical power, and others recruited larger numbers of women but high rates of attrition for various reasons resulted in small numbers of women having endometrial biopsies after two or three years of treatment. Larger studies examining the endometrial safety of short-term use (&#8804; one year) of unopposed low-dose estrogen would help to determine the safety of this regimen.</P>
<P>Data are also lacking regarding endometrial safety with sequential regimens containing low doses of estrogen with the more commonly available progestogens, which would be the treatment of choice for perimenopausal women. Results from such studies would aid clinicians who wish to individually prescribe low-dose hormone combinations in countries where these packaged regimens are not available.</P>

<P>
<B>The original version of this review investigated abnormal vaginal bleeding, and concluded as follows:</B>
</P>
<P>Regular withdrawal bleeding is expected with a sequential regimen of E+P but women appear to experience less irregular bleeding than with a continuous E+P regimen. Irregular bleeding or spotting is common in the first year of continuous E+P but following the first year of treatment, bleeding and spotting become more common in sequential E+P regimens. A large proportion of women taking continuous E+P become amenorrhoeic after one year of therapy while withdrawal bleeding continues for women taking sequential regimens.</P>
<P>While bleeding during the first year of continuous E+P therapy does not need investigation with vaginal ultrasound scan, endometrial thickness, endometrial biopsy, or a combination, these investigations should be considered in the second and subsequent years of HT. Unscheduled bleeding on sequential HT should be investigated by hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy.</P>
<P>
<B>For the 2008 update of this review, we addressed long-term endometrial safety outcomes rather than bleeding patterns, and we have amended the protocol accordingly </B>
</P>
<P>We assessed which of the oral HT regimens, unopposed estrogen or E+P administered either continuously or sequentially, provided the best protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, has better adherence to therapy regimens and the lowest rate of unscheduled biopsies. In addition we compared the effects of different types, doses and duration of progestogen use on both endometrial hyperplasia and adherence to treatment, in order to determine the minimum dose and duration of progestogen required for endometrial protection.</P>
<P>
<B>Amendments to the original protocol</B>
</P>
<P>For the 2008 update of this review, the protocol was been amended to include only studies with a minimum of 12 months of therapy with either unopposed estrogen or combined E+P. The primary outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma or both, with secondary outcomes of adherence to therapy, withdrawal owing to adverse events and rate of unscheduled investigations for abnormal bleeding (hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy). Bleeding patterns are no longer an outcome in this updated review.</P>
<P>For the 2012 update of this review there were no further changes to the protocol.</P>
