<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:58:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cochrane researchers conducted a review of the effects of nutritional supplements for people being treated for tuberculosis. After searching for relevant studies up to 4 February 2016, they included 35 relevant studies with 8283 participants. Their findings are summarized below.</P>
<P>
<B>What is active tuberculosis and how might nutritional supplements work?</B>
</P>
<P>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection which most commonly affects the lungs. Most people who get infected never develop symptoms as their immune system manages to control the bacteria. Active tuberculosis occurs when the infection is no longer contained by the immune system, and typical symptoms are cough, chest pain, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and sometimes coughing up blood. Treatment is with a combination of antibiotic drugs, which must be taken for at least six months.</P>
<P>People with tuberculosis are often malnourished, and malnourished people are at higher risk of developing tuberculosis as their immune system is weakened. Nutritional supplements could help people recover from the illness by strengthening their immune system, and by improving weight gain, and muscle strength, allowing them to return to an active life. Good nutrition requires a daily intake of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat), and micronutrients (essential vitamins and minerals).</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Effect of providing nutritional supplements to people being treated for tuberculosis</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We currently don't know if providing free food to tuberculosis patients, as hot meals or ration parcels, reduces death or improves cure (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). However, it probably does improve weight gain in some settings (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and may improve quality of life (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Routinely providing multi-micronutrient supplements may have little or no effect on deaths in HIV-negative people with tuberculosis (<I>low quality evidence</I>), or HIV-positive people who are not taking anti-retroviral therapy (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). We currently don't know if micronutrient supplements have any effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes (<I>very low quality evidence</I>), but they may have no effect on weight gain (<I>low quality evidence</I>). No studies have assessed the effect on quality of life.</P>
<P>Plasma levels of vitamin A appear to increase after starting tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. In contrast, supplementation probably does improve plasma levels of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium, but this has not been shown to have clinically important benefits. Despite multiple studies of vitamin D supplementation in different doses, statistically significant benefits on sputum conversion have not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Food or energy supplements may improve weight gain during recovery from tuberculosis in some settings, but there is currently no evidence that they improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes. There is also currently no reliable evidence that routinely supplementing above recommended daily amounts has clinical benefits.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-23 15:24:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis and malnutrition are linked in a complex relationship. Tuberculosis may cause undernutrition through increased metabolic demands and decreased intake, and nutritional deficiencies may worsen the disease, or delay recovery by depressing important immune functions. At present, there is no evidence-based nutritional guidance for adults and children being treated for tuberculosis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people being treated with antituberculous drug therapy for active tuberculosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-05-23 15:36:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 4 February 2016), EMBASE (from 1980 to 4 February 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to 4 February 2016), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the <I>Indian Journal of Tuberculosis</I> up to 4 February 2016, and checked the reference lists of all included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-05-07 04:04:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials that compared any oral nutritional supplement given for at least four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only for people being treated for active tuberculosis. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death, and cure at six and 12 months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-05-07 04:04:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. We presented the results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-20 13:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-five trials, including 8283 participants, met the inclusion criteria of this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Macronutrient supplementation</B>
</P>
<P>Six trials assessed the provision of free food, or high-energy supplements. Only two trials measured total dietary intake, and in both trials the intervention increased calorie consumption compared to controls.</P>
<P>The available trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.20; four trials, 567 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), cure (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.41; one trial, 102 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), or treatment completion (data not pooled; two trials, 365 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Supplementation probably produces a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis, although this was not seen consistently across all trials (data not pooled; five trials, 883 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Two small studies provide some evidence that quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (data not pooled; two trials, 134 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Micronutrient supplementation</B>
</P>
<P>Six trials assessed multi-micronutrient supplementation in doses up to 10 times the dietary reference intake, and 18 trials assessed single or dual micronutrient supplementation.</P>
<P>Routine multi-micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in HIV-negative people with tuberculosis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.6; four trials, 1219 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), or HIV-positive people who are not taking antiretroviral therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; three trials, 1429 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There is insufficient evidence to know if supplementation improves cure (no trials), treatment completion (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04; one trial, 302 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), or the proportion of people who remain sputum positive during the first eight weeks (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.35; two trials, 1020 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). However, supplementation may have little or no effect on weight gain during treatment (data not pooled; five trials, 2940 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), and no studies have assessed the effect on quality of life.</P>
<P>Plasma levels of vitamin A appear to increase following initiation of tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. In contrast, supplementation probably does improve plasma levels of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium, but this has not been shown to have clinically important benefits. Of note, despite multiple studies of vitamin D supplementation in different doses, statistically significant benefits on sputum conversion have not been demonstrated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:48:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:48:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, </I>which is spread from person to person by inhalation of respiratory droplets (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 2006</LINK>). In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were nine million new cases of active tuberculosis worldwide, and 1.5 million deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most people who are infected with <I>M. tuberculosis</I> develop what is known as latent tuberculosis. People with latent tuberculosis are infected with the bacterium <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I>, but the infection is contained by their immune system. These people remain well and do not exhibit any clinical signs or symptoms of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 2009</LINK>). The immune response to infection is complex, it initially involves the uptake of the bacterium into macrophage cells as part of the non-specific 'innate' immune response, and later recruitment of both B- and T-lymphocytes of the cellular immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Schluger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schluger 1998</LINK>). These cells isolate the bacterium as a granuloma, typically in the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active tuberculosis occurs when the infection is no longer contained by the immune system, and can occur at any time following infection. The lifetime risk of conversion from latent to active tuberculosis is around 5% to 10% in an otherwise healthy population (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 2006</LINK>), but this can rise to around 50% in people with severe impairment of their immune system, such as occurs with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (<LINK REF="REF-Zumla-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zumla 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis), but can also spread to affect the central nervous system, lymphatic system, circulatory system, genitourinary system, and bones and joints. The symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis include cough, chest pain, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and sometimes coughing up blood (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tuberculosis is treated with a combination of antibiotic drugs (antituberculous therapy), which must be taken for a period of at least six months to ensure success (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). If left untreated, around half of those with active tuberculosis will die of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Corbett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 2003</LINK>). With adequate treatment the mortality is around 5% globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>), although this may be higher in HIV-positive people (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2004</LINK>). The WHO target for successful cure in national tuberculosis control programmes is 85% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Throughout the world, poor nutritional status is more common in people with active tuberculosis than in people without tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-van-Lettow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Lettow 2003</LINK>), and weight loss, including loss of lean body mass, is a well-recognized symptom of the disease. Cohort and cross-sectional studies have suggested that active tuberculosis is commonly associated with low serum levels of important micronutrients such as zinc (<LINK REF="REF-Taneja-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taneja 1990</LINK>), and vitamins A, C, D, and E (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plit 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nnoaham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nnoaham 2008</LINK>). However, the measurement of serum vitamin levels during an acute infection, such as tuberculosis, is known to be unreliable, as transient abnormalities can occur (<LINK REF="REF-Louw-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louw 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The daily nutritional requirements for healthy individuals of all age groups are well described (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 2006</LINK>), and it is unlikely that people with active tuberculosis would require less than these recommended amounts. The two important questions are therefore whether tuberculosis patients require more, and whether these increased requirements should be provided as part of routine health care.</P>
<P>The effects of supplementation in people with HIV (but without tuberculosis) is covered in two other Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grobler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grobler 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-05-23 14:14:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nutritional requirements can be broadly divided into macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (essential vitamins and trace elements).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Macronutrients</HEADING>
<P>Each day the average 70 kg male requires approximately 2500 kilocalories (kcal) of energy to maintain body weight and composition; ideally consumed as 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>If it was shown that patients with active tuberculosis required additional macronutrients; these could be purchased and consumed by the patient simply following nutritional advice. However, in many situations, especially in low- and middle-income countries, the patient may not be able to acquire this additional food due to economic hardship through illness and loss of work, or due to local food insecurity (<LINK REF="REF-Kamolratanakul-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamolratanakul 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyss 2001</LINK>). In these situations healthcare services might provide increased nutrients through free provision of meals, take home rations, or specific high energy supplements. In many crisis or low-income settings this already happens and the World Food Programme (WFP) in particular is involved in many food support programmes for tuberculosis patients (<LINK REF="REF-WFP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WFP 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Micronutrients</HEADING>
<P>The daily micronutrient requirements for an adult male are given in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. These are usually expressed as the 'dietary reference intake' (DRI), and this is different for each individual micronutrient (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>These requirements can be gained from the consumption of a healthy, and varied diet, or through pharmaceutical supplementation as tablets, capsules, or powders. Any additional requirements could be gained through increased consumption following dietary advice, or through pharmaceutical provision via the health service or tuberculosis programme.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-05-09 10:27:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis and undernutrition interact in a two-way process. Tuberculosis can lead to weight loss and micronutrient deficiencies by increasing nutritional requirements, by changing metabolic processes, or by decreasing appetite and causing a reduction in food intake (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1999</LINK>). Alternatively, low body mass index (BMI; a measure of weight for height that is indicative of nutritional status) and some micronutrient deficiencies can depress cell-mediated immunity, the key host defence against tuberculosis, increasing the susceptibility to active tuberculosis and delaying recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Chandra-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachariah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachariah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cegielski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cegielski 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The micronutrients which have received the most attention are the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Vitamin A, which is involved in both T- and B-lymphocyte function, macrophage activity and the generation of antibody responses (<LINK REF="REF-Semba-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephensen 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Vitamin D, which is involved in the function of macrophages, a key component of the immune response to tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Wintergerst-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wintergerst 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Vitamin E, which has anti-oxidant properties and may protect against T-lympocyte failure due to oxidative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Wintergerst-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wintergerst 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Zinc, which is necessary for adequate functioning of many aspects of human immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Shankar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankar 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Selenium; which is essential for both cell-mediated and humoral immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Arthur-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Nutritional interventions, in people with active tuberculosis, therefore have the potential to do the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes; through restoration of cell-mediated immunity, increasing the individuals' ability to fight the infection and hastening recovery from the illness.</LI>
<LI>Promote nutritional recovery; with improved weight gain, restoration of muscle strength, function, and quality of life. Nutritional recovery is of great importance in tuberculosis treatment, allowing the patient to return to work, and recover economically as well as physically.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Food may also be given to people with tuberculosis for quite different reasons, such as; to promote adherence to treatment, or to mitigate the financial consequences of prolonged illness. Another Cochrane Review is addressing the use of food to promote adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Lutge-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutge 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, it is important to note that pathogens such as tuberculosis also require certain micronutrients for their own metabolism, and greater availability of these nutrients through supplementation could encourage their growth. There is some evidence for this in the case of iron (<LINK REF="REF-Lounis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lounis 2001</LINK>), and so nutritional interventions cannot be considered entirely benign.</P>

<P>There is currently no evidence-based guidance on food provision or supplementation for adults or children being treated for tuberculosis, with or without concurrent HIV infection.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Eleven of the 35 trials included less than 100 participants in their final analysis. To aid interpretation and inform future research we have calculated the optimal sample size to reliably demonstrate some suggested clinically important results (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>As micronutrients are a cheap and easily administered intervention, even a small effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes might be considered clinically important. For example, to demonstrate a reduction in death from the worldwide average of 5% to just 4% (a relative risk reduction of 20%); a sample size of over 13,000 participants would be necessary. This is far above the data included in this Cochrane Review. Similarly an increase in successful cure rate from 80% to 84% would require almost 3000 participants.</P>

<P>Six trials examined the effects of providing macronutrient supplements through the health service.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In Timor Leste, adults with pulmonary tuberculosis and a mean weight of 43.3 kg (31% of participants had a BMI of less than 16 kg/m²) were randomized to nutritional advice plus a daily cooked meal or nutritional advice alone (<LINK REF="STD-Martins-2009-TLS" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2009 TLS</LINK>). The daily midday meal (administered for two months during the intensive phase) consisted of a bowl of meat, kidney beans, and vegetable stew with rice. During the continuation phase participants in the supplement group also received a weekly food parcel containing unprepared red kidney beans, rice, and oil adequate for one meal per day.</LI>
<LI>In India, adults with pulmonary tuberculosis and a BMI of less than 19 kg/m² were randomized to receive a macronutrient and micronutrient supplement plus standard care versus standard care alone (<LINK REF="STD-Sudarsanam-2010-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Sudarsanam 2010 IND</LINK>). The supplement consisted of three daily servings of a cereal and lentil mixture (providing 930 kcal and 31.5 g protein) and a once-a-day multivitamin tablet. Participants were given a month's supply of supplement at a time.</LI>
<LI>The remaining four trials compared daily high energy supplements with: nutritional advice alone (<LINK REF="STD-Paton-2004-SGP" TYPE="STUDY">Paton 2004 SGP</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jahnavi-2010-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Jahnavi 2010 IND</LINK>); a single multi-micronutrient biscuit (<LINK REF="STD-Praygod-2011b-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Praygod 2011b TZA</LINK>); or no supplement (<LINK REF="STD-Jeremiah-2014-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Jeremiah 2014 TZA</LINK>). The supplements were described as 'sweetballs' (made from wheat flour, caramel, ground nuts, and vegetable ghee) (<LINK REF="STD-Jahnavi-2010-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Jahnavi 2010 IND</LINK>), high energy 'packets' (<LINK REF="STD-Paton-2004-SGP" TYPE="STUDY">Paton 2004 SGP</LINK>), and high energy 'biscuits' (<LINK REF="STD-Praygod-2011b-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Praygod 2011b TZA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeremiah-2014-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Jeremiah 2014 TZA</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). None of the studies estimated the total daily energy intake, but the supplement provided between 600 and 3690 kcal per day on top of the regular diet. All four studies recruited people with mean BMI below 20 kg/m².</LI>
</UL>
<P>Only two trials measured total dietary intake.

<P>Effects on weight gain were mixed (five trials, 689 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The daily hot meal was associated with an extra 1.7 kg weight gain at eight weeks (95% CI 0.1 to 3.2; P = 0.04; authors' own figures), and 2.6 kg at eight months (95% CI 0.1 to 5.2; P = 0.04; authors' own figures; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2009-TLS" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2009 TLS</LINK>), whereas the monthly ration pack was not associated with important differences (change in lean body mass, and percentage body fat were not significantly different between groups; P = 0.479 and P = 0.573 respectively; authors' own figures; <LINK REF="STD-Sudarsanam-2010-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Sudarsanam 2010 IND</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the trials evaluating high energy supplements, the two smaller trials in HIV-negative participants found that supplementation resulted in significantly more weight gain than advice alone at six weeks (MD 1.73 kg, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.65; one trial, 34 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and 12 weeks, respectively (MD 2.6 kg, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.46; one trial, 100 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Paton-2004-SGP" TYPE="STUDY">Paton 2004 SGP</LINK> further quantified this as an increase in lean body mass (MD 1.13 kg, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.89; one trial, 34 participants), with no significant difference in total fat mass. However, in Tanzania <LINK REF="STD-Praygod-2011b-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Praygod 2011b TZA</LINK> found no significant difference in weight gain with supplementation in HIV-positive participants at eight or 20 weeks (one trial, 332 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Macronutrient supplementation</HEADING>
<P>The included trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality, cure, or treatment completion (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). One small trial from India did find a statistically significant benefit on treatment completion, and clearance of the bacteria from the sputum, but these findings have not been confirmed in larger trials elsewhere.</P>
<P>The provision of free food or high-energy nutritional products probably does produce a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis, although this was not consistent across all included trials (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Two small studies provide some evidence that quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Micronutrient supplementation</HEADING>
<P>Multi-micronutrients may have little or no effect on mortality in HIV-negative people with tuberculosis (<I>low quality evidence</I>), and probably have little or no effect on mortality in HIV-positive patients who are not taking anti-retroviral therapy (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There is insufficient evidence to know if multi-micronutrients improve cure, treatment completion, or the proportion of tuberculosis patients remaining sputum positive during the first eight weeks (<I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Multi-micronutrients may have little or no effect on weight gain during treatment (<I>low quality evidence</I>), although one of the three studies did find a substantial benefit in one study arm. No studies assessed the effect of multi-micronutrient supplementation on quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Individual micronutrients</HEADING>
<P>Although low vitamin A levels are common in tuberculosis, plasma levels probably increase following initiation of tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. There is no evidence that supplementation in doses up to three times the DRI has a beneficial effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes, or nutritional recovery.</P>
<P>B vitamins have been given in doses up to 10 times the DRI as part of multi-micronutrient supplementation. There is no evidence of an effect on mortality from tuberculosis. Due to the paucity of trials we cannot make any further conclusions about the effect of this vitamin on other tuberculosis outcomes.</P>
<P>Vitamin C has only been evaluated as part of multi-micronutrient supplements. Doses of vitamin C up to five times the DRI had no effect on tuberculosis mortality. Due to the paucity of trials we cannot make any further conclusions about the effect of this vitamin on other tuberculosis outcomes.</P>
<P>Vitamin D supplementation appears to improve plasma levels compared to placebo when participants are deficient at the start of supplementation, but may not have any clinically important effects on early sputum conversion.</P>
<P>Vitamin E has only been assessed in combination with other vitamins or selenium. The dose used was up to 10 times the DRI. None of these trials show any significant benefit or harm with supplementation, but supplementation probably does improve blood levels of both vitamin E and selenium.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that plasma zinc levels increase during the first six months of supplementation, but no convincing evidence of other benefits.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:24:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies were generally too small and too limited to make broad conclusions on the presence or absence of clinically important benefits of nutritional supplementation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes.</P>
<P>Although the included studies are from low- and middle-income countries, they may not reflect the food-insecure settings where most supplementation programmes take place, and where the benefit may plausibly be greatest.</P>
<P>Where a supplement has so far not shown any benefit, this may also be an issue relating to the dose used as people recovering from tuberculosis may have micronutrient requirements which are higher than healthy people, however there is currently no evidence to support this.</P>
<P>In addition, it should be noted that most of the HIV-positive participants in these trials were not taking antiretroviral therapy.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-05-10 08:31:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE methodology, and displayed the results in two 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). 'Moderate' quality evidence implies we can have some confidence in the result, but further research evidence would still be helpful. 'Low' and 'very low' quality reflect decreasing levels of confidence in the result.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was mainly downgraded under 'directness' and 'precision'. Directness is an assessment of how well the evidence matches the PICO question being asked (population, intervention, control, outcome). Because nutritional deficiencies are likely to differ widely among populations, it is difficult to generalize the results of one or two trials to other settings or subgroups. Precision involves an assessment of the statistical and clinical significance of the result, and also whether the sample size of the trials is adequate to reliably detect an effect. Most of these trials were small and well below the optimal information size for the outcomes that were being measured.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-05-23 15:46:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We minimized biases in the review process by performing a comprehensive search of the literature for relevant published, unpublished, and ongoing trials and by independently selecting and appraising the studies, and extracting the data in duplicate. Where data was missing, we sought additional information and data directly from the study authors where this was possible to do so. We did not conduct an extensive hand-search for grey literature. Therefore, the review is at risk of publication bias from less prominent trials. We attempted to reduce this risk by identifying relevant conference abstracts and registered ongoing trials. The search of the trials registry to identify trial protocols and ongoing trials yielded 16 potentially relevant trial protocols. These will require further assessment and exploration to either: 1) link them to trials already included in the review; or 2) if not included, to attempt to obtain the completed trial reports. This task is time-consuming and has to be balanced against feasibility and time constraints.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:24:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nutritional supplementation in HIV-positive patients without tuberculosis has been assessed by two further Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grobler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grobler 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Grobler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grobler 2013</LINK> found 14 small trials that compared macronutrient supplementation with no supplementation and concluded that although there was evidence that supplementation increased both energy and protein intake, there was no evidence of a clinical benefit on either nutritional- or HIV-related outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK> assessed 30 trials that compared micronutrients with placebo from both developed and developing countries. The authors concluded that multi-micronutrient supplements have significant benefits in HIV-positive pregnant women and children. In children there was also evidence of a reduction in mortality with vitamin A, and a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity with zinc.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:24:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient research to know whether routinely providing free food or energy supplements results in better tuberculosis treatment outcomes, but limited evidence suggests it probably improves weight gain.</P>
<P>Although blood levels of some vitamins may be low in patients starting treatment for active tuberculosis, there is currently no reliable evidence that routinely supplementing above recommended daily amounts has clinical benefits.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:24:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High quality studies of food provision to tuberculosis patients in food-insecure settings are urgently needed to support the continued expenditure on food support to tuberculosis programmes. In designing these studies, researchers, and programme managers need to be clear about the aim of food provision. Whilst an effect on mortality would provide strong advocacy for continued financial support, if the primary aim is to promote adherence, or to mitigate the catastrophic financial consequences of the illness, then these are the outcomes that should be measured, and appropriate comparison interventions should be selected. If the primary aim is to reduce mortality, then future trials must be large enough to reliably detect or exclude an effect.</P>
<P>The failure to demonstrate a beneficial effect with micronutrient supplementation does not imply that one does not exist. Further studies, perhaps using higher doses, would still be beneficial but should have adequate sample sizes to reliably detect or exclude clinically important benefits. It would also be useful if some standardization of outcome measurements could be made.</P>
<P>For nutritional recovery it seems important to assess changes in weight and lean body mass during the first two months of treatment rather than as a single measure at the end of treatment. It is also essential that measures of how this translates into improved quality of life and physical functioning are made, as weight gain on its own is of little interest.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-05-31 10:24:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We amended the objective of this Cochrane Review from "To assess the provision of oral nutritional supplements to promote the recovery of people being treated with anti-TB drug therapy for active TB" to the current objective to simplify the wording and reflect the need to assess any differences in response depending on HIV status.</P>
<P>Also we changed some of the outcomes, as follows: we expanded "change in weight or skinfold thickness" to "change in weight, skinfold thickness, or other measure of lean or total mass" because we became aware that other measures, besides skinfold thickness, are equally valid indicators of overall nutritional status; we added "any measure of growth in children" because it is a useful indicator of health and nutritional status in children, which we had overlooked at the protocol stage; and included "sputum positive at follow-up" because it was a primary outcome of many included trials, and it became apparent that it is a meaningful outcome as, depending on the period of follow-up, it may be used as a proxy for cure or as an indicator of the time taken to become sputum-smear negative. Early sputum conversion is a desirable outcome because on becoming smear-negative, patients become less ill and less infectious to those around them.</P>
<P>Between the publication of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Abba-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abba 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 2011</LINK>), and this review update, the method of assessing and reporting risk of bias has changed slightly. We have adapted the methods to reflect this.</P>
<P>For this review update, we included additional details on the nutritional and micronutrient status at baseline. Where reported, we have also included plasma micronutrient levels during follow-up as an outcome. This outcome is not a patient important outcome, and is of little interest on its own, but does contribute to the understanding of the results.</P>

The exact composition of nutrients varied from 1 to 10 times the DRI. Three studies are from Tanzania, 1 from Malawi, and 1 from India. There is evidence of participants being significantly undernourished at baseline.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious inconsistency: statistical heterogeneity was low. Although the estimate of effect is trending towards a benefit this is due to 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Villamor-2008-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Villamor 2008 TZA</LINK>), the remaining trials found non significant trends in the opposite direction. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: the 95% CI of the pooled effect crosses 1 and includes a 2% absolute reduction in death which might be considered beneficial given the low cost of the intervention. The optimal information size to reliably detect a clinically beneficial effect if there is 1 is greater than 2000.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for indirectness: none of the participants in these trials were receiving antiretroviral therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Range-2005-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Range 2005 TZA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semba-2007-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Semba 2007 MWI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villamor-2008-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Villamor 2008 TZA</LINK>). The exact composition of nutrients varied from 1 to 10 times the DRI. Two studies are from Tanzania and 1 in Malawi. There is evidence of participants being significantly undernourished at baseline.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>No serious imprecision: the 95% CI of the pooled effect crosses 1 and does includes a 5% absolute reduction in death which might be considered beneficial given the low cost of the intervention. However, the effect estimate is of no difference between the treatments and the optimal information size to reliably detect a clinically beneficial effect is met.<BR/>

<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for imprecision. The 95% CI is wide and includes what may be clinically important effects.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for inconsistency: Statistical heterogeneity is very high. Four studies from Tanzania and India found no evidence of improved weight gain with supplements, while 1 study from Tanzania found large increases in weight with micronutrients at 8 months.<BR/>

<SUP>1</SUP>Globally the risk of death in tuberculosis patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis is around 5%.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Vitamins are relatively cheap and safe interventions, therefore even very modest reductions in the risk of death might be considered important.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>A sample size of 2000 participants (higher than any of the included studies) would be necessary to reliably detect even a very large relative reduction in death (50%).<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>A very high risk of death was seen in HIV-positive participants in some trials due to antiretrovirals being unavailable at the study site at the time. Death rates this high should not be seen in patients taking antiretrovirals.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>The target cure rate for directly observed treatment, short course (DOTs) programmes is 80%. The current global average is 86%.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Vitamins are relatively cheap and safe interventions, therefore even very modest increases in successful cure might be considered important.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Sputum positivity rates in these trials were very variable. These examples are for illustrative purposes only.</P>
<P>We performed the calculations using nMaster 1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-nMaster-1.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">nMaster 1.0</LINK>), a sample size software that incorporates sample size calculation(STATA, EpiInfo, nQuery, etc.), in terms of contents, each of use and the cost.<BR/>
