<P>Antidepressants can have numerous effects on sexual function including altered sexual desire, erection difficulties and orgasm problems. This systematic review investigated different ways to manage such sexual dysfunction. We included 23 randomised studies, with a total of 1886 participants who had developed their sexual problems while taking antidepressant medication. Twenty-two of these studies looked at the addition of further medication to the ongoing treatment for depression. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil (Viagra; three studies, 255 participants) or tadalafil (Cialis; one study, 54 participants) appeared to improve the situation. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction the addition of bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban; three studies, 482 participants) at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far, but further data from randomised trials are likely to be required before it can be recommended confidently. We did not find evidence that any intervention led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms; however, we cannot be confident of this for many of the interventions studied, as only small numbers of participants have been studied so far.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-11 11:58:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Sexual dysfunction (including altered sexual desire, orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction, erectile and other problems) is a relatively common side effect of antidepressant medication. These sexual side effects may compromise a person's lifestyle and result in a lack of compliance with the prescribed antidepressant to the detriment of the person's mental health. A wide range of management strategies are possible to address this problem, including behavioural, psychological and pharmacological approaches.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-04-12 10:45:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 1 January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Additional searches were carried out by the author team on the same biomedical databases (using terms for 'sexual dysfunction' only) together with CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2012). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-16 09:46:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 23 trials involving 1886 people in this updated review. Twenty-two of these trials investigated the addition of medication to treat the identified dysfunction, with most agents studied in only single studies. One study investigated switching to an alternative antidepressant.</P>
<P>In men, data for the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (three studies, 255 participants) and tadalafil (one study, 54 participants) indicated they led to a greater improvement in erectile function than placebo. Combined data from three sildenafil studies found benefit over placebo on International Index of Erectile Function ratings of ability to achieve (MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.44), and maintain erections (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59). A single point improvement on these ratings is equivalent to an improvement in frequency from 'sometimes' to 'most times'. Men receiving tadalafil were more likely to report improved erectile function (RR 11.50, 95% CI 3.03 to 43.67). For women it remains uncertain whether sildenafil is more effective than placebo. Unpublished data could reduce this uncertainty.</P>
<P>Data from three studies in men and women of bupropion 150 mg twice daily indicate a benefit over placebo on rating scale scores (SMD 1.60, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.81), but response rates in two studies of bupropion 150 mg once daily demonstrated no statistically significant difference in effect (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.41).</P>
<P>Other augmentation strategies failed to demonstrate significant improvements in sexual dysfunction compared with placebo.</P>
<P>One trial involving 75 people with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed the effect of changing antidepressant. Switching to nefazodone was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), however, nefazodone is no longer available for clinical use.</P>
<P>There is an absence of randomised trials assessing the effects of switching to currently-available antidepressant agents with lower rates of adverse sexual effects, the role of psychological or mechanical interventions, or of techniques such as drug holidays.</P>
<P>We identified no data for any of the strategies included in the trials assessed that indicated that they led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, the relatively small numbers assessed for many of the interventions studied means that the possibility of such an effect cannot confidently be excluded in all cases.</P>
<P>Given the small numbers of studies assessing most of the strategies assessed, the presence of any unpublished trials could have substantial effects on estimates of effect. In some cases, only results from particular items or subscales within ratings scales are available. It is likely that this could act to bias estimates of effect obtained, increasing apparent effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-11 12:04:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence currently available is rather limited. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil or tadalafil appears to be an effective strategy. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-12 12:17:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-12 12:17:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Antidepressant medications are widely prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Donoghue-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donoghue 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>). Sexual dysfunction is a common, well-known adverse effect of all antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Balon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>). These sexual adverse effects can affect a person's lifestyle considerably, and, where this results in reduced compliance with medication, lead to less effective treatment of the primary psychiatric disorder.</P>
<P>Several different types of sexual dysfunction may be related to antidepressants, including altered sexual desire - such as loss or lack of desire; orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction, including anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm), hyperorgasmia (significantly more orgasms in a short time period than normal), painful orgasm and inhibited ejaculation; erectile problems, including erectile dysfunction (impotence), priapism (significantly prolonged erection) and painful erection - and other issues, including problems of sexual arousal, reduced sexual satisfaction, lubrication, dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and vaginismus (tensing of vaginal muscles that make intercourse painful or impossible).</P>
<P>Identifying antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction can be complicated by the association of sexual dysfunction with some disorders that antidepressants are used to treat. For example, depression is associated with increased rates of reported sexual dysfunction even when no treatment is received (<LINK REF="REF-Angst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angst 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sexual dysfunction has been reported with all classes of antidepressant medication. Reported rates of sexual dysfunction are typically underestimates, as sexual adverse effects are often not specifically asked about in treatment trials, while direct questioning can reveal higher rates than are reported spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Montejo_x002d_Gonzalez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montejo-Gonzalez 1997</LINK>). Studies of the prevalence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction have exhibited a number of methodological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2002</LINK>). These include the frequent absence of comparison groups or baseline assessments, and inconsistent definitions of sexual dysfunction between studies.</P>
<P>The majority of studies directly comparing rates of sexual dysfunction between different antidepressants have involved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Generally, trials have reported no significant differences between these drugs in rates of sexual dysfunction, with sexual dysfunction reported in population surveys by over one third of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>). In randomised trials, nefazodone (a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor) and bupropion (a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) have been associated with less sexual dysfunction than the SSRI, sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feiger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feiger 1996</LINK>), and reboxetine (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) with greater sexual satisfaction than the SSRI fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 2003</LINK>). The monoamine oxidase inhibitor, moclobemide, was more commonly associated with increased sexual desire than the tricyclic antidepressant, doxepin (<LINK REF="REF-Philipp-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philipp 1993</LINK>). Further information on rates of sexual dysfunction with antidepressants can be found elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Gregorian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregorian 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serretti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serretti 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-08 10:12:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Management strategies described for the treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction include waiting for the problem to resolve; behavioural strategies modifying sexual technique; individual and couple psychotherapy; alterations of antidepressant usage, including reducing dose; delaying use until after sexual activity; 'drug holidays'; switching to a different antidepressant; and the use of additional agents (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2004</LINK>). A wide range of additional agents have been employed clinically to try to reverse this problem, for example erectile dysfunction might be treated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as sildenafil or tadalafil. However, additional treatments may themselves have adverse effects and tolerability problems, and could, in theory, affect the primary psychiatric condition for which the antidepressants were prescribed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-08 10:14:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The mechanisms by which antidepressants cause sexual dysfunction involve complex multi-system interactions, which are not entirely understood. Psychological factors such as anxiety may also play a role in maintaining dysfunction. The main neurotransmitters involved are serotonin (5HT), acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and dopamine. The adverse sexual effects may be caused centrally or peripherally and may result from the change in function of one or more neurotransmitter. Given this complex system, additional treatments employed have had a wide variety of putative mechanisms. Such treatments have included sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), amantadine (a dopamine agonist), cyproheptadine (an antihistamine and 5HT blocker), yohimbine (an alpha-2 blocker), buspirone (a 5HT1A receptor agonist), bethanechol (an acetylcholine agonist) and <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> (a herbal medication).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-04-08 10:17:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. That review noted that the available evidence was rather limited, with small numbers of trials assessing each strategy. This review aims to summarise the current evidence regarding potential strategies for managing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, noting how well the sexual dysfunction responds, as well as risks, such as adverse effects or worsening of the condition for which the antidepressant was initially prescribed. This should assist patients and their clinicians when deciding how best to manage these common problems.</P>
<P>Attention is drawn to the related Cochrane review on the management of sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotic drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Berner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">CCDAN's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR)</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at the editorial base (Bristol, UK), a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 29,500 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization's trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

The risk of bias tool assesses seven domains namely: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other issues&#8217;. Each domain is assigned one of the following judgements: &#8216;low risk&#8217; of bias, &#8216;high risk&#8217; of bias, or &#8216;unclear risk&#8217; of bias, and a supporting statement is provided to back up the judgement.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-04-08 11:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Data were analysed using Review Manager software (version 5.2). For binary efficacy outcomes, a pooled risk ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) was calculated using a fixed-effect model. Risk ratios are reported since this measure can be more readily applied in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1994</LINK>). For continuously distributed outcomes, the mean difference (MD) was calculated when the same scale was used by all studies. Standardised mean difference was employed for comparisons across different scales.</P>
<P>We extracted outcome data collected from any time point, but our reported analyses use trial endpoint data, except where specified. Differences between trials in the times of assessment are reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The total number of participants randomised in the 23 studies was 1886.</P>
<P>Participants in 12 of the studies had developed adverse sexual effects from the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Two participants in one study had received nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2002</LINK>). One study did not specify the type of antidepressant involved (<LINK REF="STD-Jespersen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jespersen 2004</LINK>).</P>

One study did not describe the gender of those participating (<LINK REF="STD-Masand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Masand 2001</LINK>), and the remaining studies recruited both men and women.</P>
<P>The participants in studies had wholly, or partially, recovered from the disorder for which antidepressants had been prescribed - most commonly depression (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Two studies reported inclusion of mood and anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2002</LINK>), and one study included participants treated for depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>). One study was restricted to people treated for panic disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Bernik-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernik 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>While most studies did not restrict inclusion to particular types of sexual dysfunction, one study employing sildenafil restricted inclusion to antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2006</LINK>), and another investigating bethanecol limited inclusion to ejaculatory delay or anorgasmia (<LINK REF="STD-Bernik-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernik 2004</LINK>).</P>

The range of doses taken once daily varied between 25 mg and 100 mg in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2006</LINK>), and a dose between 50 mg and 100mg was employed in the remaining four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nurnberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nurnberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nurnberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nurnberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nurnberg--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nurnberg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bupropion, which is thought to act by dual noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2004</LINK>), was investigated in five trials with a total of 579 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Masand 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Safarinejad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Safarinejad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Safarinejad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Safarinejad 2011</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-16 09:48:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 1886 people met the inclusion criteria for the updated review. The original version of this review included 15 studies with around 900 participants randomised, so there has been a substantial increase in the data available from randomised trials to address this area of interest. This update has included both increased data for previously identified strategies (addition of sildenafil or bupropion) and trials of new agents for this indication. All except one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2001</LINK>) assessed the addition of further medication to treat the sexual dysfunction.</P>
<P>We were unable to do the intended subgroup analyses by gender, but these are summarised descriptively here to facilitate interpretation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Men</HEADING>
<P>In men, data for the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (three studies, 255 participants; see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and tadalafil (one study, 54 participants) indicated that they led to a greater improvement in erectile function than placebo. The estimates of treatment effect observed are similar to those reported for their use in erectile dysfunction due to other causes (<LINK REF="REF-Fink-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In men, addition of higher dose bupropion has also shown benefit (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), but this is primarily shown in a single study (234 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Safarinejad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Safarinejad 2010</LINK>). Replication of this effect is likely to increase confidence in this finding. The magnitude of effect seen on total IIEF score (MD 20.10, 95% CI 17.14 to 23.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) was similar to that seen in studies of sildenafil (MD 19.36, 95% CI 15.00 to 23.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are also some promising data from a small cross-over trial of bethanecol suggesting benefit for men with antidepressant-induced ejaculatory delay or anorgasmia rather than erectile dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Bernik-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernik 2004</LINK>). Replication in further studies is likely to be necessary for clinicians and patients to have confidence in this effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Women</HEADING>
<P>For women it remains uncertain whether sildenafil is more effective than placebo, but outcome data are only available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nurnberg--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nurnberg 2008</LINK>). We have identified a larger unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Nurnberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nurnberg 2002</LINK>) - if results from this second study were to become available, it would be expected to reduce this uncertainty substantially.</P>
<P>Data from studies of bupropion 150 mg twice daily indicate a benefit over placebo. These included a study that predominantly included women (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2004</LINK>), and one solely in women (<LINK REF="STD-Safarinejad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Safarinejad 2011</LINK>). However, response rates in two studies of bupropion 150 mg once daily were consistent with superiority of either bupropion or placebo. The two-point improvement in CGI taken as a measure of response in <LINK REF="STD-Safarinejad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Safarinejad 2011</LINK> is equivalent to an improvement in rating from 'markedly' to 'mildly' impaired function, which may be a clinically significant change.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Both sexes</HEADING>
<P>Other augmentation strategies studied failed to show significant improvements in sexual dysfunction compared with placebo</P>
<P>One trial involving 75 participants of both genders with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed the effect of changing the antidepressant. Switching to nefazodone was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline, and was not associated with any worsening of depression. However, since nefazodone is no longer available for use, this strategy is now of limited usefulness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>We hypothesised that management strategies for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction might differ in acceptability or be associated with a worsening of the condition for which antidepressants were originally being taken. We have identified no data for any of the strategies assessed here that indicated they led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, the relatively small numbers assessed for many of the interventions studied means that the possibility of such an effect cannot confidently be excluded in all cases.</P>
<P>Rates of dropout from studies with different treatments were not clearly presented in all cases. From the available data, only one intervention was associated with an increase in people dropping out of the study, which was augmentation with mirtazapine (<LINK REF="STD-Michelson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michelson 2002</LINK>). However, the analysis of this four-arm study does not correct for the multiple statistical comparisons that result, and therefore the 95% confidence intervals presented may overestimate the confidence with which this effect has been shown. Further randomised trial data may act to reduce this uncertainty.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-04-15 20:11:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The available data mostly investigate the strategy of adding additional medication to counteract antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. There is an absence of randomised data that assesses switching to currently-available antidepressant agents with lower rates of sexual adverse effects, the role of psychological or mechanical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 1995</LINK>), or of techniques such as drug holidays. There is a particular need for more evidence to guide treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women. The ongoing studies identified suggest that this limitation of the evidence-base will be only partially be addressed in the foreseeable future. Of the six studies identified, only one is investigating change of antidepressant (<LINK REF="STD-Takeda-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Takeda 2011</LINK>), and only one other is investigating <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>, sex therapy, and a combination of the two (<LINK REF="STD-Meston-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meston 2008</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-04-09 10:32:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 1886 people were included in this review. Many studies were unclear in their reporting of methods, which leaves uncertainty regarding the extent to which their results are subject to bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Use of a double-blind design was commonly reported, but there was generally little information provided on methods used for randomisation or to maintain concealment of allocation. Studies may have been vulnerable to reporting bias, since original study protocols were not available, and, in some cases, only data from particular subscales or questions within a larger scale were reported.</P>
<P>There is now a strong and internally consistent evidence base for the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors for antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction in men. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far, however, unexplained inconsistencies in effects between studies remain, reducing the confidence with which this strategy can be advocated.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-04-09 10:32:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>While we have made efforts to be comprehensive in our methods to identify all published studies, given the small numbers of studies that investigated most of the strategies assessed, the presence of any unpublished trials could have substantial effects on estimates of effect. In some cases, only results from particular items or subscales within ratings scales are available. It is likely that this could act to bias estimates of effect obtained, increasing apparent effectiveness.</P>
<P>The investigation of multiple strategies and often multiple outcomes for each strategy within this review will have increased the risk of reporting false positive findings of effectiveness.</P>

We are not aware of any non-Cochrane systematic reviews on this topic.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-04-09 10:34:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence currently available is rather limited. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil or tadalafil appears to be an effective strategy, and there are some promising data for bupropion. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-15 15:28:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Further randomised trials are required. There is a particular need for more evidence to guide treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women. Addition of bupropion to existing treatment warrants further study. Randomised trials could assess approaches for which there is currently an absence of evidence, including: switching to currently-available antidepressant agents with lower rates of sexual adverse effects, the role of psychological or mechanical interventions, or of techniques such as drug holidays. Outcome assessments using standardised ratings scales should be included.</P>
