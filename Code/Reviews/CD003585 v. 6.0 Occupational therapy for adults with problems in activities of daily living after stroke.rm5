<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We changed the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section, to add further explanation of how the intervention might work.</P>
<P>We included one new trial with 10 participants. We need further information on five trials to assess eligibility. Two trials are ongoing. The review now has 9 included studies, involving 994 participants. We excluded any trials that tested interventions delivered to people with stroke living in long-term care. Therefore, we excluded one previously included study (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We improved the search strategies and history. We did not handsearch journals. We extended our search of trial registers.</P>
<P>Previously, we had included each intervention arm as a combined dataset compared to the control group. In this 2017 update, we selected the intervention that most closely related to our intended intervention. Therefore, we excluded data from leisure promotion intervention arms from two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Drummond-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Drummond 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>We incorporated Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias into this update. We revisited the critical appraisal of all studies included in previous versions of both reviews updating all assessments of risk of bias.</P>
<P>We incorporated 'risk of bias' assessments in analyses by restricting the primary analysis to studies at low and unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>What are the effects of occupational therapy for adults with stroke on activities of daily living?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Different parts of the brain carry out different functions: seeing, sensation, balance, movement, understanding language, behaviour, problem solving, and emotion. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. If the blood supply is cut off to a part of the brain that carries out a particular function (such as seeing, moving arms and legs, or speaking), then these body parts or body functions will not work as they should.</P>
<P>Activities of daily living (ADLs) are daily household-based activities that people carry out to maintain health and well-being. ADLs include eating and drinking, moving about, going to the toilet, personal hygiene, dressing and undressing, and grooming. When stroke changes how body parts or functions work, then the ability to carry out ADLs can become affected.</P>
<P>For adults with stroke, the goal of occupational therapy is to improve ability to carry out ADLs. Strategies used by occupational therapists include activity-based interventions, adaptive techniques, assistive technology, and environmental adaptations.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We found nine studies up to January 2017, involving 994 participants, that looked at the benefits of occupational therapy interventions for adults with stroke who had problems with activities of daily living. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.</P>
<P>
<B>Key result</B>
<BR/>We found that occupational therapy for people with stroke can improve their ability to carry out these daily activities and stop them deteriorating in those abilities. We found no evidence that occupational therapy reduced rates of death or the need to be cared for in an institution, or affected mood or distress of the participant. We did not collect data on carer-related outcomes or participant satisfaction with the service.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>There were few studies measuring our outcomes of interest and we judged the quality of the evidence to be of low-quality. Many of the studies did not report methods sufficiently clearly and it was not possible to mask the occupational therapy from the person giving or receiving the treatment; this could also have influenced the results in our studies. We did not have sufficient good-quality evidence to be certain of our results and we cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Activities of daily living (ADL) are daily home-based activities that people carry out to maintain health and well-being. ADLs include the ability to: eat and drink unassisted, move, go to the toilet, carry out personal hygiene tasks, dress unassisted, and groom. Stroke causes impairment-related functional limitations that may result in difficulties participating in ADLs independent of supervision, direction, or physical assistance.</P>
<P>For adults with stroke, the goal of occupational therapy is to improve their ability to carry out activities of daily living.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-07-18 10:27:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of occupational therapy interventions on the functional ability of adults with stroke in the domain of activities of daily living, compared with no intervention or standard care/practice.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:35:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 30 January 2017), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, January 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 5 January 2017), Embase (1974 to 5 January 2017), CINAHL (1937 to January 2017), PsycINFO (1806 to 2 November 2016), AMED (1985 to 1 November 2016), and Web of Science (1900 to 6 January 2017). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-18 10:27:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified randomised controlled trials of an occupational therapy intervention (compared with no intervention or standard care/practice) where people with stroke practiced activities of daily living, or where performance in activities of daily living was the focus of the occupational therapy intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:35:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data for prespecified outcomes. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who had deteriorated or were dependent in personal activities of daily living and performance in activities of daily living at the end of follow-up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 10:30:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included nine studies with 994 participants in this update. Occupational therapy targeted towards activities of daily living after stroke increased performance scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.31, P = 0.02; 7 studies; 749 participants; low-quality evidence) and reduced the risk of poor outcome (death, deterioration or dependency in personal activities of daily living) (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96; P = 0.03; 5 studies; 771 participants; low-quality evidence). We also found that those who received occupational therapy were more independent in extended activities of daily living (OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.37); P = 0.005; 5 studies; 665 participants; low-quality evidence). Occupational therapy did not influence mortality (OR: 1.02 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.61); P = 0.93; 8 studies; 950 participants), or reduce the combined odds of death and institutionalisation (OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.32); P = 0.55; 4 studies; 671 participants), or death and dependency (OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.23); P = 0.47; 4 trials; 659 participants). Occupational therapy did not improve mood or distress scores (OR 0.08 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.26); P = 0.35; 4 studies; 519 participants; low-quality evidence). There were insufficient data to determine the effects of occupational therapy on health-related quality of life. We found no studies of consenting carers prior to study participation and therefore there were no carer-related outcomes in our review. There were insufficient data to determine participants' and carers' satisfaction with services.</P>
<P>Using GRADE, the quality of evidence was low. The major limitation was the number of studies at unclear risk of selection bias and an inevitable high risk of performance and detection bias, as both participants and occupational therapists could not be blinded to the intervention. In addition, there was a sparseness of data for our outcomes of interest and we downgraded the quality of our evidence for these reasons.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:35:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found low-quality evidence that occupational therapy targeted towards activities of daily living after stroke can improve performance in activities of daily living and reduce the risk of deterioration in these abilities. Because the included studies had methodological flaws, this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect of occupational therapy for adults with stroke.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-12 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is the death of brain tissue as a result of an interruption of the blood flow leading to or within the brain, or by an aneurysm or ruptured blood vessel in the brain. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are normal day-to-day household-based tasks and activities that people carry out to maintain health and well-being. ADLs include eating and drinking, moving about (such as getting into and out of bed, turning over in bed, getting on and off a chair, moving between rooms, moving between levels (using stairs)), going to the toilet (including carrying out toilet hygiene), carrying out personal hygiene tasks (including washing hair and body, and drying oneself), getting dressed and undressed, and grooming activities (including performing oral hygiene activities, combing hair, shaving). Stroke causes impairment-related functional limitations that may result in difficulties carrying out ADLs independent of supervision, direction, or physical assistance.<BR/>

<P>The central aspects (or core components) of occupational therapy for adults with stroke include the following.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment</HEADING>
<P>Assessment allows occupational therapists to gather important information about the adult with stroke and the difficulties they are facing. The purpose of assessment is to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>determine the impact of stroke-related changes in body structures and body functions on the adult's skills, capacities, and abilities to independently initiate, sustain, and complete actions and tasks necessary to carry out activities of daily living (i.e. stroke-related impairment-related functional limitations) (<LINK REF="REF-Gillen-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillen 2016a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICF 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>identify the adult with stroke's perceived problems and priorities and to prioritise main concerns.</LI>
<LI>learn about stroke-related impairment-related functional limitations by observing the adult with stroke carrying out meaningful tasks, such as getting dressed or eating (<LINK REF="REF-Gillen-2016e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillen 2016e</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008e" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008e</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>All assessments are used to analyse how the adult with stroke completes activities of daily living, the results of which are used to create a therapy plan.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Partnership</HEADING>
<P>Occupational therapists work in partnership with adults with stroke and make joint decisions about what therapeutic interventions and individual goals are appropriate and relevant (<LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008c</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Programme plan</HEADING>
<P>There is a programme plan for each adult with stroke and this plan includes all activities necessary to achieve clinical recovery and performance improvement for that given individual (<LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008c</LINK>).</P>
<P>The programme plan includes detailed specifications of individual short-term and long-term goals, and treatment approaches and methods to be employed to achieve the goals. The nature and definition of individual goals is a shared decision between the adult with stroke and occupational therapist and is based on the self-determined needs and preferences of the adult with stroke combined with the best available information from assessments, current best scientific information, and clinical judgement (<LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Occupational therapy treatment approaches and methods are selected based on intentionality, appropriateness, and resources available (<LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008b</LINK>). Short-term and long-term goals are the stages into which the programme is divided for monitoring, and evaluation and measurement of the impact of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008c</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Activities of daily living as a therapeutic medium and goal</HEADING>
<P>Occupational therapists use activities of daily living as a means to achieve therapeutic change (improvement in capacities and abilities) and as the goal of therapy (i.e. to achieve improvements in activities and participation) (<LINK REF="REF-ICF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICF 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OTfPD-2008d" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTfPD 2008d</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-18 13:39:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As mortality rates from stroke continue to improve, so do the odds that several generations of stroke survivors are alive at the same time. Many stroke survivors have marked limitations in ability to perform routine ADLs as a result of stroke-related physical or mental impairment. As a consequence, many stroke survivors require some form of long-term care, which includes unpaid care (provided by family and friends), government or funded personal care services, assisted living, and residential or nursing care. The significant costs associated with providing this support is likely to be borne by families and society.</P>
<P>Occupational therapy aims to help people reach and maintain their maximum level of function and self-reliance in ADL.</P>
<P>The original Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Legg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legg 2006</LINK>), including eight studies involving 1258 participants, found that occupational therapy interventions reduced the odds of a poor outcome (dependency or deterioration) and increased personal ADL scores. This is an update of the original review. A GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach was not used to assess the quality of the evidence in the original review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:37:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). We assessed the methods used in each study to control for the following potential sources of bias: sequence generation (selection bias); allocation concealment (selection bias); blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (performance and detection bias); incomplete outcome data (attrition bias); selective outcome reporting (reporting bias); and other sources of bias.</P>
<P>It was not feasible to blind participants and personnel to the intervention and therefore we agreed to judge all outcomes as having a high risk of performance bias. For detection bias, we considered this by outcome. We judged that all outcomes relating to death were unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding of outcome assessors and, even if outcome assessors for death were described as not blinded, we judged this bias to be low risk. For detection bias relating to all other outcomes, we considered three aspects from the information presented in the paper: whether the tool that was used to assess the outcome used observation, interview or self-completion (e.g. questionnaire); whether the assessment was made by the participant or an assessor; and whether the assessor was blinded. If the assessment tool involved self-assessment by the participant, we judged detection bias to be unclear because the participant could not be blinded to the intervention and we did not know if lack of blinding would influence participant responses to self-assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). If the assessment tool was used by an independent assessor and only included observation, we judged detection bias to be low. Where assessment was mixed either by type of assessor, type of tool, or type of outcome, we judged detection bias to be unclear.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, a true intention-to-treat analysis was defined as following three principles: 1) participants were kept in the intervention groups to which they were randomised, regardless of the intervention they actually received; 2) there was measured outcome data on all participants; and 3) all randomised participants were included in the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). We made judgements on attrition bias from these three criteria.</P>
<P>For reporting bias, we attempted to source prospective registration reports through information presented in study reports or from sifting of clinical trial register searches. We intended to judge bias by comparing prospective registration reports or protocols with outcomes reported in the full report.</P>

<P>We collected binary data for our outcomes related to death and analysed these using the Peto odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We collected continuous data reported as means (with standard deviations) for outcomes relating to activities of daily living, extended activities of daily living, health-related quality of life (participant and carers), mood and distress scores (participant and carers). We calculated the standardised mean difference from continuous data using inverse variance, to account for differences in the assessment tools used to measure the same outcome.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visually examining forest plots, and by performing the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test using a P value of less than 0.1 to indicate statistically significant heterogeneity. We used a P value of less than 0.1 rather than the conventional cut-off point of 0.05 because of the low power of this test. We quantified the effect of heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic including its 95% CI. We used the following cut-offs as a guide to interpretation: I<SUP>2</SUP> at 0% to 40% was not considered important, 30% to 60% suggested moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% suggested substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% was considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>).</P>

<P>We completed meta-analysis of outcomes for which we had comparable effect measures from more than one study, and when measures of heterogeneity indicated that pooling of results was appropriate.

<P>We limited the primary analysis to studies with an overall low or unclear risk of bias. We reached decisions on overall risk of bias per study by consideration of four risk of bias domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data. We required a study to have a judgment of low risk of bias in all four domains in order to categorise it as having an overall low risk of bias. We categorised a study that had both low and unclear judgements to have an overall unclear risk of bias. We did not include studies with high risk of bias judgements in these four domains in any of our primary analyses; we reconsidered this decision in sensitivity analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">GRADE and 'Summary of findings'</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for our outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach, as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011d</LINK>). The quality of the evidence for a specific outcome is based on the performance of the studies against five criteria: study design and limitations, directness of evidence, consistency of results, precision (sufficient data), and reporting of results across all studies that measure a specific outcome. This approach yields an overall measure of how confident we can be that our estimate of effect is correct (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). We used the principles of the GRADE system to prepare an overall assessment of evidence related to each of the following outcomes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Performance in activities of daily living.</LI>
<LI>Death or 'poor outcome' (deterioration or dependency).</LI>
<LI>Extended activities of daily living.</LI>
<LI>Mood or distress</LI>
</OL>
<P>We (LL and SL) independently used GRADEpro software (<A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/</A>) to create a 'Summary of findings&#8217; table for each comparison. We reached consensus and resolved disagreements by consulting a third review author, if required.</P>
<P>Study design and limitations refers to the results of the 'risk of bias' assessment (<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). Directness of evidence refers to the comparability of population, interventions, and outcomes of interest in the included studies. We described any concerns regarding comparability of the included studies. Consistency of results refers to similarity in treatment effect in results across the included studies and includes the direction and size of effect and statistical significance. We considered overlap of confidence intervals to indicate statistical homogeneity. We also used the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of significance for heterogeneity using a P value of less than 0.10 to indicate statistical significance and used I<SUP>2 </SUP>as an index of heterogeneity. Precision refers to the effect of study size on the precision of the estimate of treatment effect. For each outcome, we noted the sample size and magnitude and direction of the experimental intervention's effect compared with the control intervention - specifically the width of the confidence interval surrounding the estimate i.e. whether the width was narrow indicating more precision) or wider (indicating more uncertainty) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011d</LINK>). Publication bias refers to the likelihood of selective publication of studies or outcomes. Had there been a sufficient number of studies we would have assessed probability of selective outcome reporting as part of the assessment of risk of bias using funnel plots as visual tools for examining publication and other bias (i.e. small study effects).</P>

One study used the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Parker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2001</LINK>), and four studies used a clinical definition of stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Corr-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Corr 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbertson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbertson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Logan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Logan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1999</LINK>). Remaining studies did not specify a definition of stroke.

One study used a blinded outcome assessor to collect FIM data directly from the participant through telephone interview (<LINK REF="STD-Radomski-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Radomski 2007</LINK>).

<P>If we assumed that the participants who were missing from the intervention groups (40/425 (9.4%)) and control groups (47/432 (10.9%) were alive and well and living at home, then the odds of a poor outcome was still reduced for those participants receiving occupational therapy interventions (OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.00); P = 0.05) with no statistically significant heterogeneity (Chi = 3.36, df = 4 (P = 0.50); I = 0%). Alternatively, when we considered participants who were missing from the intervention groups and control groups to be either dead or having a poor outcome (deterioration or dependency), then the odds of a poor outcome was still reduced for those participants receiving occupational therapy interventions (OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.99); P = 0.04) with no statistically significant heterogeneity (Chi = 3.06, df = 4 (P = 0.55); I = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 14:17:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we included nine studies with 994 participants.</P>
<P>We found that occupational therapy delivered to adults after stroke and targeted towards activities of daily living increased ADL scores and reduced the risk of poor outcome (the combined odds of death and deterioration or dependency in activities of daily living). We also found that those who received occupational therapy were more independent in extended activities of daily living. Occupational therapy did not influence mortality or reduce the combined odds of death and dependency, death and deterioration or death and institutionalisation; however, data were incomplete and only available for a few studies. Occupational therapy did not improve mood or distress scores. There were insufficient data to determine the effects of occupational therapy on health-related quality of life. We found no studies of consenting unpaid carers prior to study participation and therefore there were no carer-related outcomes in our review. There were insufficient data to determine participants' and carers' satisfaction with services.</P>
<P>We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of our evidence for the outcomes: personal activities of daily living, death or a poor outcome, or extended activities of daily living. We judged the evidence to be low-quality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 14:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a thorough search, including searches of grey literature and clinical trial registers. Included studies all compared an occupational therapy intervention with no intervention or standard care/practice, and included participants who were adults with stroke. We excluded studies that used occupational therapy as part of multidisciplinary approach, although therapy may typically be received as part of a multidisciplinary process. Studies were published from 1995 to 2017, with seven studies based in the UK, one in the US, and one in Hong Kong. All studies were directly applicable to our review objective.</P>
<P>Whilst the studies were all appropriate, we identified few trials with few participants and we considered that such limited data led to imprecision in the effect estimates for our primary outcomes and the effect on extended activities of daily living. We used GRADEpro to downgrade the quality of our evidence due to this imprecision.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-12 09:46:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study methodology. Reporting methods used by study authors were often incomplete. Only three of the nine studies described both a suitable method of randomisation and method of allocation concealment. There was inevitable high risk of performance bias in all studies as personnel and participants could not be blinded to their group allocation. We did not consider that lack of blinding of outcome assessors for outcomes relating to death would influence assessment. However, we gave careful consideration to the assessment of all other outcomes: we considered the variety of assessment tools, including observation, participant self-assessment, completion of questionnaires and telephone interviews, used by outcome assessors. Whilst some study authors reported that outcomes assessors were independent, we were not able to judge whether any of the studies were at a low or high risk of detection bias because of the methods used to assess outcomes and the lack of blinding of participants. Although some study authors reported loss of participants, this was balanced between groups and we judged most studies to have a low risk of attrition bias. No included studies provided details of prospective trial registration and we could not judge risk of selective outcome reporting bias.</P>
<P>We used GRADEpro to downgrade the quality of our evidence due to study limitations.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-18 13:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted the review using robust Cochrane methodology, with two review authors independently assessing studies for eligibility, extracting data, and carrying out 'risk of bias' assessment.</P>
<P>We made some changes to the review during this update. We altered the inclusion criteria so that studies that were carried out in nursing homes were no longer eligible; this removed one previously included study which is included in another Cochrane review. We reviewed the decision to include data from carers who had not consented to participate; we did not conduct any analysis on any carer-related outcomes. We reviewed the decision to combine data in multi-arm studies; we only used data from the intervention arm that was closest to the review objectives but we no longer had available data for one study. We reviewed the decision to include all studies in meta-analysis; we only included studies that had an overall low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>We made these changes to the review in order to increase the robustness of our evidence. We assessed the decision regarding inclusion of only studies with low or unclear risk of bias in sensitivity analysis and results were not changed. Comparing the effect estimates in the 2017 update with those in the original review do not suggest that our decisions have introduced bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:39:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found one systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Reinsperger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinsperger 2012</LINK>, published in German, that had reported the methods and results of the original occupational therapy review (<LINK REF="REF-Legg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legg 2006</LINK>) and provided an update of the original review. The review authors searched for and included new studies. The studies identified by <LINK REF="REF-Reinsperger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinsperger 2012</LINK> did not meet our review inclusion criteria. Further, the authors failed to identify many of the studies that were potential studies for inclusion. The authors concluded that occupational therapy led to an improvement in outcomes for adults after stroke; this review did not include an assessment of quality of the evidence using GRADE.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 14:06:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 11:46:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Occupational therapy does appear to improve performance in activities of daily living and reduce the odds of deterioration in those abilities. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low and as such our confidence in the effect estimates is limited and the true effect may be substantially different from our estimates. Further evidence as to the clinical and cost effectiveness of occupational therapy interventions after stroke is required as, due to the quality of evidence, the current data support the provision of occupational therapy but the confidence in this is limited and could be overturned by further trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-18 14:06:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of studies included in this review test the effects of a single occupational therapist working with adults with stroke to improve ADL; these trial therapists may or may not be representative of the broader occupational therapy workforce. Good quality, large, multiple therapist, no intervention or standard care/practice comparator randomised controlled studies are required to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of occupational therapy after stroke. Occupational therapists operate in hospital-based specialist stroke services, in non-specialist setting serving stroke patients and in community settings and therefore studies should be conducted across a range of sites with the results stratified and interpreted by site. Studies, with clearly reported methods, should be focused on areas where occupational therapy may deliver significant clinical benefits through improved performance in ADL, or cost effectiveness benefits through faster rehabilitation and discharge.</P>
