<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-15 13:19:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although acupuncture or Traditional Chinese Medicine has been practised for over 2000 years in China and the Far East, especially in Korea and Japan, it is a relatively new form of treament for physical and psychological conditions in the West. Acupuncture inserts needles into the skin to stimulate specific points of the body (acupoints). The aim is to achieve balance and harmony of the body.</P>
<P>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness and is usually treated using antipsychotic medication. However, although effective, antipsychotic medication can cause side-effects (such as sleepiness, weight gain and even dribbling). Acupuncture has been shown to have very few negative effects on the individual and could be more socially acceptable and tolerable for people with mental health problems. Acupuncture may also be less expensive than drugs made by pharmaceutical companies, so reducing costs to individuals and health services.</P>
<P>This reviews looks at the effectiveness of various types of acupuncture as treatment for people with schizophrenia. An update search for studies was carried out in 2012 and found 30 studies that randomised participants who were receiving antipsychotic medication to receive additional acupuncture or standard care.</P>
<P>Although some of the studies did favour acupuncture when combined with antipsychotics, the information available was small scale and rated to be very low or low quality by the review authors, so not completely provable and valid. Depression was reduced when combining acupuncture with antipsychotic medication, but again this finding came from small-scale research, so cannot be clearly shown to be true. The review concludes that people with mental health problems, policy makers and health professionals need much better evidence in order to establish if there are any potential benefits to acupuncture.</P>
<P>This means that the question of whether acupuncture is of benefit to people, and whether it is of greater benefit than antipsychotic medication, remains unanswered. There is not enough information to establish that acupuncture is of benefit or harm to people with mental health problems.</P>

<P>Acupuncture, with many categories such as traditional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, and acupoint injection, has been shown to be relatively safe with few adverse effects. It is accessible and inexpensive, at least in China, and is likely to be widely used there for psychotic symptoms.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-01-17 10:03:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the effects of acupuncture, alone or in combination treatments compared with placebo (or no treatment) or any other treatments for people with schizophrenia or related psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group&#8217;s Trials Register (February 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries. We also inspected references of identified studies and contacted relevant authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-08 09:24:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia-like illnesses, comparing acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics alone, acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics, acupuncture with antipsychotics, acupuncture added to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drug with TCM drug, acupuncture with TCM drug, electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reliably extracted data from all included studies, discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and contacted authors of studies when necessary. We analysed binary outcomes using a standard estimation of risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences with 95% CI. For homogeneous data we used fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After an update search in 2012 the review now includes 30 studies testing different forms of acupuncture across six different comparisons. All studies were at moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>When acupuncture plus standard antipsychotic treatment was compared with standard antipsychotic treatment alone, people were at less risk of being 'not improved' (n = 244, 3 RCTs, medium-term RR 0.40 CI 0.28 to 0.57, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Mental state findings were mostly consistent with this finding as was time in hospital (n = 120, 1 RCT, days MD -16.00 CI -19.54 to -12.46, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). If anything, adverse effects were less for the acupuncture group (e.g. central nervous system, insomnia, short-term, n = 202, 3 RCTs, RR 0.30 CI 0.11 to 0.83, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>When acupuncture was added to low dose antipsychotics and this was compared with standard dose antipsychotic drugs, relapse was less in the experimental group (n = 170, 1 RCT, long-term RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.89, <I>very low quality evidence</I>) but there was no difference for the outcome of 'not improved'. Again, mental state findings were mostly consistent with the latter. Incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms - akathisia, were less for those in the acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics group (n = 180, 1 RCT, short-term RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.49, <I>low quality evidence</I>) - as dry mouth, blurred vision and tachycardia.</P>
<P>When acupuncture was compared with antipsychotic drugs of known efficacy in standard doses, there were equivocal data for outcomes such as 'not improved' using different global state criteria. Traditional acupuncture added to TCM drug had benefit over use of TCM drug alone (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR no clinically important change 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.59, <I>low quality evidence</I>), but when traditional acupuncture was compared with TCM drug directly there was no significant difference in the short-term. However, we found that participants given electroacupuncture were significantly less likely to experience a worsening in global state (n = 88, 1 RCT, short-term RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In the one study that compared electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy there were significantly different rates of spinal fracture between the groups (n = 68, 1 RCT, short-term RR 0.33 CI 0.14 to 0.81, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Attrition in all studies was minimal. No studies reported death, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, or economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-10 03:40:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture may have some antipsychotic effects as measured on global and mental state with few adverse effects. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of acupuncture for people with schizophrenia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia affects 1% of people and therefore, one fifth of people with schizophrenia are of Chinese origin. In Chinese health care, theories for the aetiology, pathology and treatment of schizophrenia are different to those of Western medicine. Conventional medicine diagnoses schizophrenia primarily by operationalised criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10). Chinese medicine uses different methodology to diagnose mental health disorders such as schizophrenia by pattern differentiation. The four diagnostic methods (inspection, listening/smelling, inquiry and palpation) are the way by which patient information is obtained (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1991</LINK>). This information is then analysed using one or several diagnostic models (Zang Fu theory, Eight Principles [yin/yang, interior/exterior, excess/deficiency, hot/cold], Four Division Pattern [Wei Qi Ying Xue ], Six Division Pattern, Five Elements Pattern [wood, fire, earth, metal, and water], Pattern of Qi, Blood, and Body Fluids, Three Burners Pattern) to arrive at a diagnosis. Thus, two people diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia could nevertheless, from a Chinese medicine perspective, have different sub-types or patterns and therefore require different treatment. The Psychosis Professional Committee of Chinese Integrative Medicine Association drafted the Standard of Integrative Medicine Syndrome Type of Schizophrenia. There are six main patterns which fall within the disease category of Dian Kuang/withdrawal mania which can also encompass schizophrenia. The six types are: 1. Internal disturbance of pyrophlegm; 2. Internal retention of phlegm and dampness; 3. Qi stagnation and blood stasis; 4. Yin deficiency and fire excess; 5. Yang deficiency; 6.Other miscellaneous types (<LINK REF="REF-The-Psychosis-Professional-Committee-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Psychosis Professional Committee 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1996</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The illness often causes distortions of perception, thinking, behaving and even movement and, although antipsychotic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia since the early 1950s, these treatments still leave many with residual symptoms and disabling adverse effects. Acupuncture (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) has been shown to have few adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2001</LINK>) and may be more socially acceptable, tolerable and inexpensive than the more conventional drugs available from the pharmaceutical industry. Chinese medicine, which includes acupuncture and is also referred to as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used to treat 'schizophrenia-like illnesses' (i.e. Dian Kuang/withdrawal mania) for over 2000 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ming-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ming 2001</LINK>). Acupuncture is practiced as an accepted healthcare model in China, Korea and Japan, although the methods used in each country are distinct (<LINK REF="REF-Kaptchuk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaptchuk 2002</LINK>). There are many categories of acupuncture such as traditional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, and acupoint injection.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-18 09:20:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acupuncture involves the stimulation of specific points (acupoints). The internal diseases are treated using external applications by dredging meridians, regulating Yin and Yang, reinforcing the healthy Qi and eliminating the pathogenic factors. Though acupuncture has a long history, any mechanism for treating schizophrenia is still unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2010</LINK>). Acupuncture may affect the central nervous functions of the cerebral cortex through recuperating the Qi, blood, dredging meridians and then adjusting the nervous system's functions and endocrine level (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2007</LINK>). There is, however, not enough modern neural physiological and biochemical research, imaging or animal studies to support this (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-28 15:10:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acupuncture has been used to treat schizophrenia for many years and now it is considered as one of the most popular types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Western health care. We wish to update past work, undertake a review that is systematic and quantify the effects of this inexpensive treatment.</P>

<P>For this 2012 update, XS extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, JX independently extracted data from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. We discussed disagreements, documented our decisions and, if necessary, contracted authors of studies for clarification. With any remaining problems, CEA helped clarify issues, although he could not translate the Mandarin text. When uncertainty persisted, we allocated the trial to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>. Data presented only in graphs and figures were extracted whenever possible, but included only if two review authors independently extracted the same results. In order to obtain missing information or for clarification, whenever necessary we contacted authors through an open-ended request .

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we have noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
<P>Previous version of this review did not combine endpoint and change data in the analysis (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:<BR/>a) standard deviations (SDs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;<BR/>b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1301151509010033757225938656556&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Altman-1996">Altman 1996</A>);<BR/>c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1301151509010033757225938656556&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Kay-1986">Kay 1986</A>)), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large (&gt;200) and we will enter these into the syntheses. We presented skewed endpoint data from studies of less than 200 participants as 'Other data' in the Data &amp; analyses rather than enter such data in analyses.<BR/>
<BR/>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We planned to present and enter change data into analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2012 update, XS worked independently by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This new set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. JX assessed risk of bias from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total.</P>
<P>Any disagreements between raters were resolved through discussion with CEA. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. All disagreements in quality assessment were recorded and reported. If disputes arose as to which quality category a trial was to be rated, again, we resolved these through discussion.</P>
<P>We have noted the level of risk of bias in both the text of the review and in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/H) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster trials where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies had been included, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We would have contacted the first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC had not been reported, it would have been assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, if we had identified any cross-over trials, we would only have used data from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we would have presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary we would simply add these and combine within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, if for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses, (except for the outcome 'leaving the study early'). If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would mark such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - was used for those who did not. If the above assumptions had been used for the primary outcomes we would have undertaken a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>When standard deviations were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. When not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals are available for group means, and either a P value or T value available for differences in mean, we could calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we can calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. If possible, we planned to examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, if LOCF data had been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we would have reproduced these data and indicated that they were the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects.

In other cases, where funnel plots are possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. we only used random-effects model when heterogeneity was present.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Allocation</HEADING>
<P>All included studies were randomised controlled trials. Only 10 of the included studies described the randomisation method. Three studies used a random sampling method (<LINK REF="STD-acupoint-cat-_x002d_-Sun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">acupoint cat - Sun 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Chen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Chen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK>); three were randomised by using a random allocation table (<LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Liu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Liu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Wang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Xu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Xu 2004</LINK>); two drew lots (<LINK REF="STD-acupoint-inj-_x002d_-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">acupoint inj - Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Yao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Yao 2006</LINK>); one study used the SAS program - this was the only trial that described allocation concealment by using opaque sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Cheng-2009" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Cheng 2009</LINK>) and one used the coin-tossing method (<LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Cui-2000" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Cui 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>We found six categories of acupuncture were used whether alone or in combination regimens: traditional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupoint injection, laser acupuncture, acupoint catgut treatment and electric acupuncture convulsive therapy. Traditional acupuncture included acupuncture manipulation and moxibustion. Acupuncture manipulation refers to an operation method to prevent disease by using different needles or non-needle way to stimulate the specific points (acupoints) with certain practices or methods. Moxibustion not only refers to burning, smoking and ironing body surface mainly using moxa but also refers to any external treatment of non-fire source (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2007</LINK>). Electroacupuncture refers to a combination method of needles and electrical stimulation to prevent disease that connects needles with trace current which are close to the human bio-electricity after inserting needles into acupoints and getting the feeling of 'DeQi' (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2007</LINK>). Acupoint injection, guiding by the basic theory of Chinese medicine, is a treatment method with synergistic effects of acupuncture manipulation and drugs, which is to inject drugs into relative acupoint or special point (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2010</LINK>). Laser acupuncture, guiding by the basic theory of Chinese medicine, is a treatment method of preventing disease, treating disease, and health care to stimulate acupoints effectively using low-intensity laser beam to irradiate acupoints directly, focus on acupoints or with beam expander (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2010</LINK>). Acupoint catgut treatment, guiding by the basic theory of Chinese medicine, is an external treatment method of treating diseases with catgut's stimulation effects on acupoints by using different types of catgut to embed acupoints selectively (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 2012</LINK>). Electric acupuncture convulsive therapy, deriving from acupuncture, is a treatment method for mental disorders by using subconvulsive stimulating currents and with the electrodes in acupoints (Baihui and Renzhong) (<LINK REF="STD-Xue-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1985</LINK>).</P>

<P>8.2.2.5 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HAMD (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1967</LINK>)<BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of the depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five-point or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. A score of 11 is generally regarded as indicative of a diagnosis of mild depression, 14 to 17 mild to moderate depression and &gt;17 moderate to severe depression. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Chen 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> reported data of this scale.</P>

The questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and items are framed in terms of positive and negative statements. It can be effectively used in a variety of settings, including primary care, psychiatric clinics, drug trials and various research situations. Each item is scored on a Likert scale ranging from one to four. Most people with depression score between 50 and 69, while a score of 70 and above indicates severe depression. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> reported SDS data.</P>

The scales consist of two subscales - the auditory hallucinations subscale (AH) and delusions subscale (DS). The auditory hallucinations subscale is an 11-item scale. The dimensions of auditory hallucinations are frequency, duration, location, loudness, beliefs re-origin of voices, amount of negative content of voices, degree of negative content, amount of distress, intensity of distress, disruption to life caused by voices, controllability of voices. The total AH score ranges from zero to 44. The delusions subscale is a six-item scale.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main results are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables. Thirty studies were included and all findings are, at the very least, at moderate risk of bias. Ten trials describe the randomisation method but only one allocation concealment (by envelopes). Eight studies used a blinding method. Most studies were short-term and only two followed up participants to beyond six months. All but one study was undertaken in China.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Diagnosis and assessment criteria</HEADING>
<P>Operational criteria (CCMD, ICD-10, DSM) were used in most studies although three trials did not report criteria. The recent version of the CCMD is CCMD-3. Whilst this refers to ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, it contains locally salient features that are absent in the international systems (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2002</LINK>). Many Chinese psychiatrists consider that this system has advantages with its inclusion of culture-distinctive categories and the exclusion of irrelevant Western diagnostic categories (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2001</LINK>). The differences between local and global psychiatric classifications causes some questions about diagnosis and assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2009</LINK>). We are reasonably confident, however, that those entering these trials would be widely recognised as suffering from schizophrenia and even if 10% of diagnoses were inaccurate, this may reflect the real world more closely than if all diagnoses were entirely accurate.</P>
<P>We found that different criteria for outcomes of dichotomous data from global state and mental state made it difficult to merge data and analyse. We do think there is a strong argument for rationalising outcome measures (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org/">COMET</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Different treatments and controls</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Acupuncture methods</HEADING>
<P>With the development of acupuncture and modern medical technology, there are many categories of acupuncture. In this update review we found six acupuncture categories - traditional acupuncture (nine studies), electroacupuncture (12 studies), acupoint injection (three studies), laser acupuncture (three studies), acupoint catgut treatment (two studies) and another special category electric acupuncture convulsive therapy (one study). The mechanisms of action of any of these techniques still could not be explained. Even with the same category of acupuncture there are various choices for acupoints, frequencies and durations (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). It remains impossible to pre-judge clinical or physiological heterogeneity - or homogeneity - of different categories of acupuncture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Placebo methods</HEADING>
<P>In this update we found <LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Bouhlel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Bouhlel 2011</LINK> used sham traditional acupuncture, <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Cheng-2009" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Cheng 2009</LINK> used sham electroacupuncture, <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Liu-1986" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Liu 1986</LINK> used sham laser irradiation and <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> sham laser acupuncture. Placebo methods may reduce participants' subjectivity but it is difficult to use, especially in China where many have previous experience of acupuncture and may well know the difference between real and pseudo-acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. COMPARISON 1: ACUPUNCTURE added to STANDARD DOSE ANTIPSYCHOTICS versus STANDARD DOSE ANTIPSYCHOTICS</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>Although different criteria were used to rate 'not improved' all three to 12 month studies favoured the group into which acupuncture was added. The quality of data is not good but if, by this simple addition of acupuncture, even a proportion of the effect seen in these trials was real, that would be clinically important. This finding alone merits further testing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>These trials presented 12 different ways of recording mental state. There were some exceptions and some heterogeneous results, however, essentially, the data favoured the acupuncture group. Most of the measures indicated a modest improvement derived from trials at moderate risk of bias, but findings that were statistically if not clinically significant. These data are certainly consistent with the 'global state' outcomes above and also merit further work.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Attrition was remarkably low. Such high rates of retention are unusual for trials involving people with schizophrenia and probably reflect the differences in approaches to care and the care culture, rather than the treatment interventions, however, the approach and care culture of China, in which these trials were conducted applies to at least 20% of the global population. Acupuncture trials of this sort are clearly are possible in China. More, larger and clearer studies are needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Service outcome</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the 30 included studies reported this important outcome. Acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics did reduce average hospitalisation days compared with standard dose antipsychotics alone. Again, this is consistent with the above results and because it was a study with 120 participants of low quality attempts should be made to replicate this finding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.5 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The wide-ranging Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) scores were lower for those given acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotic treatment. These results are based on a study size of only 90 participants (<LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Yao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Yao 2006</LINK>), but, nevertheless, the general impression remains that acupuncture is not associated with noticeable adverse effects and also that it does little for any existing adverse effects of the medications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. COMPARISON 2: ACUPUNCTURE added to LOW DOSAGE ANTIPSYCHOTICS versus STANDARD DOSE ANTIPSYCHOTICS</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. The low dose antipsychotic was chlorpromazine at less than 300 mg/day, risperidone 1 to 2 mg/d, clozapine 100 to 150 mg/d or, a reduction of about 60% of previously daily levels.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>Relapse, the primary outcome of this review, was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-acupoint-inj-_x002d_-Pan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">acupoint inj - Pan 2002</LINK>. Acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics did reduce the number of participants experiencing relapse compared with standard dose antipsychotics (n = 170, 1 RCT, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.89). The study followed up relapse for two years but the result is questionable because of high risk of bias and incomplete outcome data. The outcome of 'no clinically important change' in global state did not show a benefit for acupuncture group and a similar result was found for the short-term CGI-SI. It is, therefore, difficult to be conclusive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>Rather weak and sometimes heterogeneous data suggest that the additional acupuncture did not really make much difference to participant's mental state. This impression remains even when we removed <LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Wang 2006</LINK>. the study that caused high heterogeneity.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.3 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Again, very, very few people left these studies (~2%) indicating the different circumstances in which these trials were undertaken compared to the studies of Western medicine. Just because this indicates that the studies were different to that seen in the West does not mean the findings are inapplicable. Conversely, it may reflect that people did not feel empowered to leave, and that, perhaps with that dis-empowerment may come results of limited veracity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.4 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>We found TESS endpoint score and RESES endpoint score were lower for people given acupuncture - but the RESES endpoint score was calculated according to the assumption of <I>The Cochrane</I> <I>Handbook or Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>and could incorporate even more error than other data. Data for all other adverse effects are limited and not entirely convincing. It is not clear that the reduction of antipsychotic paired with acupuncture is helpful for a wide range of adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. COMPARISON 3: ACUPUNCTURE versus STANDARD DOSE ANTIPSYCHOTICS</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>The criteria for clinically important change of 'not improved' in global state was not standardised and findings were not consistent. The two trials using the same criteria found in favour of the acupuncture but the other three, employing different measures, were equivocal. This is surprising to those of us who are used to using standard dose antipsychotic drugs. Trials involving nearly 400 people indicate that acupuncture is as potent as antipsychotics - or more so. All studies are limited by their power and quality and high-grade replication is important.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>BPRS score at short-term based on two small studies, <LINK REF="STD-traditional-_x002d_-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">traditional - Wang 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK>. Heterogeneity exists between traditional acupuncture and laser acupuncture subgroup and data from each study drew different conclusions. Findings tend to favour acupuncture for positive symptoms and neither group for negative. Again, if a real finding, these results are similar to those that are found for trials of new antipsychotic drugs. They do tend to be biased in favour of the experimental treatment, in this case acupuncture, but that does not mean that there is a real effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.3 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Again, very high retention rates highlight the difference between these trials and what is seen in most of the rest of the world.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.4 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>For this comparison adverse effect data were limited. As with the other comparisons there is no clear indication of adverse effects of acupuncture, although one study reported the laser acupuncture group experienced numbness over the ear, upper extremity and chest on the treated side.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. COMPARISON 4: ACUPUNCTURE added to TCM DRUG versus TCM DRUG</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>When comparing traditional acupuncture plus capsule with capsule alone there was significant difference in global state (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.59) but the opposite result if comparing electroacupuncture plus decoction with decoction alone (n = 94, 1 RCT, RR 0.77 CI 0.57 to 1.06). We have not really had the power to investigate the different types of acupuncture but this finding indicates that the traditional (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) may well have advantages over the electroacupuncture technique, also that the TCM drug may have little to offer, in itself, for the treatment of people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Rathbone-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathbone 2005b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.2 Behaviour</HEADING>

<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there was no difference in the rates of not improved in global state, however, different approaches were used as well as different definitions of outcome. Two studies with the same criteria indicated that there was no significant difference between traditional acupuncture group and TCM drug group for one definition of 'not improved' (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.74 to 2.87) but when another definition was employed a different result was found (worsening in global state, n = 88, 1 RCT, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). The answer is clearly not stable and should be further investigated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.2 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>No participants dropped out from either the acupuncture or TCM drug group. Low attrition probably refects, at least in part, that both acupuncture and Chinese herb medicine originate from China, have a long and trusted history, and these studies were undertaken in China.</P>

<P>The only relevant study (n = 68) (<LINK REF="STD-EACT-_x002d_-Xue-1987" TYPE="STUDY">EACT - Xue 1987</LINK>), undertaken more than 20 years ago, reported no participants leaving within the 24 days of treatment. The short treatment period and a special approach to care may part of the reason for this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>Thirty studies were included in this update review with more than 2500 participants. We compared acupuncture added to antipsychotic drugs (regular dosage or low dosage) with standard dose antipsychotics; acupuncture plus TCM drug with TCM drug alone; acupuncture with antipsychotic drugs or TCM drug; and also electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy. We found many outcomes were missing such as death, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life or economic outcomes. Most missing outcomes are participant-oriented data.</P>
<P>Only one study reported our primary outcome, relapse, and even that was incomplete. One study reported a service outcome, time in hospital, which was not the pre-stated outcome of our review.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The 30 included studies were published between 1986 and 2011 and almost exclusively completed in China where trial attrition is unusually low compared to the Western world.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture has been used for treating schizophrenia-like illnesses for over 2000 years. Though acupuncture as a complementary treatment has become more popular in the West (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012</LINK>), 29 of the 30 included studies were undertaken in China and the findings are more appropriate to a Chinese population. For this update, new studies were found to compare acupuncture added to a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drug with TCM drug, acupuncture with TCM drug, electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy and we separately analysed acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics versus standard dose antipsychotics or acupuncture adde to low dose antipsychotics versus standard dose antipsychotics. The limited evidence suggests that combining acupuncture with standard dose antipsychotics might benefit the individual's mental state especially in the short-term. Acupuncture appears to have some benefit related to relapse when added to low dose antipsychotics compared to standard dose antipsychotics along with a reduction of drug-related adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Adopting acupuncture to treat schizophrenia needs co-operation between psychiatrists and acupuncturists. Few data were available making the comparisons between acupuncture and antipsychotics, between acupuncture added to TCM drug and TCM, between acupuncture and TCM drug, and between electric acupuncture convulsive therapy and electroconvulsive therapy limited. Acupuncture treatment effects consists of three effects - special effects, non-special effects and psychological effects (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>). Without enough evidence, we could not draw conclusions if the effect of acupuncture when combining with antipsychotics is a placebo response. Without enough evidence we remain confused about the interaction between acupuncture and low dosage antipsychotic medication. Placebo and recognised effective drug-control in three-arm trials need to be conducted to provide strong evidence.</P>
<P>It is surprising that most of the studies used the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) or Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Side Effects (RESES) to assess adverse effects, but few focused on acupuncture's relative adverse effects such as skin allergies. Though acupuncture has a long history, this intervention is still without a special acupuncture-relative adverse effects scale. Adverse effects of acupuncture for schizophrenia are inadequate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers of policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture as a valuable complementary medicine is gradually affecting the global medical treatment system. Only one study reported service outcomes and indicated that using acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics shorten hospitalisation days than using standard dose antipsychotics alone. This traditional treatment originating from ancient Chinese culture needs more real-word trials to evaluate the treatment method objectively and completely, not limited by assessing treatment effects and adverse effects but also focusing on social and economic conditions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>All studies should now comply with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). More transparency in the reporting of randomised controlled trials, would enable readers to understand the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of results. Although binary data is easier to interpret, where continuous data are used, some measure of variance should be provided. Data presented in graphs should be accompanied by exact numbers and standard deviations in the text.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Reviews</HEADING>
<P>There are further refinements of this review that could take place with better inclusion of additional data (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) and possibility of additional comparisons (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). This review is already large and, in the future, it may be best to split this work into separate reviews per comparison with an 'overview' review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Trials</HEADING>
<P>In 2010, the <A HREF="http://www.stricta.info/">STRICTA</A> Group, CONSORT Group and the Chinese Cochrane Centre collaborated to develop STRICA (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2010</LINK>) to ensure that acupuncture trials are more accurately interpreted and more easily replicated. Further research is essential to inform both clinicians and patients about the effects of acupuncture in the treatment of schizophrenia. Trial methodology should follow both <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and <A HREF="http://www.stricta.info/">STRICTA</A> guidelines.</P>
<P>Acupuncture is an important intervention that is likely to be widely used, at least, in China. Considering the limited data in this review, we do think that further large simple trials are indicated. This update highlights the need for standardised clinical trials, which evaluate acupuncture for people with schizophrenia, which thoroughly investigate effects of different categories of acupuncture, which investigate interaction in combination regimens, with trialists employing appropriate real-world methodology. We suggest such a design in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
<P>There are, however, specific issues to consider.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Standardisation of acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>We included 30 studies and five categories of acupuncture according to different stimulation methods and one according to special acupuncture theory application method. The majority used different acupoints and practice procedures. Although acupuncture is an important part of TCM and has the typical characteristics of this approach - individualised treatment - to objectively evaluate the effects of acupuncture standardisation of technique would be useful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Blinding method and sham acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Human behaviour is influenced by what we know or believe and it is a particular risk of human healthcare research. The use of blinding methods makes it more difficult to bias results intentionally or unintentionally and helps ensure credibility of study conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2000</LINK>). Eight studies adapted a blinding method but only four used sham acupuncture. Though appropriate sham acupuncture is a key factor for acupuncture trials, it can also be a barrier for the trialist (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK>). More than 20 studies in this review probably have some degree of performance bias and only seven used blinded assessors. As acupuncture is an externally applied treatment to which special theory is associated, patient-blinding (sham acupuncture) may be difficult, but assessor-blinding is not so problematic. At the very least, to minimise subjectivity, assessor-blinding does need to be practiced in further clinical trials.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Control group</HEADING>
<P>A placebo-controlled (appropriate sham acupuncture) trial is beneficial to confirm absolute effects of acupuncture. We did not find any study of this comparison. In this version of review we reported results of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics versus standard dose antipsychotics;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics versus standard dose antipsychotics;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture versus standard dose antipsychotics;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture added to TCM drug versus TCM drug;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture versus TCM drug; and a special comparison</LI>
<LI>electric acupuncture convulsive therapy versus electroconvulsive therapy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Some of the control group treatments are definitely effective (such as antipsychotics; <LINK REF="REF-Rattehalli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rattehalli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>), but others may be more like a placebo group (e.g. TCM drug - <LINK REF="REF-Rathbone-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathbone 2005b</LINK>). To evaluate the effects of acupuncture choosing recognised valid treatment as the control group would be beneficial to obtain high-quality globally applicable evidence.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Methodology update</HEADING>
<P>The protocol used for this update has been changed and updated: taken from the most recent methodology of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, it acknowledges changes in Cochrane methodology since this review was first published. For example, use of 'Summary of findings' tables instead of calculating NNT/NNH and changes in the 'Risk of bias' tables and 'methods' being described in more detail. We do not think the use of these new methods affects the results or integrity of the review. For previous methodology please see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Type of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The title of this review is broad - 'Acupuncture for schizophrenia'. The previous version used a more narrow range of comparisons and, we felt, left out some that are important. We have added all categories of acupuncture alone or in combination regimens compared with placebo (or no treatment) or any other treatments. For previous types of interventions please see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>1. Electronic searches<BR/>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (April 2005) using the phrase: [(*acup* OR *moxibustion*) in REFERENCE and (*acupuncture* OR *moxibustion*) in STUDY]</P>
<P>This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases (Biological Abstracts CINAHL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, EMBASE, MEDLINE, RUSSMED, LILACS, PSYNDEX and PsycLIT) hand searches and conference proceedings (see Group Module).</P>
<P>2. We also inspected the references of all identified studies (included and excluded) for further relevant trials.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:11:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Selection of studies<BR/>We (JR, JX) inspected all reports of studies identified from the search. A randomly selected sample of 10% of all the reports were re-inspected in order to ensure that the selection was reliable. Where disagreement occurred, we resolved this by discussion and if there was still doubt we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we independently decided whether or not they met the review criteria. Again, where disagreement occurred, we resolved this by discussion and when this was not possible we sought further information from first authors and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify into which category to allocate the trial, we did not enter data but allocated the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. We only included trials in Category A or B in the review.</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.</P>
<P>3. Data extraction<BR/>3.1 Reliable extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added this outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up, except for the outcome of 'leaving the study early'. In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, everyone allocated to the intervention was counted whether or not they completed follow-up. We considered those leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death and adverse effects.</P>
<P>Where attrition rates were high (25% to 50%), we analysed the impact of including this type of data in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of high attrition data resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, then we did not pool this data, but presented the data separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Dichotomous/binary data<BR/>In the review we used relative risk (RR), (fixed-effect) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, we made efforts to convert relevant categorical or continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing them into groups accordingly i.e.. 'moderate or severe impairment' and 'no better or worse'.</P>
<P>4.1.1 Summary statistic: For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimate of the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) (fixed-effect). Where possible, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) using an on-line calculator (http://www.nntonline.net/). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards are applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30-210) the calculation described above in (b) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: For continuous outcomes we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and respective 95% CI (fixed-effect). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and it has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, or may not be valid, or even ad hoc. Therefore, some minimum standards were set: (a) the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) the instrument should either be a self-report, or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and (c) the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible, we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former in this review.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all of the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity and supplemented this by using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate the data, but presented it separately and reasons for heterogeneity were investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered all data from the included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded three studies. <LINK REF="STD-Xue-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhuge-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuge 1993</LINK> were not randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 1995</LINK> compared electro-acupuncture to computerised electrode.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>No studies are awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We are not aware of any ongoing studies.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We included five studies all of which were randomised. Only <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> reported on blinding, in which the raters were blind to treatment allocation.</P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>All included studies were short-term (less than three months). The shortest study <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK> lasted for 20 days. <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> was for five weeks, <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> were six week studies and Zhang 1994 was the longest study lasting eight weeks.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>All participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> used operationalised criteria (DSM/ICD/CCMD). <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK>, Zhang 1994 did not report using predefined diagnostic criteria. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> used male and female participants, whilst Zhang 1994 did not report on gender.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>All five trials were undertaken in a hospital setting.</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>The numbers of participants randomised ranged between 31 <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> to 88 <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK>. Forty people were randomised by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK>, 69 by Zhang 1994 and 42 by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>The treatment groups received acupuncture exclusively or in combination with antipsychotics. All the comparator groups received antipsychotics. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> used electro-acupuncture in combination with reduced dose antipsychotics versus chlorpromazine equivalents (~560mg/day). The treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK> received electro-acupuncture and the comparator group were given chlorpromazine (300-600 mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> randomised people into three comparator groups, laser-acupuncture with moxibustion, laser acupuncture with moxibustion and reduced dose chlorpromazine (150-300 mg/day), or chlorpromazine (350-600 mg/day). Zhang 1994 compared electro-acupuncture to chlorpromazine equivalents (~458 mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> compared electro-acupuncture combined with antipsychotics to antipsychotics alone but did not report on the acupoints used or dosages. Details of acupuncture points, needles and electro-acupuncture frequencies used (when reported) are listed in the included studies table.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>All data outcomes were reported as short-term (less than three months). Data from some studies were unusable because raw scores were not presented. Instead outcomes were reported as P values without means and standard deviations being provided, or the scale used was not identified. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> predefined no clinical improvement as HAMD scores reduced by &lt;/ = 25%. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> predefined no clinical improvement as BPRS scores reduced by &lt;/ = 20%.</P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: details of scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusion of data from instruments are given under 'outcomes' in the included studies table.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state scales<BR/>4.6.1.1.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1970</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI is a three-item scale commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. The items are: severity of illness, global improvement and efficacy index. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> reported CGI data.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Mental state<BR/>4.6.1.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has sixteen items, but a revised eighteen-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from 0 -126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK>and Zhang 1994 all reported BPRS data.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.2 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This scale allows a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia (impoverished thinking), affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Assessments are made on a six-point scale (0 = not at all to 5 = severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Data for this scale were reported by Zhang 1994.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.3 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Zhang 1994 was the only study to report SAPS data.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.4 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HAMD (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1967</LINK>)<BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of the depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five-point or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. A score of 11 is generally regarded as indicative of a diagnosis of mild depression, 14-17 mild to moderate depression and &gt;17 moderate to severe depression. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.5 Zung Depression Scale - ZDS (<LINK REF="REF-Zung-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zung 1965</LINK>)<BR/>The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale is a 20-item self-rated scale that is widely used as a screening tool, covering affective, psychological and somatic symptoms associated with depression. The questionnaire takes approximately ten minutes to complete and items are framed in terms of positive and negative statements. It can be effectively used in a variety of settings, including primary care, psychiatric clinics, drug trials and various research situations. Each item is scored on a Likert scale ranging from one to four. Most people with depression score between 50 and 69, while a score of 70 and above indicates severe depression. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Adverse events<BR/>4.6.1.3.1 Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale/Form - TESS/F (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This checklist assesses a variety of characteristics for each adverse event, including severity, relationship to the drug, temporal characteristics (timing after a dose, duration and pattern during the day), contributing factors, course and action taken to counteract the effect. Symptoms can be listed a priori or can be recorded as observed by the investigator. Zhang 1994 reported data for this scale.</P>

<P>1. The search<BR/>The electronic search identified 18 reports. We were able to include five trials and we added three trials to the excluded studies table.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1. ACUPUNCTURE versus ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>2.1. Global state<BR/>Two studies <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> reported on global state (not improved) with equivocal results.</P>
<P>2.2. Leaving the study early<BR/>There were no losses to follow-up in either group from two trials <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> by five weeks.</P>
<P>2.3. Adverse effects<BR/>Extrapyramidal symptoms reported by <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> were lower in the acupuncture group with no participants experiencing this adverse effect. The control group had significantly higher numbers with eight out of ten people reported as having extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 21, RR 0.05 CI 0.0 to 0.8, NNT 2 CI 2 to 8).</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. ACUPUNCTURE + ANTIPSYCHOTICS versus ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>3.1. Global state<BR/>One study <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> reported global state (not improved at five weeks) with equivocal results. Clinical Global Impression (severity of illness) scores were reported by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> with equivocal scores. <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> also reported on Clinical Global Impression (global improvement) but data were skewed.</P>
<P>3.2.

<P>3.3. Mental state<BR/>Dichotomised BPRS data were reported by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> (not improved &lt;/ = 20% reduction at endpoint) with equivocal results. Continuous BPRS data (Zhang 1994, <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK>) were significant in favour of the acupuncture group (n = 109, WMD -4.31 CI -7.0 to -1.6). Mental state SANS and SAPS score were reported by Zhang 1994, but data were skewed and cannot be displayed graphically. Depression scores from the HAMD scale were reported by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> with scores from this smaller study being significantly lower in the acupuncture group (n = 42, WMD -10.41 CI -12.8 to -8.0). When the HAMD scores were dichotomised to 'not improved', again, by <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> results significantly favoured the acupuncture group (n = 42, RR 0.17 CI 0.1 to 0.5, NNT 2 CI 2 to 3). <LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhang 2001</LINK> also reported on depression using the Zung Depression Scale with results at five weeks significantly favouring the acupuncture group (n = 42, WMD -24.25 CI -28.0 to -20.5).</P>
<P>3.4. Adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-electro-_x002d_-Zhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">electro - Zhou 1997</LINK> reported TESS scores at six weeks, with results significantly favouring the acupuncture group (n = 40, WMD -0.50 CI -0.9 to -0.1). <LINK REF="STD-laser-_x002d_-Zhang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">laser - Zhang 1991</LINK> found the incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms to be similar for both treatment groups.</P>
