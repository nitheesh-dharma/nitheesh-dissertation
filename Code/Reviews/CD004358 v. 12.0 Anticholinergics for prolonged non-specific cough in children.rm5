<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Children with non-specific cough, (non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable chest disease) are commonly treated with a variety of medications for control of cough symptoms. This review examined the effect of inhaled anti-cholinergic drugs in children with non-specific cough. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti-cholinergics as no randomised-controlled trials of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children were found.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-14 09:07:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-15 10:00:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cough is a very common symptom of respiratory disease and the commonest symptom for presentation to family doctors [<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>]. The definition of chronic cough in children varies from longer than 3 weeks to longer than 6 weeks. Prevalence ranges from 3% in Dutch school children [<LINK REF="REF-Spee_x002d_van-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spee-van 1998</LINK>] to 35% in South African children [<LINK REF="REF-Nriagu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nriagu 1999</LINK>]. However, the reporting of isolated cough in questionnaires is however unreliable [<LINK REF="REF-Brunekreef-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunekreef 1992</LINK>] and prevalence figures are probably inaccurate. </P>
<P>Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology [<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>]. Children with a history of nonspecific cough are commonly seen in paediatric practice. The majority have no signs of other current disease processes. In the absence of research to guide clinical practice, these children are treated with a variety of therapies: antibiotics, cough suppressants, anti-histamines, decongestants, bronchodilators, anticholinergics, sodium cromoglycate, inhaled corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids. These interventions sometimes result in significant side effects [<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2002</LINK>].</P>
<P>Children with non-specific cough present a major management problem and cause considerable anxiety to parents. The desire by patients and medical practitioners to treat cough is reflected in the wide use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for coughs and the frequent prescription of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection [<LINK REF="REF-McManus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 1997</LINK>]. Many children with non-specific cough are treated with asthma type medications (corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators). However, beneficial effects of these interventions have not been clearly described. </P>
<P>A Cochrane Review on the use of beta2-agonists for acute bronchitis focused on acute cough (undefined time frame) in adults and children. The reviewers concluded that use of beta2-agonists confers no benefit in the absence of airflow obstruction [<LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2006</LINK>]. This present review focuses on prolonged non-specific cough in children. This condition is most likely to differ from acute bronchitis with respect to the duration of cough (&gt;3 weeks) and the quality of cough (non-productive). </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 11:08:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Retrieval of studies: Abstracts of papers identified from the search were read by both reviewers (ABC, PM) who then independently reviewed potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. In addition ABC wrote to manufacturers of ipratropium with links in Australia. It was planned that agreement would be measured using kappa statistics and disagreement resolved by consensus or third party adjudication (M McKean).</P>
<P>Planned data analysis:<BR/>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria would have been reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible children), inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of anti-cholinergic therapy, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data would have been extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information would have been requested from the authors where required.</P>
<P>Studies included in the review would have undergone quality assessment performed independently by all reviewers. Four components of quality would have been assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment. Trials scored as: Grade A: Adequate concealment, Grade B: Unclear, Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Blinding. Trials scored as: Grade A: Participant and care provider and outcome assessor blinded, Grade B: Outcome assessor blinded, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: No blinding of outcome assessor (Grade A, B = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Reporting of participants by allocated group. Trials scored as: Grade A: The progress of all randomised children in each group described, Grade B: Unclear or no mention of withdrawals or dropouts, Grade C: The progress of all randomised children in each group clearly not described. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
<LI>Follow-up. Trial scored as: Grade A: Outcomes measured in &gt;90% (where withdrawals due to complications and side-effects are categorised as treatment failures), Grade B: Outcomes measured in 80-90%, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: Outcomes measured in &lt;80%. (Grade A = high quality).</LI>
</OL>
<P>While only the allocation concealment quality assessment would have been displayed in the meta-analysis figures, all assessments would have been included in the "Characteristics of included studies" table. Inter-reviewer reliability for the identification of high quality studies for each component would have been measured by the Kappa statistic.</P>
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions would have been calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies would have examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This would take into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest would have been included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were to be calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, REVMAN version 5). The number needed to treat was to be calculated using the summary odds ratio and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies. The cough indices were to be assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes can be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference was to be estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results was to be described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test (where p&lt; 0.1 is considered significant). The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model was to be included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>An a priori sub-group analysis was planned for children less than 7 years of age. Sensitivity analyses were planned to assess the impact of the potentially important factors on the overall outcomes: a) study quality; b) study size; c) variation in the inclusion criteria; d) differences in the medications used in the intervention and comparison groups; e) differences in outcome measures; f) analysis by standard intention-to-treat (children not available for outcome assessment not included) rather than modified intention-to-treat, and g) analysis by "treatment received (children not available for outcome assessment and children who did not receive intervention in accordance with protocol not included) rather than modified "intention-to-treat".</P>

<P>The Airways Group specialised register/search identified 864 potentially relevant titles. After assessing the abstracts, only 4 studies were considered for inclusion into review. Three other studies were further identified from the additional sources. None of the studies fulfilled study criteria. One study did evaluate the effectiveness of an inhaled anti-cholinergic medication in prolonged non-specific cough but only included adults [<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1992</LINK>]. Additional searches in subsequent years (April 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) did not identify any further studies. One study that used nasal ipratropium (for 'colds') was excluded as it did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>No randomised controlled trials of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications for the treatment of persistent non-specific cough in children were identified. A small randomised, double blind, crossover trial involving 14 adults with persistent cough following a viral infection has been conducted [<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1992</LINK>]. The investigators reported an overall clinical improvement and reduction in cough scores in the participants while they were receiving ipratropium bromide (4 puffs of 20 micrograms, four times daily).</P>
<P>At this point, routine use of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications cannot be recommended for children. Parents requesting a trial of therapy should be informed of the lack of any well-designed studies assessing effectiveness, the associated cost of treatment, and the risk of side-effects. The manufacturer of first inhaled anti-cholinergic medications indicated that none of their anti-cholinergic medications are indicated for treatment of cough in children. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti-cholinergics in children with non specific cough. The known adverse events (e.g. paradoxical bronchospasm, paralytic ileus, tachycardia) must also be considered if inhaled cholinergics medications are used. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomised controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications for symptomatic control of cough in children with non specific cough are needed. </P>
