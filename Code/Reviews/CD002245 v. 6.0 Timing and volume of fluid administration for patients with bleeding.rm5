<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-24 15:19:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>About one third of injury deaths are due to shock from blood loss. Preventing shock in people with uncontrolled bleeding is, therefore, very important and is generally done by giving fluids intravenously. The aim is to maintain blood pressure and reduce tissue damage. The composition of these fluids can vary, and there have been systematic reviews comparing different fluid types, but the volume of fluid given and the time at which it is given can also vary. It not yet clear which timing and which volume are the most effective.</P>
<P>The authors searched for relevant medical research reports and found six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2128 people. In each study, people with uncontrolled bleeding were randomly assigned to receive one treatment or another. Three studies were about the amount of fluid given (more or less), and three studies were about giving fluid at different times following injury (sooner or later). The authors were interested in finding out which treatments were better, to reduce deaths and to enable blood clotting. Blood clotting was measured by prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time during fluid administration.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that there is uncertainty about the best time to give fluid and what volume of fluid should be given. While increasing fluids will maintain blood pressure, it may also worsen bleeding by diluting clotting factors in the blood.</P>
<P>The first version of this review was published in 2000 and included these six trials. The authors searched for new, relevant studies in 2003, 2008 and 2014 but none were found. The authors will look for studies in 2020, and any new information will be incorporated into the review.</P>

<P>In the first trial (n = 598) the relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.58).

The WMD for partial thromboplastin time was 7.0 (95% CI 6.0 to 8.0) seconds. In the third trial (n = 1309) the RR for death with early fluid administration was 1.06 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.47).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:15:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 1990 approximately five million people died worldwide as a result of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). For people younger than 35 years, injury is now the leading cause of death. Nevertheless, the global epidemic of injury is only beginning. It is estimated that by 2020, deaths from injury will have increased from 5.1 million to 8.4 million (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). About one third of injury deaths are due to haemorrhagic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Deakin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deakin 1994</LINK>). Acute blood loss following injury leads to a reduction in tissue perfusion and tissue oxygen delivery that, if prolonged, cause lactic acidosis and organ failure. Treatment of haemorrhagic shock involves maintaining blood pressure and tissue perfusion until the bleeding is controlled. Over the past 50 years a number of resuscitation strategies have been used to maintain the blood pressure in trauma patients until bleeding is controlled. The evidence for the effectiveness of these approaches has been the subject of a number of systematic reviews by the Cochrane Injuries Group and by others.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pre-hospital use of medical anti-shock trousers</HEADING>
<P>Medical anti-shock trousers (MAST) were first used in the Vietnam War to stabilise patients with haemorrhagic shock during transportation. After the war, MAST became widely used in the care of bleeding trauma patients. MAST increase blood pressure by compressing the blood vessels in the legs, thus increasing systemic vascular resistance, and by shunting blood from the lower body to the brain, heart and lungs. It was hoped that by increasing venous return to the heart, MAST would maintain the blood flow to vital organs until definitive care was given. Nevertheless, a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of MAST use in pre-hospital trauma care provided no evidence that MAST increase survival, and a suggestion that they may increase the risk of death. The pooled relative risk of death with MAST was 1.13 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.32) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paramedic ambulance crews</HEADING>
<P>In high-income countries, an increasing number of ambulance crews include a paramedic trained in advance life support. Paramedics receive extra training in intubation, intravenous cannulation, and the administration of intravenous fluids. Only a small proportion of paramedic-attended trauma patients require intubation (1%), but a larger proportion (18%) receive intravenous fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholl 1998</LINK>). Because of the strong conviction amongst the public and medical profession that paramedic intervention is beneficial, it has been difficult to conduct randomised controlled trials comparing paramedic and non-paramedic trauma care. However, a review and meta-analysis of four cohort studies gave a significantly increased (P = 0.03) risk of death in paramedic-attended patients (relative risk (RR) 1.26) (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholl 1998</LINK>). Because of the potential for confounding by injury severity, the validity of inferences from cohort studies must be questioned. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that efforts by paramedics to raise the blood pressure of bleeding trauma patients may be counterproductive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Colloid fluid resuscitation</HEADING>
<P>Intravenous fluid administration, with colloid or crystalloid solutions, is the mainstay of the non-surgical management of bleeding trauma patients. Colloids are better than crystalloid solutions in expanding the circulation because they are retained within the blood vessels to a greater extent. Crystalloid solutions rapidly leak out of the blood vessels into the interstitial spaces. After a colloid infusion, the increase in the circulating volume is about the same as the volume of colloid infused, whereas only about one quarter of the volume of a crystalloid infusion remains in the blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1999</LINK>). Although colloids are effective in expanding the circulation there is no evidence that this improves outcomes in critically ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Perel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perel 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The systematic reviews of MAST, paramedic resuscitation and colloid administration call into question the benefits of raising the blood pressure in bleeding trauma patients. But by what mechanisms could fluid resuscitation adversely affect the outcome? Stern, using a swine model of near-fatal haemorrhage, found that attempts to restore blood pressure with crystalloid resulted in increased haemorrhage volume and markedly higher mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1993</LINK>). It was postulated that the increased pulse pressure from crystalloid resuscitation might cause the mechanical disruption of blood clots and worsen bleeding. It has also been proposed that fluid administration might worsen bleeding by diluting clotting factors. In view of the concerns raised by the previous systematic reviews, and by the results of animal models of haemorrhagic hypovolaemia, we have conducted a systematic review of the effect on mortality of early versus delayed fluid resuscitation, and of larger versus smaller fluid volumes.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: trials deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation (i.e. central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained elements convincing the review authors of concealment).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias: trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the other categories.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: trials in which concealment was inadequate (such as alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth).</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-02-23 14:03:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found insufficient evidence for or against the use of early or larger volume fluid resuscitation in the treatment of uncontrolled haemorrhage. While vigorous fluid resuscitation may be life-saving in some patients, results from clinical trials are inconclusive.</P>
<P>Every year, 10s of 1000s of patients receive intravenous fluids in the management of bleeding. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol of the American College of Surgeons recommends the liberal use of isotonic crystalloid to correct hypotension in bleeding trauma patients. Nevertheless, we could find no reliable evidence to support or not to support this recommendation. While we cannot exclude the possibility that we overlooked a large high-quality randomised controlled trial showing that early or larger volume fluid resuscitation is beneficial, we believe that this is unlikely. To identify eligible trials we screened over 6000 potentially relevant reports, searched the reference lists of included trials, and contacted authors and experts in the field.</P>
<P>Six published trials were reviewed. Due to their heterogeneity in terms of types of patients and types of fluids used, we did not attempt to perform a meta-analysis of the studies.</P>
<P>Death was chosen as the primary endpoint in this review for two reasons. First, death is a clinically relevant outcome that matters to patients. Second, death is not prone to measurement error or to reporting bias as are pathophysiological endpoints. Mortality data were available for all six included trials, three on the effect of early fluid resuscitation (<LINK REF="STD-Bickell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bickell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2000</LINK>) and three on the effect of larger volume fluid resuscitation (<LINK REF="STD-Dunham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dutton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortune-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fortune 1987</LINK>). Three trials examined the effect of fluid administration on coagulation. Clotting times were significantly elevated in the immediate resuscitation groups (<LINK REF="STD-Bickell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bickell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1986</LINK>) and the group who received a larger volume (<LINK REF="STD-Dunham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunham 1991</LINK>). The method of randomisation was inadequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bickell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bickell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2000</LINK>) and unclear in another (<LINK REF="STD-Dunham-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunham 1991</LINK>). Allocation concealment was inadequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bickell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bickell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2000</LINK>). Because inadequate randomisation and poorly concealed allocation can bias the results of randomised controlled trials, and because this bias can be large and can operate in either direction, the impact of early or larger volume fluid resuscitation on mortality remains difficult to estimate.</P>
<P>Interpretation of results also needs to be made cautiously due to the heterogeneous nature of the traumatic injuries encountered in these trials. Haemorrhagic shock can be caused by a variety of underlying anatomic injuries. Some of these injuries, such as posterior pelvic fractures, may be more amenable to hypotensive management maintained by a smaller volume of fluid than liver injuries where haemostasis can be difficult to achieve (<LINK REF="STD-Dutton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dutton 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of medical anti-shock trousers, early and larger volume fluid administration and colloid resuscitation are based on the idea that raising the blood pressure in bleeding trauma patients will maintain tissue perfusion and so prevent haemorrhagic shock and its consequences. However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding. In view of the lack of evidence for or against the effectiveness of currently recommended resuscitation protocols and the potential for harm, the balance of risks and benefits of contemporary resuscitation practice warrants careful consideration. Further randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective strategies for the fluid management of bleeding trauma patients.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We found no evidence for or against the use of early or larger volume intravenous fluid administration in uncontrolled haemorrhage. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation in patients with bleeding following trauma. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large, well concealed, randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to establish the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy in haemorrhaging trauma patients, with a focus on specific types of injuries likely to benefit from the appropriate resuscitation strategy in terms of timing and volume of fluids given.</P>

<B>Changes to search methods</B>
</P>
<P>For previous versions of this review the National Research Register (<A HREF="http://www.nihr.ac.uk/">http://www.nihr.ac.uk</A>) was searched. The database is archived and contains research projects only from 2000 to September 2007 therefore it was not searched for updates.</P>
<P>PubMed was also not searched for this version: the Trials Search Co-ordinator assessed from where the included studies originated and as none were retrieved from PubMed it was considered redundant. The present list of sources in the Search Methods section was deemed sufficient.</P>
<P>The authors searched the following clinical trials registries for previous updates:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Clinicaltrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>);</LI>
<LI>World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</A>);</LI>
