<P>
<B>Review Question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:</P>
<P>1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia.</P>
<P>2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.</P>
<P>3. Length of hospital stay</P>
<P>Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery.<BR/>Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to April 2014</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer. </P>
<P>Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1 days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this.</P>
<P>Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self-reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-11-26 16:24:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-26 16:24:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2007. Traditionally, after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery postoperative oral intake is withheld until the return of bowel function. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, evidence-based clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits from early postoperative oral intake.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-22 00:42:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), and the citation lists of relevant publications. The most recent search was conducted 1 April 2014. We also searched a registry for ongoing trials (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) on 13 May 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-23 23:31:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery. Early feeding was defined as oral intake of fluids or food within 24 hours post-surgery regardless of the return of bowel function. Delayed feeding was defined as oral intake after 24 hours post-surgery and only after signs of postoperative ileus resolution.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-21 22:37:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted the data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined continuous data using the mean difference (MD) and a 95% CI. We tested for heterogeneity between the results of different studies using a forest plot of the meta-analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I value. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-23 23:35:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Rates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between study groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). When we considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I = 73%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the study groups in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I = 0%) or a need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women).<BR/>Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (MD -0.32 days, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.03, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I = 52%, moderate-quality evidence) and faster onset of flatus (MD -0.21 days, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I = 23%, moderate-quality evidence). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD -1.47 days, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.68, P = 0.0003, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I = 92%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD -0.25 days, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31, P = 0.003, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I = 68%, moderate-quality evidence). Infectious complications were less common in the early feeding group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02, 2 RCTs, 183 women, I = 0%, high-quality evidence). In one study, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P &lt; 0.00001, 143 women, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-23 23:36:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Early postoperative feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery for either benign or malignant conditions appeared to be safe without increased gastrointestinal morbidities or other postoperative complications. The benefits of this approach include faster recovery of bowel function, lower rates of infectious complications, shorter hospital stay, and higher satisfaction.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-26 17:37:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 4, 2007) on 'Early versus delayed oral fluids and food for reducing complications after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery'</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-21 23:40:49 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Abdominal surgery plays a major role in the treatment of various benign and malignant gynaecologic disorders, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cyst, uterine cancer, and ovarian cancer. In this regard, hysterectomy and removal of ovarian cysts or ovarian tumours are commonly performed procedures. Women, especially those with cancer, frequently undergo multiple procedures during surgery.</P>
<P>There is a widespread belief that intestinal stasis (paralytic ileus), a temporary inhibition of bowel motility, follows all abdominal surgery. The exact cause of this clinical phenomenon is unknown, but proposed mechanisms include stimulation of pain fibres, excessive sympathetic tone, and the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters from the gut wall (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1997</LINK>). Gynaecologists have traditionally withheld postoperative oral intake until the return of bowel function as evidenced by the presence of bowel sounds, a passing of flatus or stool or both, and a feeling of hunger. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence (break down), and anastomotic leakage (leakage of surgically-created connections between parts of the intestine) (<LINK REF="REF-Fanning-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanning 2001</LINK>). This belief has become surgical dogma, unsupported by scientific evidence.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-23 23:49:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Recently, the practice of delayed postoperative oral intake has been challenged by evidence from several gastrointestinal physiologic studies that examine contractile activity of the intestine. Gastric emptying and small intestinal absorptive capacity resume on the first postoperative day while colonic activity normally returns within 48 hours after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 1978</LINK>). These data suggest that postoperative ileus may not occur as a paralysis of the entire bowel with complete absence of any functional contractile activity, as is conventionally assumed (<LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>). If postoperative ileus takes place, it is usually transient and not clinically significant. It is also known that typically the stomach and pancreas secrete one to two litres of fluid daily which are readily absorbed in the small intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Bufo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bufo 1994</LINK>). Women after surgery without a nasogastric tube are therefore tolerating high volumes of fluid even though nothing is given orally. In addition, there are studies demonstrating that physical signs suggestive of resolution of postoperative ileus are not well correlated with the incidence of nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Nachlas-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachlas 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bufo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bufo 1994</LINK>). Based on these findings, withholding oral intake until resolution of postoperative ileus is not an evidence-based practice, and may also be unnecessary.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-23 23:51:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Several clinical benefits of giving food and fluids soon after surgery have been proposed in the literature. Following surgery, optimal nutritional status and maintenance of bowel function contribute significantly to wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Windsor-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windsor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deitch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deitch 1991</LINK>). Early oral intake has also been suggested to be an effective alternative in postoperative stress ulcer prophylaxis as it helps to maintain strength of bowel mucosa. In patients receiving early oral intake, the risk of sepsis is reduced because of decreased bacterial colonisation and reduced migration through defects on the bowel mucosa into blood circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Deitch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deitch 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, an improved sense of well-being was observed in patients who ate sooner (<LINK REF="STD-Schilder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schilder 1997</LINK>). This psychological aspect contributes considerably to the entire postoperative recovery process. Cost effectiveness is another potential advantage of early feeding scheme, as those who begin eating sooner tend to have a shorter length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>Regarding the safety of early postoperative oral intake, evidence from general surgical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Reissman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reissman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1998</LINK>) and a systematic review in women undergoing caesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Mangesi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangesi 2002</LINK>) have shown that early oral intake is safe and does not result in any significant increase in complications. Another systematic review on feeding after gastrointestinal surgery has confirmed that there is no clear benefit in keeping patients "nil by mouth", and that early feeding might be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-26 17:37:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Given the lack of a clear evidence-based rationale for the traditional practice of delaying oral intake after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery, a systematic review of relevant studies will assess potential benefits and harms from early postoperative oral intake. The scope of this review is focused on a specific group of patients, so that results may be more directly applicable. A larger, heterogeneous group of patients (e.g. gynaecology and general surgery patients combined) could potentially complicate results and delay applicability, due to different courses of diseases and operative characteristics.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-22 01:18:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors (KC and EM) undertook study selection, screening the titles and abstracts of articles found in the search. We discarded those studies that were clearly ineligible, but the aim was to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. KC obtained copies of the full-text articles and made copies for EM. Both review authors independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria, resolving disagreements by discussion. We sought further information from the study authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-11-22 00:51:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The review authors independently extracted information using the pro forma designed by the Review Group, resolving discrepancies by discussion. For each included trial, we collected information regarding the study location, study methods (as per quality assessment checklist), participants (age range, eligibility criteria), the nature of the interventions, and data relating to the outcomes specified above. Where possible, we sought missing data from the study authors.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-24 00:40:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The two review authors independently assessed study quality, with discrepancies resolved by discussion. We explored the risk of bias in the included studies, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The domains of bias assessed included selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance (blinding of participants and personnel), detection (blinding of outcome assessors), attrition (incomplete outcome data), and selective reporting.</P>
<P>We present risk of bias assessments for the included studies in tables within the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables, which provide a context for discussing the reliability of the results.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-11-22 01:20:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For dichotomous data, we express results for each study as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we express results from each study as a mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. Meta-analytic methods for continuous data assume that the underlying distribution of the measurements was normal. Hence, skewed data were to be reported in the publication separately as the median and range with non-parametric tests of significance.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-02 15:44:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We examined heterogeneity (variation) between results from different studies by inspecting the forest plot of a meta-analysis for variation in effects. We also considered formal statistical tests, such as tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I value (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) in conjunction with graphical approaches, to determine between-study differences.</P>
<P>When there was substantial unexplained heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP>&gt;50%), we used the random-effects model, and compared pooled results from the fixed-effect and random-effects models.</P>

<BR/>The updated review includes a total of 631 women, increased from the previous total of 413 women. The size of the included studies was: 200 (<LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>), 106 (<LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>), 107 (<LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>), 51 (<LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>), and 167 (<LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>). Each study was conducted in a single university-based hospital. The countries represented were the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>), Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>), and Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>) were conducted essentially in gynaecologic oncology patients. In <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>, the majority of women were gynaecologic oncology patients. Almost all (95%) women in the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>) had benign or pre-invasive gynaecological diagnoses. The women in <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK> were younger (Mean age: 40.8 years in early group, 41.1 years in delayed group) than those in <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK> (Mean age: 56.5 years in early group, 57.7 years in delayed group), <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK> (Mean age: 50.0 years in early group, 52.0 years in delayed group), <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> (Median age: 54 years in early group, 58 years in delayed group), and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK> (Mean age: 54 years in early group, 57 years in delayed group). Body mass index (BMI) was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK> (Mean BMI: 28.5 kg/m in early group, 28.7 kg/m in delayed group), <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> (Median BMI: 23.0 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in early group, 24.0 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in delayed group), and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK> (Mean BMI: 25.0 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in both groups).

In <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>, there were significantly more women in the early group who received epidural analgesia for pain treatment. However, there was no effect on the primary outcome of the feeding regimen and length of hospital stay when this potential confounder was factored into the final statistical analysis model. In <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, estimated operative blood loss was significantly higher in the delayed feeding group (Median blood loss: 800 ml vs. 300 ml). <BR/>

</P>
<P>The definitions of early and delayed feeding schedule varied among included studies in that:</P>
<P>For the early feeding group, the diet schedule applied in <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, appeared to be more aggressive. In <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>, women were started on a soft diet in the morning of the first postoperative day and proceeded to a regular solid diet on the second postoperative day. In <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, participants were offered liquids, mineral water (still), tea, chamomile infusion, or apple juice during the first 24 hours. If no nausea and vomiting, a regular diet of boiled or grilled beef, chicken, or fish was given starting on day 1 and continued for the entire hospital stay. In the remaining studies the participants began a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and then advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. </P>
<P>For the delayed feeding group, the schedule used in <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK> was slightly more conservative than others. After signs of the return of bowel function, women were allowed to have only sips of water before advancing to a liquid diet in the evening of the same day, while in the other studies women were readily started on a liquid diet after the presence of those signs. We note that the criteria for a return of bowel function were similar in all studies.</P>

<I>Outcomes</I>

</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK> reported the incidence of postoperative ileus, which was defined as more than two episodes of vomiting of at least 100 ml each within a 24-hour time period, with associated abdominal distension and no bowel sounds. The other studies indirectly assessed the occurrence of postoperative ileus through the incidence of related postoperative gastrointestinal morbidity. <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK> reported the incidence of nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and nasogastric tube use. <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK> reported the incidence of vomiting and abdominal distension. <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK> reported intensity of abdominal pain and presence of nausea and emesis. Regarding data on postoperative time intervals to the return of bowel function, time to the presence of bowel sound was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>. Time to the first passage of flatus and time to the start or tolerance of solid food were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK> reported time to the first passage of stool.</P>
<P>Length of postoperative hospital stay was reported as means in <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Amatyakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amatyakul 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>. However, these data were reported as medians in <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>, because of the skewed distribution.</P>
<P>For the two studies that assessed wound complications, the reported outcomes vary; <LINK REF="STD-Pearl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pearl 1998</LINK> reported as overall wound complications while <LINK REF="STD-Steed-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK> as wound infection. Meta-analysis results for these dissimilar wound complication outcomes should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>Rates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between the study groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1). This suggests that in women with an 8% chance of developing postoperative ileus with delayed oral feeding, the chance of developing postoperative ileus with early feeding will be between 1% and 10%. When we specifically considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, random-effects model, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I = 73%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Considering each symptom separately, early commencement of oral fluids and food was associated with increased nausea (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.71, P = 0.006, 1 RCT, 195 women, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.3). However, there was no increase in vomiting (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.00, P = 0.73, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I = 2%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.4).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) or in the need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women, moderate-quality evidence) between the study groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.5, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.6).</P>
<P>
<B>1.2 Time to recovery of bowel function</B>
</P>
<P>Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sounds (MD -0.32 days, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.03, P = 0.03, random-effects model, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I = 52%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) and faster onset of flatus (MD -0.21 days, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I = 23%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.2). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD -1.47 days, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.68, P = 0.0003, random-effects model, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I = 92%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.3; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, the proportions of women in the early feeding and delayed feeding groups who tolerated a solid diet were 89% versus 0% on day 1, 10% versus 6% on day 2, and 1% versus 94% on day 3, respectively. However, there was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD -0.25 days, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.4). The time to the first passage of stool was reported in median in <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>. They were also comparable between the study groups (5.0 days in the early feeding group and 5.5 days in the delayed feeding group).</P>
<P>Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31, P = 0.003, random-effects model, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I = 68%, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.5; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).

<B>1.4 Satisfaction and health-related quality of life</B>
</P>
<P>Participant satisfaction and quality of life outcomes related to different postoperative feeding schedules were addressed for the first time in the two newly included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Satisfaction was assessed before hospital discharge by using a visual analogue scale (VAS). In <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, the satisfaction score was higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P &lt; 0.00001, 143 women, moderate-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK>, the satisfaction score was reported as a median (Q&#8321; - Q&#8323;). The scores were 80 (80 - 90) in the early feeding group and 75 (60 - 90) in the delayed feeding group (P = 0.07). For women who had delayed feeding, 65% and 58% wished to eat sooner in <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, respectively.</P>
<P>Quality of life was assessed at 30 days after surgery by using validated questionnaires designed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to measure overall health status in people with cancer in general (EORTC QLQ-C30), and in those with ovarian cancer (EORTC QLQ-OV28). The questionnaires focus on global function, physical function, cognitive function, social function, cancer-related symptoms, and financial impact. There were no statistically significant difference in any of the health-related quality of life domains between the two study groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-24 00:20:12 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Early postoperative feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery appeared to be safe without increased gastrointestinal morbidities and other postoperative complications. From the pooled analysis of ileus-related outcomes, the rates of postoperative ileus (three trials, 279 women), nausea or vomiting or both (four trials, 484 women), and abdominal distention (two trials, 301 women) were comparable between the early and delayed feeding groups. In addition, the rates of overall infectious complications were significantly lower in the participants who had early feeding (two trials, 183 women).</P>
<P>Furthermore, the recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. These include shorter time to the presence of bowel sounds (two trials, 338 women), shorter time to the passage of flatus (three trials, 444 women), and shorter time to starting a solid diet (two trials, 301 women). Importantly, early feeding was associated with reduced length of hospital stay by one day (four trials, 484 women). It also appeared that women with early feeding were more satisfied with the feeding schedule (one trial, 143 women).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-24 00:22:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The two newly included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minig-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Minig 2009b</LINK>, 183 women) have contributed data to most important outcomes of the review, including postoperative ileus, symptoms of nausea or vomiting or both, time to the presence of bowel sounds, time to the passage of flatus, time to the passage of stool, hospital stay, infectious complications, wound complications, pneumonia, and satisfaction. These studies considerably improved the power of the meta-analysis in detecting the difference between study groups for some outcomes. From this updated version of the review, we can be more confident to suggest the safety of early feeding with its benefits for faster recovery of bowel function, shorter hospital stay, and higher satisfaction. This information would be readily applicable to women undergoing major abdominal gynaecologic surgery for benign or malignant conditions, and to healthcare professionals taking care of them.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the difference between study groups on rare complications might not be detected, given the total number of participants in all of the included studies. Also, there were no data on other outcomes that may also be of interest, such as costs and other physiological benefits of early feeding, e.g. the effects on fluid, electrolyte balance, and wound healing. These data would be useful additional information for patients and physicians deciding on individualised postoperative feeding approaches.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-26 18:02:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The five included studies were randomised controlled trials with study groups directly relevant to the review question, and provided consistent outcome data. The allocation methods were generally appropriate. The follow-up was acceptable. There were insufficient studies to assess the risk of publication bias. However, the main methodological concern was with lack of blinding. Because of the context and nature of the studies, it was not possible to blind study participants and difficult or impractical to blind attending physicians. Performance bias may therefore have affected all these studies. It is possible that some outcomes (subjective intestinal morbidities, hospital stay, participants' satisfaction and quality of life) were influenced by the lack of blinding. In addition, outcome assessors were blinded in only one of the five included studies. This raises a concern about detection bias. However, the influence of the lack of blinding of the outcome assessors on study outcomes is unclear. This leads to our rating of the evidence as of moderate quality for subjective outcomes and of high quality for more objective outcomes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-24 00:40:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review addressed an important clinical question with a clearly defined population, intervention, and outcomes. We were able to include directly relevant studies with randomised controlled designs. For this updated version of the review, we searched a registry for ongoing trials (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) in addition to the electronic databases. We also contacted study authors directly for information on relevant studies and on individual study methodology. We explored the risk of bias in the included studies by using the updated Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool, with each domain of bias explicitly considered. We have clearly tabulated the results of the included studies. The results of the studies which contributed to the pooled analyses appeared similar for most outcomes. In the presence of statistically significant heterogeneity, we deployed appropriate statistical analytic tools, i.e. random-effects model for the meta-analyses .</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-02 15:45:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a randomised study comparing early oral feeding and nasogastric decompression followed by feeding at the first passage of flatus in women undergoing major surgery for gynaecologic malignancies (<LINK REF="STD-Cutillo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cutillo 1999</LINK>), early oral feeding was associated with a faster resolution of postoperative ileus, a faster return to a regular diet, an earlier passage of stool, and a shorter postoperative hospital stay. The rates of nausea and vomiting were comparable in both groups. Nearly 90% of women who had a nasogastric tube inserted reported discomfort related to difficulty in swallowing and nasal soreness. </P>
<P>The safety and benefits of early feeding for bowel recovery following major abdominal gynaecologic surgery was also generally supported by findings from studies that were closely relevant but excluded from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Schilder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schilder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacMillan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacMillan 2000</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Schilder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schilder 1997</LINK>, which was a quasi-randomised study comparing early commencement of a clear liquid diet on postoperative day one to delayed feeding until the return of bowel function in gynaecologic oncology patients, those with early feeding tolerated the solid diet earlier (1.88 days versus 2.72 days, P &lt; 0.0001) and had shorter hospital stay (3.12 days versus 4.02 days, P = 0.008). However, the incidence of emesis was higher in the early feeding group, but did not translate to significant adverse outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-MacMillan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacMillan 2000</LINK>, early feeding (a low-residue diet started six hours after surgery) was compared to delayed feeding (a clear liquid diet with the presence of normal bowel sound) in women who had major abdominal or vaginal surgery for benign gynaecologic conditions. While the incidence of postoperative ileus was comparable between the study groups (3% in the early group and 5.8% in the delayed feeding group), the incidence of nausea was higher in the delayed feeding group (23% versus 13%, P = 0.04). There were no differences in perioperative complications, gastrointestinal function, pain scores, pain medication requirement, and fluid and calorie intake between the two study groups.</P>
