<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-09 16:31:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> In preterm infants, is the use of high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) as effective as other non-invasive methods of respiratory support in preventing chronic lung injury and death?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> There are a variety of ways in which non-invasive breathing support can be provided to preterm infants with irregular breathing (apnoea) or lung disease. These include supplemental oxygen given into the incubator, via a head-box or via a nasal cannula; continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) given via nasal prongs or mask; and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) where, in addition to CPAP, inflations of a higher pressure are given intermittently. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and air via small, thin tubes that sit just inside the nostrils. HFNC have recently been introduced as another potential form of non-invasive support.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>This review found 15 randomised studies that compared HFNC with other non-invasive ways of supporting babies' breathing. The studies differed in the interventions that were compared, the gas flows used and the reasons for respiratory support.</P>
<P>
<B>Results:</B> When HFNC was used as first-line respiratory support after birth compared to CPAP (4 studies, 439 infants), there were no differences in the rates of death or chronic lung disease (CLD). HFNC use resulted in longer duration of respiratory support, but there were no differences in other outcomes. One study (75 infants) showed no differences between HFNC and NIPPV as breathing support after birth. When HFNC were used after a period of mechanical ventilation (total 6 studies, 934 infants), there were no differences between HFNC and CPAP in the rates of death or CLD. There was no difference in the rate of treatment failure or reintubation. Infants randomised to HFNC had less trauma to the infant's nose. There was a small reduction in the rate of pneumothorax in infants treated with HFNC. We found no difference between the effect of HFNC compared with CPAP in preterm infants in different gestational age subgroups, though there were only small numbers of extremely preterm and late preterm infants. One trial (28 infants) found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and two other trials (100 infants) found no difference between different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC. For infants weaning from non-invasive respiratory support (CPAP), two studies (149 infants) found that preterm infants randomised to HFNC had a reduced duration of hospitalisation compared with infants who remained on CPAP.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions:</B> HFNC use has similar rates of efficacy to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants for preventing treatment failure, death and CLD. Most evidence is available for the use of HFNC as post-extubation support. Following extubation, use of HFNC is associated with less nasal trauma, and may be associated with reduced pneumothorax compared with nasal CPAP. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in preterm infants comparing HFNC with other forms of primary non-invasive support after birth and for weaning from non-invasive support. Further evidence is also required for evaluating the safety and efficacy of HFNC in extremely preterm and mildly preterm subgroups, and for comparing different HFNC devices.</P>

<P>We identified 15 studies for inclusion in the review. The studies differed in the interventions compared (nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), non-humidified HFNC, models for delivering HFNC), the gas flows used and the indications for respiratory support (primary support from soon after birth, post-extubation support, weaning from CPAP support). When used as primary respiratory support after birth compared to CPAP (4 studies, 439 infants), there were no differences in the primary outcomes of death (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.73; 4 studies, 439 infants) or chronic lung disease (CLD) (typical RR 2.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 6.64; 4 studies, 439 infants). HFNC use resulted in longer duration of respiratory support, but there were no differences in other secondary outcomes. One study (75 infants) showed no differences between HFNC and NIPPV as primary support. Following extubation (total 6 studies, 934 infants), there were no differences between HFNC and CPAP in the primary outcomes of death (typical RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 5 studies, 896 infants) or CLD (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18; 5 studies, 893 infants). There was no difference in the rate of treatment failure (typical RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; 5 studies, 786 infants) or reintubation (typical RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; 6 studies, 934 infants). Infants randomised to HFNC had reduced nasal trauma (typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) &#8722;0.14, 95% CI &#8722;0.20 to &#8722;0.08; 4 studies, 645 infants). There was a small reduction in the rate of pneumothorax (typical RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.06; typical RD &#8722;0.02, 95% CI &#8722;0.03 to &#8722;0.00; 5 studies 896 infants) in infants treated with HFNC. Subgroup analysis found no difference in the rate of the primary outcomes between HFNC and CPAP in preterm infants in different gestational age subgroups, though there were only small numbers of extremely preterm and late preterm infants. One trial (28 infants) found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and two other trials (100 infants) found no difference between different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC. For infants weaning from non-invasive respiratory support (CPAP), two studies (149 infants) found that preterm infants randomised to HFNC had a reduced duration of hospitalisation compared with infants who remained on CPAP.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-09 14:52:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a variety of ways in which respiratory support can be provided to preterm infants with apnoea or parenchymal lung disease non-invasively, i.e. without an endotracheal tube . These include supplemental oxygen given into the incubator, via a head-box or via a nasal cannula; continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) given via nasal prongs or mask; and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) where, in addition to CPAP, inflations of a higher pressure are given intermittently.</P>
<P>Nasal cannulae are small, thin, tapered tubes (usually less than 1 cm in length) that sit just inside each nostril without occluding them (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>). Oxygen delivered by 'low flow' nasal cannulae (LFNC) typically refers to the use of flow rates of less than or equal to 1 litre per minute (L/min). Usually the gas used is unblended (i.e. 100% oxygen), and is neither heated nor humidified. LFNC are commonly used in convalescing preterm infants, often with chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2005</LINK>). Use of LFNC does not appear to provide significant support to pulmonary function (apart from the provision of oxygen) (<LINK REF="REF-Hensey-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast, 'high-flow' nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver oxygen or blended oxygen and air at higher flow rates than LFNC. For the purposes of this review, HFNC delivery is defined as the use of gas flows greater than 1 L/min, although typically higher gas flows (e.g. 2 to 8 L/min) are used (<LINK REF="REF-Hough-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hough 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manley 2012</LINK>). Gas given via HFNC is routinely heated and humidified, as with CPAP. High gas flows in preterm infants may provide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at similar levels to that commonly set with CPAP in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreenan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sreenan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spence-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lampland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lampland 2009</LINK>). Washout of nasopharyngeal dead-space has also been proposed as an important mechanism of action of HFNC (<LINK REF="REF-Dysart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dysart 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frizzola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frizzola 2011</LINK>). In HFNC systems, circuit flow is adjusted according to clinical effect and, although a pressure relief valve is used in some circuits, the internal circuit pressure is not routinely measured. HFNC have been suggested as an alternative form of respiratory support for preterm infants with apnoea, respiratory distress syndrome or chronic lung disease. They appear to be easy to apply and maintain (<LINK REF="STD-Saslow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Saslow 2006</LINK>), and compared to CPAP they appear to be more comfortable for infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osman 2014</LINK>), and are preferred by nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2014</LINK>) and parents (<LINK REF="STD-Klingenberg-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Klingenberg 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nasal CPAP is widely used in premature and term newborns and provides an effective, safe alternative to endotracheal intubation (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2004</LINK>). It has been shown to reduce extubation failure, treat apnoea and respiratory distress syndrome and, by minimising duration of mechanical ventilation, may reduce chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2003</LINK>). The most effective and popular means of administering CPAP is by using short binasal prongs (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2004</LINK>). These prongs are designed to fit snugly into the infant's nostrils with minimal leakage. By contrast, nasal cannulae do not usually occlude the nostrils and have the potential for a large leak around them. Other methods of delivering CPAP to the nose that are in common use include single nasal prongs and nasal masks (<LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2008</LINK>). Oxygen administered by nasal CPAP is usually blended, humidified and heated. In contrast to HFNC, the pressure delivered by nasal CPAP circuits is directly measured and regulated.</P>
<P>Both CPAP and HFNC systems may have adverse effects in newborns. Binasal prongs used to deliver CPAP are associated with trauma to the nasal septum and distortion of the nares (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreenan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sreenan 2001</LINK>). It has been thought that HFNC may cause less nasal injury (<LINK REF="STD-Saslow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Saslow 2006</LINK>), however the use of humidified, unheated HFNC has been associated with mucosal irritation, nasal obstruction or bleeding as well as a possible increase in the risk of nosocomial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Kopelman-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopelman 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopelman-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopelman 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concern has also been expressed about the possibility of lung overdistension and trauma from unmeasured and variable PEEP with HFNC (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hegde-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegde 2013</LINK>). One case associating HFNC with pneumocephalus, pneumo-orbitis and scalp emphysema has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Jasin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasin 2008</LINK>). Other possible risks associated with HFNC include gastric distension or perforation, as has been seen with CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to compare HFNC with other methods of providing non-invasive respiratory support in premature newborn infants.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-09 14:59:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the following criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement or assessment. For each criterion, the assessment was one of the following: yes; no; can't tell. The review authors separately assessed each study and any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>The authors evaluated the following issues and entered them into the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computerised random number generator);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth);  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.  </P>
<P>We classified objective outcomes (for example death, chronic lung disease) in the absence of blinding as unclear for performance bias. We classified subjective outcomes (for example nasal mucosal injury) in the absence of blinding as high risk for bias.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis where possible. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data):  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of any suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more of the reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias, as: </P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.   </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 5. Alternative HFNC models to prevent extubation failure</HEADING>
<P>One study compared different HFNC models (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2010</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the need for reintubation within 72 hours of extubation (3/17 infants treated with Fisher and Paykel, 3/22 infants treated with Vapotherm). There was one death in the Vapotherm group, and one infant in the Fisher and Paykel group developed necrotising enterocolitis. Rates of chronic lung disease were similar between the two groups. Other secondary outcomes were not different or not reported.</P>
<P>One study compared different humidification devices for delivery of HFNC (<LINK REF="STD-Sadeghnia-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sadeghnia 2014</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation, rate of CLD, or other secondary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 6. HFNC for weaning from CPAP</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared the use of HFNC versus continued CPAP for weaning preterm infants who were stable on low levels of CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel-Hady-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel Hady 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Badiee-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Badiee 2015</LINK>). In one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel-Hady-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel Hady 2011</LINK>), infants randomised to HFNC had a longer total duration of oxygen therapy (median 14 days vs median 5 days P &lt; 0.001) and a longer period of respiratory support (median 18 days vs median 10.5 days, P &lt; 0.05). Infants in the HFNC group had a slightly longer duration of respiratory support prior to randomisation (median 8.5 days, IQR 7 to 14.25) compared with the CPAP group (median 5.5 days, IQR 3 to 13, P = 0.07). In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Badiee-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Badiee 2015</LINK>), infants randomised to HFNC had a shorter duration of oxygen therapy (21 hours vs 50 hours); however, infants in this group commenced weaning at an earlier gestational age (32.2 weeks vs 33.6 weeks). Four babies in the CPAP group required intubation in one study, while no infants randomised to HFNC weaning required intubation. There was no difference in weaning failure, nor in major morbidities (sepsis, IVH, BPD). There was a small overall reduction in length of hospitalisation in infants receiving HFNC (typical RD &#8722;3.3 days, 95% CI &#8722;6.6 to 0.0 days; 2 studies, 149 infants).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-02-09 16:58:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified 15 randomised trials including a total of 1725 premature infants that compared respiratory support with high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants. There were no studies comparing HFNC with ambient oxygen or low flow nasal cannulae (LFNC). Subgroup analysis by GA was only possible for the comparison of HFNC with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for preventing extubation failure.</P>
<P>The 15 studies varied in study quality. None of the studies were blinded and bias may have occurred, particularly where there were no established criteria for treatment failure/reintubation, or where rescue treatment with other forms of respiratory support was permitted. We did not perform a sensitivity analysis for study quality.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">HFNC for primary respiratory support after birth</HEADING>
<P>For preterm infants needing primary respiratory support after birth, there were no differences in the rates of primary or secondary outcomes between HFNC and CPAP, or HFNC and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Four studies compared HFNC with CPAP, while only one study compared HFNC with NIPPV. Studies varied in the HFNC gas flows used and in the degree of prematurity of infants. Subgroup meta-analysis was not possible, as data for GA subgroups were available for only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yoder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yoder 2013</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">HFNC for respiratory support after extubation</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies evaluated HFNC as respiratory support post-extubation. Overall, there was no difference in the rates of death or CLD in 934 preterm infants treated with HFNC or CPAP. There were no differences in the rates of treatment failure or reintubation. Infants treated with HFNC had a small reduction in the rate of pneumothorax (NNTB 50), and there was an apparent (though not significant) reduction in the rate of necrotising enterocolitis (NNTB 50). Subgroup analysis revealed a small reduction in the rate of reintubation in infants of 28 to 32 weeks' gestation treated with HFNC (NNTB 17). However, subgroup data were not available for all studies, and there were relatively few extremely preterm infants (&lt; 28 weeks' GA) included in the studies we identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">HFNC for weaning from CPAP</HEADING>
<P>Two small studies assessed the use of HFNC for stable preterm infants weaning off respiratory support. Those studies found a small reduction in length of hospitalisation, but no difference in weaning failure or major morbidities..</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Duration of support</HEADING>
<P>Three studies included in this review reported a longer duration of weaning from respiratory support in the HFNC group. <LINK REF="STD-Abdel-Hady-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel Hady 2011</LINK> found that infants randomised to HFNC (compared with those remaining on CPAP) received a longer total duration of respiratory support and a longer period of oxygen. Infants randomised to HFNC had a longer period of respiratory support prior to enrolment than those infants randomised to CPAP, which may have contributed to the difference. <LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 2015</LINK> found longer median duration of respiratory support compared with NIPPV. <LINK REF="STD-Yoder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yoder 2013</LINK> identified a longer duration of respiratory support compared with CPAP for preterm infants receiving HFNC as primary support (but not post-extubation).</P>
<P>The significance of this finding is unclear. Other studies found no difference in the duration of respiratory support between HFNC and CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Manley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Manley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Badiee-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Badiee 2015</LINK> found a lower duration of oxygen in infants weaned from CPAP using HFNC (2 L/min). Meta-analysis was not possible, because of the different interventions compared and different methods for quantifying and reporting duration of support. It is possible that the lower flow rates of HFNC used in <LINK REF="STD-Abdel-Hady-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel Hady 2011</LINK> (2 L/min) and <LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 2015</LINK> (starting flow rate 1 L/min) contributed to slower weaning.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nasal trauma</HEADING>
<P>Nasal trauma was less common in HFNC-treated infants than infants treated with alternative means of respiratory support in seven of the studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Nair-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodhead-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Woodhead 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iranpour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Iranpour 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Manley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yoder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mostafa_x002d_Gharehbaghi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mostafa-Gharehbaghi 2014</LINK>); but no difference was seen in two ( <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 2015</LINK>). Studies varied widely in the tools used to assess the severity of nasal injury. Only one study attempted to blind assessment of nasal mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Woodhead-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Woodhead 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different forms of HFNC</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence from one small study of benefit from humidification of HFNC (<LINK REF="STD-Woodhead-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Woodhead 2006</LINK>). During the second half of the crossover trial infants treated with non-humidified HFNC had a higher rate of being switched to humidified HFNC because of perceived treatment failure. This may have related to the higher flow rates used in infants receiving humidified HFNC. There were higher (more abnormal) scores for nasal mucosal injury in infants treated with non-humidified HFNC.</P>
<P>There was no difference in effectiveness between two different models of equipment used to deliver HFNC in two other small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadeghnia-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sadeghnia 2014</LINK>). None of the included studies examined the effect of different flow rates or cannula sizes.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-20 19:08:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-08 13:03:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>HFNC has similar rates of efficacy to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants for preventing treatment failure, death or BPD. Most evidence is available for the use of HFNC as post-extubation support. Following extubation, HFNC is associated with lower rates of pneumothorax and nasal trauma compared with nasal CPAP.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-20 19:08:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in preterm infants comparing HFNC with other non-invasive supports as primary respiratory support, particularly in extremely preterm and late preterm infants, and comparing different HFNC devices. Further studies are needed to clarify possible benefits of HFNC post-extubation in subgroups of preterm infants, or in reducing pulmonary or gastrointestinal complications. Although the evidence for HFNC use is strongest as post-extubation support, there are currently inadequate data on its use in extremely preterm infants.</P>
