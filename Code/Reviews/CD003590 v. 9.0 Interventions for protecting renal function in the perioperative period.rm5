<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 18:26:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The kidneys may be damaged during an operation as a result of direct and indirect insult. The reasons for this are multiple and include changes to physiology brought on by the surgery and by the body&#8217;s response to such insult. Damage to kidneys during the perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This updated Cochrane review looked at 72 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 4378 participants (search data until August 2012); interventions most often included pharmacological interventions (administration of dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, <I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine, atrial natriuretic peptide, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin) or selected hydration fluids. We attempted to identify any possible damage to the kidneys by evaluating kidney function up to seven days after the operation.</P>
<P>No clear evidence from available RCTs suggests that any of the measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period are beneficial. These findings held true in 14 studies of patients with pre-existing renal damage and in 24 studies that were considered of good methodological quality. The primary outcomes of these studies were mortality and acute renal injury. Reported mortality in studies with low risk of bias was not different between intervention and control groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.97) or for acute renal injury (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03). The summary of findings revealed a similar picture. So we conclude that evidence suggests that none of the interventions used currently are helpful in protecting the kidneys during the perioperative period, nor do they cause increased harm.</P>

<P>Various methods have been used to try to protect kidney function in patients undergoing surgery.

<P>This review is aimed at determining the effectiveness of various measures advocated to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period.</P>
<P>We considered the following questions: (1) Are any specific measures known to protect kidney function during the perioperative period? (2) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period, does any one method appear to be more effective than the others? (3) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period,does any one method appear to be safer than the others? </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1988 to August 2012). We originally handsearched six journals (<I>Anesthesia and Analgesi</I>a, <I>Anesthesiology</I>, <I>Annals of Surgery</I>, <I>British Journal of Anaesthesia, Journal of Thoracic</I> <I>and Cardiovascular Surgery,</I> and <I>Journal of Vascular Surgery) </I>(1985 to 2004). However, because these journals are properly indexed in MEDLINE, we decided to rely on electronic searches only without handsearching the journals from 2004 onwards.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected all randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing surgery for which a treatment measure was used for the purpose of providing renal protection during the perioperative period.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected 72 studies for inclusion in this review. Two review authors extracted data from all selected studies and entered them into RevMan 5.1; then the data were appropriately analysed. We performed subgroup analyses for type of intervention, type of surgical procedure and pre-existing renal dysfunction. We undertook sensitivity analyses for studies with high and moderately good methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 18:25:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The updated review included data from 72 studies, comprising a total of 4378 participants. Of these, 2291 received some form of treatment and 2087 acted as controls. The interventions consisted most often of different pharmaceutical agents, such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, NAC, ANP, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and EPO or selected hydration fluids. Some clinical heterogeneity and varying risk of bias were noted amongst the studies, although we were able to meaningfully interpret the data. Results showed significant heterogeneity and indicated that most interventions provided no benefit.</P>
<P>Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies and data on acute renal injury in 44 studies (all interventions combined). Because of considerable clinical heterogeneity (different clinical scenarios, as well as considerable methodological variability amongst the studies), we did not perform a meta-analysis on the combined data.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of major interventions and surgical procedures showed no significant influence of interventions on reported mortality and acute renal injury. For the subgroup of participants who had pre-existing renal damage, the risk of mortality from 10 trials (959 participants) was estimated as odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.52; the risk of acute renal injury (as reported in the trials) was estimated from 11 trials (979 participants) as OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80. Subgroup analysis of studies that were rated as having low risk of bias revealed that 19 studies reported mortality numbers (1604 participants); OR was 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.90. Fifteen studies reported data on acute renal injury (criteria chosen by the individual studies; 1600 participants); OR was 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No reliable evidence from the available literature suggests that interventions during surgery can protect the kidneys from damage. However, the criteria used to diagnose acute renal damage varied in many of the older studies selected for inclusion in this review, many of which suffered from poor methodological quality such as insufficient participant numbers and poor definitions of end points such as acute renal failure and acute renal injury. Recent methods of detecting renal damage such as the use of specific biomarkers and better defined criteria for identifying renal damage (RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end-stage renal failure) or AKI (acute kidney injury)) may have to be explored further to determine any possible benefit derived from interventions used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-09 18:28:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Intraoperative changes in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are common. Postoperative renal dysfunction is mainly attributed to adverse events that occur during the perioperative period, including hypotension, hypovolaemia and sepsis, or it may be due to perioperative administration of contrast material (<LINK REF="REF-Morcos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morcos 2004</LINK>). The reported risk of perioperative renal failure varies according to aetiology, definition and type of surgery; acute renal failure during the perioperative period is a serious complication associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. When postoperative renal dysfunction occurs, it is generally thought to be multi-factorial in nature.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 18:28:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Over the past few decades, attempts have been made to protect the kidneys both during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>). Various regimens, such as low-dose dopamine, dopexamine, fenoldopam or diuretics, have been tried. The results are somewhat uncertain, hence a number of other measures have been tried. These include <I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Adabag-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Adabag 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barr-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ristikankare-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ristikankare 2006</LINK>), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitaka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitaka 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2009</LINK>) and erythropoietin (EPO) (<LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>). Amongst nephrologists, considerable enthusiasm has surrounded the potential for EPO to provide some renal protection (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different tests, some simple and some complicated, are used with varying success to detect acute kidney injury (AKI) in the perioperative period. Measurement of urine output over a 24-hour period after surgery is one of the simpler tests. A commonly used measure is creatinine clearance, which is often examined by using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, which takes into consideration the age, body weight and sex of the individual, as well as serum creatinine levels. Glomurular filtration rate (GFR) can be measured, as can renal plasma flow. Other tests include assessment of the ability of kidneys to clear a water load (free water clearance) and to excrete sodium (fractional excretion of sodium).</P>
<P>Several newer tests are used as markers of renal damage. The ratio in urine of microalbumin to creatinine (<LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2008</LINK>) has been used but is considered an index of kidney damage, most often in chronic kidney disease. Urinary <I>N</I>-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG) to creatinine ratio (<LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitaka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitaka 2008</LINK>), retinol-binding protein (RBP) to creatinine ratio and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to creatinine ratio are newer methods that can be used to detect renal damage; we have looked at these tests in preparing this update of the review. Plasma cystatin C (CysC) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haase-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haase 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harten-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harten 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2006</LINK>) is another available marker. In a recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Endre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endre 2011</LINK>), glutamytranspeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), NGAL, CysC, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were used in intensive care units as biomarkers of acute kidney injury.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Over the past few decades, several strategies have been used to attempt to protect the kidneys both during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period on a physiological basis (maintaining adequate cardiac output, maintaining renal vasodilatation, suppressing renal vasoconstriction and maintaining renal tubular flow). Various pharmacological regimens, such as use of low-dose dopamine, dopexamine, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or diuretics, have been tried. Some success has been reported with such interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Welch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Welch 1995</LINK>) but no clear evidence of success (<LINK REF="REF-Renton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renton 2005</LINK>) or of deterioration in renal function has been found (<LINK REF="STD-Lassnigg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lassnigg 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dopamine, an endogenous catecholamine, given at a dose of 2 µg·kg·min to 5 µg·kg·min (low-dose or renal dopamine), causes renal vasodilatation with a dose-dependent increase in renal blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seri-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seri 1988</LINK>); at higher doses, dopamine augments renal blood flow by increasing cardiac output through &#946;-adrenergic stimulation. The effect of dopamine has been studied extensively over the years (<LINK REF="REF-ANZICS-CTG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZICS CTG 2000</LINK>). The net sum of these actions is seen as an increase in renal blood flow, an increase in GFR, diuresis and natriuresis. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, attenuates ischaemic reperfusion injury through multiple mechanisms, including maintenance of glomerular filtration pressure, prevention of tubular obstruction by cellular casts, scavenging of hydroxyl free radicals and prevention of cellular swelling (<LINK REF="REF-Schrier-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrier 1984</LINK>). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, blocks ion transport activity in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and enhances tubular oxygen balance by decreasing tubular oxygen demand and consumption. However, loop diuretics also cause renal cortical vasodilatation, resulting in redistribution of blood flow, which could undermine the benefit previously described (<LINK REF="REF-Moitra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moitra 2009</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers appear to confer protection against intracellular calcium injury in ischaemic reperfusion injury (<LINK REF="REF-Schrier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrier 1991</LINK>). Rapid administration of fluids results in expansion of intravascular volume, leading to an increase in cardiac output. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive and salt-retentive properties of angiotensin &#1030;&#1030; and between the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>). In the kidneys, ACE inhibitors decrease glomerular capillary pressure by decreasing arterial pressure and by selectively dilating efferent arterioles (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has a variety of biological actions. It is an antioxidant (<LINK REF="REF-Zafarullah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zafarullah 2003</LINK>); it stimulates endothelium-derived relaxing factor, thereby improving microvascular flow (<LINK REF="REF-Kiefer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiefer 2000</LINK>); and it increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels, thereby acting as a vasodilator and as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. These various clinical actions might have led several investigators to focus on the use of NAC for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tepel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tepel 2000</LINK>). The natriuretic peptides play an important role in cardiovascular, renal and endocrine homeostasis. The natriuretic and diuretic actions of ANP are due to renal haemodynamic and direct tubular actions (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1998</LINK>). ANP increases GFR by increasing pressure within the glomerular capillaries (<LINK REF="REF-Marin_x002d_Grez-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin-Grez 1986</LINK>). ANP also inhibits angiotensin II&#65293;stimulated sodium and water transport in proximal tubules (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1987</LINK>), vasopressin-stimulated water transport in the collecting tubules (<LINK REF="REF-Dillingham-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillingham 1986</LINK>) and sodium absorption in the inner medullary collecting duct (<LINK REF="REF-Sonnenberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonnenberg 1986</LINK>). The combined effect of all of this consists of natriuresis and diuresis. Thus ANP has been used to try to counteract the two proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of decreased GFR in AKI, namely, reduced glomerular perfusion and tubular obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Edelstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelstein 1997</LINK>). Accumulating evidence indicates that EPO has tissue protective or pleiotropic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiese-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiese 2005</LINK>) that may be useful in preventing or treating AKI. The protective mechanisms are multi-factorial and involve inhibition of apoptotic cell death, stimulation of cellular regeneration, inhibition of deleterious pathways and promotion of recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The previously published version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Zacharias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharias 2008</LINK>) was unable to detect much benefit derived from various interventions to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period. The efficacy of dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, NAC, ANP, sodium bicarbonate, EPO and antioxidants has yet to be proved in the capacity of reversing or preventing AKI during the perioperative period. In this updated review, we are taking a fresh look at the current status of this important topic.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We evaluated for appropriateness of inclusion all studies obtained by the search methods described above, as well as their abstracts and summaries. We obtained full publications for those studies, which required further assessment. Two of the review authors (MZ, NPC or PS or MM) evaluated these studies without prior consideration of the results, and consensus was reached on the final selection. Colleagues at the local hospital or university translated some of the selected studies into English.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We used specifically designed data extractions forms to extract the relevant data (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Two authors (MZ, NC or PS or MM) separately extracted and compared data. We resolved differences by discussion and reaching consensus. Wherever we considered it necessary, we attempted to contact the authors for further clarification, data, or both, with limited success.</P>
<P>The data collected included the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reported mortality or acute renal failure.</LI>
<LI>Nature of the surgical intervention.</LI>
<LI>Nature of the intervention used.</LI>
<LI>Methodological quality (risk of bias) of the study.</LI>
<LI>Presence of pre-existing renal damage.</LI>
<LI>Any other relevant information.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Results of the individual studies were reported in many different ways, including means, standard deviations (SDs), standard errors of the mean (SEMs), median or interquartile ranges (IQRs) or ranges. We converted standard errors of the mean and interquartile ranges to standard deviations using appropriate formulae. We considered the interquartile range to be 1.35 times the standard deviation (for the purpose of this review, we assumed that the data were normally distributed). We calculated the standard deviation as the square root of the sample size times the standard error of the mean.</P>
<P>We considered creatinine clearance as a surrogate measure of GFR. When data involved weights, we made an assumption of 70 kg to convert the data. When data were presented in graphical form, we extracted the numerical data from the graphs as accurately as possible. We converted all data to uniform measurements; thus urine output, creatinine clearance, renal plasma flow and free water clearance were expressed in mL/min and fractional excretion of sodium as a percentage, urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio as mg/mg, U-NAG (<I>N</I>-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase)/creatinine ratio as mcmol/mmol, urinary retinol-binding protein/creatinine ratio as mcg/mmol, urinary NGAL (urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin)/creatinine ratio as ng/mmol and plasma cystatin C as mg/L.</P>
<P>In this review, we chose to look at data for the various renal function tests at 24 hours, two to three days and five to seven days, because these were the times that the results were most frequently reported in the selected studies. We were reluctant to look at data collected earlier than 24 hours because these would have shown acute changes brought on by anaesthesia and surgery. Even though it is not specified in most of the publications, we assumed that data on urine output at 24 hours reflect the average reading for urine output in the first 24 hours after surgery; the same applies to urine output results at two to four days and five to seven days postoperatively. For measurements such as creatinine clearance, renal plasma flow, free water clearance and fractional excretion of sodium, we assumed that the data were obtained at the specified time.</P>

<P>In the 2008 update (<LINK REF="REF-Zacharias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharias 2008</LINK>), we identified 136 studies from the MEDLINE search, 113 studies from the EMBASE search and 177 from CENTRAL (426 studies in total). We searched reference lists and bibliographical data from all retrieved articles and reviews for additional, relevant material. We sought information from authors of published studies and contacted recognized experts on this topic about any unpublished data. We identified a further 25 studies by this method. Thus in 2008, a total of 451 studies were considered potentially eligible for this review.</P>
<P>The extended search strategy in 2011 yielded 655 studies, and four studies were obtained from other sources. Of these, we obtained full papers for 35 studies and included 26 additional studies in the review. A further search in August 2012 provided a further 318 studies. From this group, we added one study to the review, one conference presentation to the list of studies awaiting further analysis and one exclusion due to duplicity.

<P>Even though we included 72 studies in the review, the overall methodological quality of the studies was poor. We used a quality assessment system (see 'Methodological quality of studies' <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) based on method of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding and reporting of dropouts as the criterion. We scored the methodological quality of selected studies as good, moderately good or poor. When randomization, allocation concealment and blinding (participants, researchers, care givers and nurses) were adequately described and appropriately done, we classified the study as a good quality study. When randomization, allocation concealment and blinding (participants, researchers, care givers and nurses) were stated to have been done but no details were given in the publication, we classified the study as moderately good. When we found no evidence of allocation concealment and blinding, we classified the study as having poor methodological quality.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We collected and analysed data from the selected 72 studies.</P>
<P>The dichotomous data (mortality and acute renal failure) consisted of rare events, so we used the Peto method of analysis and reported these results as Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented all continuous data results as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. Results were plagued by heterogeneity throughout the analyses, so we used a random-effects model instead of a fixed-effect model. We undertook subgroup analysis for treatment measures and type of surgery. We were able to conduct only limited subgroup analysis for studies with pre-existing renal impairment because of the inadequate number of trials identified. A limited sensitivity analysis was done for studies with low risk of bias. To make the review less cumbersome for the reader, study results are listed in the text only when they were considered essential; references to appropriate 'Data and Analysis' tables are given.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies, which included 3116 participants. Many cases of mortality were due to a combination of factors, including surgical causes and pathology. The risk of mortality was very low, and we did not perform a meta-analysis because of the significant clinical heterogeneity noted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acute renal injury</HEADING>
<P>Acute renal injury (renal damage) in the postoperative period was reported in 44 studies. Many studies did not specify the criteria used to diagnose acute renal failure (ARF), hence we obtained information from these studies on the numbers of participants with acute renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy, in both treatment and control groups. Reported incidences were very low, and because of the significant clinical heterogeneity observed, we did not perform a meta-analysis of the data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of measures used for renal protection</HEADING>
<P>In this section, we tried to combine the data from the 72 identified studies to ascertain the effectiveness of treatments provided to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period compared with findings in the control population. Again, because of clinical heterogeneity in the form of different procedures and populations and decades of reporting such data, we decided to refrain from combining the data for a meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of various interventions on renal protection</HEADING>
<P>Most studies looked at dopamine and its analogues, although some trials used other measures to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Renal dysfunction after major surgery is one of the causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The cause of renal injury in the postoperative period is thought to be multi-factorial. Over the past three or four decades, many studies have tried to identify interventions that could provide renal protection during the perioperative period. Many different interventions have been tried, such as continuous infusions of dopamine or its analogues, use of diuretics such as mannitol and diligent use of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, to name a few. Drugs such as <I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine (NAC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin (EPO) are some of the more recent interventions. None of these interventions appears to have a good evidence base.</P>
<P>We were unable to combine the whole data because of significant heterogeneity among selected studies. Given the large range of treatments, operation types and methods used to protect the kidneys, it is not surprising that heterogeneity is large. Heterogeneity could have been the result of multiple causes, including differences in the nature of treatment, the duration of treatment or participants' conditions, and of course it could have been related to the methodological quality of the studies. We used subgroup analyses to explore this further.</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses for the different interventions that were studied. Dopamine and its analogues showed no improvement in urine output or in other tests such as creatinine clearance, free water clearance or fractional excretion of sodium. Overall, on the basis of available studies, it appears that dopamine and its analogues do not offer much protection to the kidneys. It is worth noting that in a multi-centre study of participants in intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-ANZICS-CTG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZICS CTG 2000</LINK>), no significant benefit of dopamine was noted for these seriously ill individuals.</P>
<P>A 'Summary of findings' table, which used only low risk of bias studies, showed no benefit derived from interventions for domains of mortality and acute renal injury requiring dialysis. We looked at the effects of some of the major interventions (dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, atrial natriuretic peptide, <I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine, IV fluids and EPO) and major surgical procedures (cardiac surgery and abdominal aortic surgery), as well as groups of participants identified as having pre-existing renal damage; none of these groups showed a significant change in reported mortality or renal injury (as reported in the individual studies) in treatment groups versus control groups.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 18:28:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Many physiological and biochemical variables can be used as markers of change in renal function. The various trials included in this review used numerous different markers as indicators of altered renal function. Each test has significant limitations, and results of the analysis must be interpreted in the context of these limitations.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Plasma creatinine is the most frequently measured marker of renal function. It is assumed that plasma creatinine remains constant and that clearance of creatinine occurs solely by glomerular filtration. Thus plasma creatinine is an indirect determinant of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, a greater than 50% reduction in GFR is needed before a change in plasma creatinine is seen. Plasma creatinine also reflects an individual's muscle mass, and alterations in muscle mass influence the plasma creatinine concentration, which does not reflect changes in GFR. A small amount of tubular excretion of creatinine occurs, which, in terms of normal GFR, is insignificant. However, with severe renal impairment, tubular secretion of creatinine has a greater role, and therefore plasma creatinine does not accurately reflect GFR. GFR is usually determined by the clearance of an inert substance, which is freely filtered at the glomerulus and has no tubular secretion or reabsorption. The gold standard has been estimation of inulin clearance. Creatinine clearance correlates well with GFR. For accuracy, it is essential that creatinine clearance is determined correctly. This requires a timed and complete collection of urine, along with a plasma creatinine determination. A variety of formulae have been derived that are based on plasma creatinine, body weight and age and are to estimate creatinine clearance and hence GFR. When renal function is stable, these estimates correlate well with measured GFR (r = 0.9).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Urine output is a non-specific measure of renal function. Clearly, if no urine is produced, then no glomerular filtration occurs. However, urine output can be influenced by several factors that regulate renal tubular handling of water. Oliguria (&lt;400 mL urine/24 h) may just reflect excess salt and water retention by the kidney due to low fluid intake, not necessarily impaired renal function or the effects of increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release&#65293;a normal response to surgery or stress.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>In clinical practice, renal blood flow is rarely determined, but this can be done by using clearance techniques using the Fick principle.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Free water clearance measures urinary concentrating ability. Any form of damage to the kidney impairs urinary concentrating ability. With renal tubular injury, free water clearance is impaired. Likewise, free water clearance is modified by diuretic therapy.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The fractional excretion of sodium has been used as a marker of renal function. More correctly, it reflects renal tubular reabsorption of sodium. The normal physiological response to a reduction in renal perfusion and glomerular filtration is to activate the tubular glomerular feedback mechanism, leading to increased reabsorption of sodium, along with water. The net effect consists of increased blood pressure and hence renal perfusion. In the acute situation (the first 24 hours after an event that affects renal function), low fractional sodium excretion (FeNa &lt; 1%) indicates impaired renal perfusion. With any form of established renal damage, or the use of diuretics, the fractional excretion of sodium is increased and becomes impossible to interpret. It is, therefore, essential that the changes in markers of renal function that were recorded in the analysed papers are examined critically for the variables that influence reported measurements. Conclusions drawn from the results should be closely examined for the validity of the renal function measures that were used. An inability to correctly interpret the results prompted us to refrain from analysing the data on FeNa and instead to provide the raw data.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Newer advances in determining acute renal injury have been reported. These include use of various biomarkers such as urinary <I>N</I>-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG) to creatinine ratio, urine retinol-binding protein (RBP) to creatinine ratio and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to creatinine ratio and blood plasma cystatin C levels. We have looked at these tests in this review update.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We believe it is important to emphasize that the lack of statistical significance described in this review could be due to many factors. We have already discussed heterogeneity as a significant factor; causes of heterogeneity include different types and durations of operations, gender differences, smoking status, state of nutrition, age, alcohol intake and co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or other unknown causes. The potential role of publication (or small sample) bias is also important. One of the common methods employed to facilitate recognition of publication bias is the funnel plot. The most common reasons for small sample bias are the reluctance of trialists or journal editors to publish because results are non&#65293;statistically significant, but other reasons include small numbers of cases investigated in trials; lack of allocation concealment; and inadequate blinding. All of these events may result in misleading positive outcomes, leading to publication bias. Apart from visual examination of funnel plots, various complicated statistical methods are available, but none are wholly satisfactory for recognizing and avoiding small sample bias. A high level of suspicion is always required when reviews consisting of poor quality studies and studies with small sample sizes are interpreted, as with this review. Of particular concern are the high I<SUP>2</SUP> values seen in many analyses; these may be due to significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Results obtained with the use of diuretics were disappointing and suggested no real advantage for participants who received the treatment. The same is true for the use of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, both of which apparently offer no advantages. The use of hydration fluids also showed no obvious advantage for clear fluids over specialized colloid solutions, although the methodology of the studies and the information provided were of poor quality. It is interesting to note that only four studies investigated the role of different types of intravenous fluids in the perioperative setting, although in most studies participants were well hydrated. <LINK REF="STD-Wahbah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wahbah 2000</LINK> makes special mention of the fluid status of participants. Is it simply that kidneys are at their happiest when they have a good pre-load to wash out toxic substances?</P>
<P>Other interventions such as <I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine and EPO have failed to show any advantage. It is a matter of note that a meta-analysis of studies using Atrial Natriuretic Peptides has shown some benefit of treatment in the form of improved creatinine clearance. However, caution is required in accepting these findings because two large studies conducted by one particular author reported an advantage of NAC over controls and considerably influenced the overall results (<LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2011</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Potential renal damage in participants with pre-existing renal injury is widely recognized (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2006</LINK>). One area of interest for the authors of this review involved looking at the beneficial effects of treatment in participants with pre-existing renal impairment. Fortunately, we were able to include in this updated review 14 studies that considered this topic. These studies used different interventions. Unfortunately, available data are somewhat limited for the purpose of analysis. No difference was noted in reported mortality, but some advantage seems to be associated with treatment intervention, thus avoiding acute renal injury. Note that we have previously discussed differing criteria between studies for the diagnosis of acute renal damage. Urine output seems to improve when interventions are provided for patients with pre-existing renal damage, but the heterogeneity of the studies makes the results less valid.</P>
<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis of 24 studies of high and moderately high methodological quality. The results suggest no benefit for mortality or acute renal damage associated with treatment intervention. A marginal advantage seen in better urine output at 24 hours was offset by high heterogeneity, and no advantage was noted for creatinine clearance at 24 hours. These results substantiate the overall findings on questionable renal protection effects for various interventions given during the perioperative period.</P>
<P>It is important to remember that the effect of ADH is part of the usual stress response of surgery. Both urine output and free water clearance in the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery are reduced because of the influence of ADH (<LINK REF="REF-Brazel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazel 1996</LINK>). Fractional excretion of sodium is increased with the use of diuretics. Hence we would question the worth of measurements of urine output, free water clearance and fractional excretion of sodium as measures of renal function in the perioperative period. Glomerular filtration rate (and creatinine clearance) and renal plasma flow are good measures of renal function, but these must be measured accurately if meaningful conclusions are to be drawn.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A major outcome of interest, mortality, was reported in a number of studies. Only a small number of deaths were reported in the trials, and this review shows that no advantage was conferred by individual interventions. Similarly, another outcome of major importance, acute renal injury after operation, was reported in only a few of the included studies. No evidence suggests that specific interventions offered any advantages for participants. However, it is important to recognize that the methodological quality of many of the included studies was poor and that the number of reported cases was small. Another point to consider is the inconsistency of the criteria used to diagnose renal injury across multiple studies. As a result, the statistical significance may not indicate a true advantage of interventions over no interventions.</P>
<P>In the subgroup of surgical procedures, cardiac surgery, aortic surgery and biliary surgery were considered for analysis. In cardiac surgery, interventions helped to increase urine output at 24 hours after surgery, but a high level of heterogeneity made the results unconvincing. Creatinine clearance also improved slightly at two to three days and five to seven days after surgery with treatment given to participants undergoing cardiac surgery, ,but the results are considerably swayed by the studies conducted by Sezai et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sezai-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sezai 2011</LINK>). None of the other tests showed any significant changes. Reported mortality and acute renal injury were no different after cardiac surgery and after abdominal aortic surgery.</P>
<P>No benefit was noted in other forms of interventions and surgery. However, the number and quality of studies in these areas are limited.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-05 01:04:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Even though we included 72 studies in this review, the overall methodological quality of the studies was poor. The methodological quality assessment identified twelve studies of good quality and another nine studies in which the methodological quality was considered moderately good. Most of the studies that we assessed (51 studies) were classified as showing poor methodological quality. This would reflect on any conclusions drawn from this review.</P>
<P>A note of caution: Many of the studies included in this review are old and were conducted before adaptations were made to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end-stage kidney disease) classification, which was introduced in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2007</LINK>), and to acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis and classification criteria, introduced in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>). These classifications are generally accepted in modern clinical practice and research (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2013</LINK>). So that the reader might find no uniformity or consistency for the diagnosis or classification of renal damage in many of the older studies included in this review; we have taken the criteria and diagnosis used by the authors. Any future update of this review should include a subgroup of studies conforming to such classification as RIFLE or AKI.</P>
<P>Another area of concern was that we were unable to standardize the administration or withholding of various medications, which may or may not have influenced individual study results.</P>

A recent systematic review, undertaken to look at renal protection offered by perioperative haemodynamic manipulation, looks at the effects of haemodynamic stabilization and the effects of inotropes and fluids or a combination of these (<LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>). Although we are reluctant to comment on the methodological rigor of the Brienza review, it is of note that this review agrees with the present review on the use of fluids as a measure to protect renal function, showing no clear advantage for fluid management alone. However, the focus of our review is exploration of the effects of pharmacological agents used in the perioperative period.</P>

<P>No convincing evidence suggests that pharmacological or other interventions used to protect the kidneys during surgery are of benefit to patients, as seen from 72 included studies.

<P>Many studies are available on the use of various pharmaceutical agents to protect renal function during surgery. Further areas of possible research might include the use of newer methods of identifying acute renal damage, such as urinary biomarkers. Future studies should focus on evaluation of preventive measures or more precise and accurate methods of identifying the benefit or harm of interventions. Use of RIFLE or AKI classification to identify renal damage would result in better comparisons of the effects of interventions and procedures.</P>

<P>We have included new interventions in this review (<I>N</I>-acetyl cysteine, atrial natriuretic peptide, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin). We have looked at some of the newer biomarkers of kidney damage (urinary NAG/creatinine ratio; urinary RBP/creatinine ratio; plasma cystatin C; urinary NGAL/creatinine ratio) as surrogate markers for renal damage.</P>
