<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-17 11:07:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic surgical ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the management of the preterm infants.<BR/>
<BR/>The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that is open during fetal life and connects blood flow from the vessel that supplies blood to the lungs to the major vessel that supplies blood to the body (the aorta). This blood vessel can stay open after birth leading to a condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is one of the most common cardiac conditions in babies who are born very early (premature) and can lead to significant complications and death. Prophylactic (very early) closure of the ductus arteriosus (within 72 hours after birth) can be achieved medically or surgically. Llittle is known about the effectiveness and safety of very early surgical closure (ligation). The review found that surgical ligation in preterm infants reduced the risk of severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a gastrointestinal disease that mostly affects premature infants involving infection and inflammation of the bowel (intestine); however, early surgical ligation did not decrease the risk of death, chronic lung disease and other major complications of preterm infants. In view of the lack of significant benefit and growing data suggesting the potential harm of such treatment modality, current evidence does not support the use of early surgical ligation of PDA in the management of preterm infants.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-04-24 21:53:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized or quazi-randomised controlled trials that enrolled infants &#8804; 28 weeks gestation or &#8804; 1000 g at birth who were on assisted ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen without clinical signs of hemodynamic significant PDA were considered.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-24 21:35:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one eligible study that enrolled 84 ELBW infants was identified. Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA resulted in a statistically significant reduction of severe stage II or III necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [RR 0.25, 95% CI (0.08,0.83), p value 0.02, NNT 5]. The study found no statistically significant difference in mortality, severe grade III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), BPD, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA did not decrease mortality or BPD in ELBW infants. A significant reduction of stage II or III NEC was noted. Based on the current evidence, the high rate of spontaneous closure, availability of effective safe medical therapies, and the potential short and long-term complications of surgical ligation, the use such prophylactic surgical therapy is not indicated in the management of the preterm infants. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-11 11:47:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiac condition among preterm infants. It affects approximately 40 to 55% of preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks gestation and/or weighing under 1500 g at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Reller-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reller 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trus 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzinho-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzinho 1991</LINK>). In spite of significant advances in neonatal care over the last two decades, the approach to PDA management remains one of the most controversial topics in neonatal medicine.</P>
<P>PDA remains hemodynamically significant in preterm infants for a variety of reasons including decreased ductal sensitivity to the partial pressure of oxygen, increased circulating prostaglandin E2, and increased ductal tissue sensitivity to prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1995</LINK>). A hemodynamically significant PDA is associated with left to right shunting of systemic blood with subsequent pulmonary overcirculation and a diastolic steal that results in hypoperfusion of vital organs. In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, symptomatic PDA increases the risk of prolonged ventilation and oxygen requirements, pulmonary hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 2003</LINK>). The diastolic steal is associated with renal hypoperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 1995</LINK>), intestinal ischemia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), reduced middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nestrud-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nestrud 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shimada-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimada 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1999</LINK>), and decreased superior vena cava (SVC) flow with concurrent increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (<LINK REF="REF-Duddell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duddell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2003</LINK> ). If not managed appropriately, complications of symptomatic PDA may lead to death (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1979</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-04-24 21:38:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The increased number of surviving preterm infants has led to a higher number of infants requiring medical or surgical intervention for the PDA . Standard therapies include fluid restriction and use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin or ibuprofen. Surgical ligation is used when medical treatment fails or is contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitterman-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitterman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1984</LINK>). There is no consensus as to what is the best time of treatment and the optimal management strategy among this high-risk vulnerable population.</P>
<P>Prophylactic indomethacin has been shown to have favorable intermediate outcomes, such as reductions in the risk of significant PDA, the need for surgical ligation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>), and pulmonary hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-AlFaleh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AlFaleh 2004</LINK>). Prophylactic indomethacin has not been shown to alter long-term outcomes including the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months of corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>). Given the limitation of medical treatment, prophylactic surgical closure of the PDA may be a reasonable alternative in a high-risk population, since it results in ultimate ductal closure and, therefore, might prevent associated neonatal morbidities.</P>
<P>Routine surgical ligation of a PDA refractory to medical treatment is widely practiced (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pokharel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokharel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satur-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satur 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>). However, there is no clear evidence that surgical ligation of a hemodynamically significant PDA is associated with improved long-term outcomes in preterm infants. Furthermore, surgery may potentially result in significant morbidities such as pneumothorax, hypothermia, intra-operative bleeding, phrenic nerve palsy, wound infection, vocal cord palsy and thoracic scoliosis. On the other hand, there are reports suggesting that surgical ligation may be the preferred first line of treatment when compared to indomethacin in preterm infants less than 800 g (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trus 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Even though there may be a general consensus with respect to the use of indomethacin as the initial therapy for a symptomatic PDA while reserving surgical ligation for indomethacin failures, this therapeutic approach may not represent the optimal management of PDA in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW), the population at greatest risk for PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Malviya--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malviya 2003</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-11 12:15:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Group were used to assess the methodological quality (validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, information was sought regarding the method of randomization, blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. Each criteria was assessed as yes, no, can't tell. This information was entered in the table "Characteristics of Included Studies".</P>
<P>For the updated review in 2010, the Risk of Bias table was completed. The two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>The Risk of Bias table addressed the following questions:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); inadequate (any nonrandom process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or unclear.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or unclear.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.

<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

<P>Initial electronic search using OVID MEDLINE and EMBASE yielded 106 MEDLINE and 86 EMBASE potentially relevant citations. After reading abstracts, two articles were identified as potentially relevant. Review of full text articles identified one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cassady-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cassady 1989</LINK>) investigating the use of prophylactic PDA surgical ligation in preterm infants. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cotton-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Cotton 1978</LINK>) was excluded for reasons outlined in the table "Characteristics of Excluded Studies". There was total agreement among both review authors with regard to the search process. Details of the included study is shown in the table "Characteristics of Included Studies".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cassady-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cassady 1989</LINK> was a single center randomised controlled trial. Eighty-four preterm infants less than 1000 g were enrolled in both study arms. The surgical intervention group (n = 40) had a PDA ligation within 24 hours of life following a pre-specified protocol while the control group (n = 44) received standard care defined as:<BR/>1) nasal CPAP initially for hypoxemia due to RDS or pulmonary edema;<BR/>2) endotracheal intubation and ventilation for respiratory failure (PCo2 &gt; 70) or refractory apnea;<BR/>3) bedside Echo and radionuclide studies routinely performed to detect "silent" ducts.</P>
<P>Ligation was performed for hemodynamically significant ducts based on predefined criteria. Neither group received any cyclooxygenase inhibitor during or before the study period. Infants with echo defined criteria or hemodynamically significant PDA underwent subsequent surgical ligation. The main outcome measures were survival to one year after birth, NEC (Bell's stage III, IV), IVH defined by cranial ultrasound, BPD and ROP. Long-term neurosensory outcomes were not assessed. The study was suspended after 14 months since only few physicians were available to conduct the study properly.</P>

<P>Cassady et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cassady-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cassady 1989</LINK>) was a single center study. Two groups of 84 infants were randomised to receive either early prophylactic surgical PDA ligation (within 24 hours of birth) or control (no intervention). Randomization was possibly adequate and allocation was adequately concealed. The intervention was not blinded. Measurement of outcomes was blinded for NEC and BPD. Blinding of other outcomes was not clear. All randomised infants were accounted for in the analysis. Of note, the sample size of this study was calculated to detect a large difference of 50%, which rendered the study underpowered to detect smaller meaningful clinical differences among the study groups.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cassady-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cassady 1989</LINK>) that compared the effect of early prophylactic PDA ligation in extreme low birth weight infants versus later or no intervention was eligible for inclusion in this review. Prophylactic surgical ligation of the duct resulted in no significant differences in mortality, IVH, BPD and ROP between the two study groups. Interestingly, the study was able to show a significant reduction of severe NEC in the prophylactic surgical group as compared to infants who received selective treatment for hemodynamically significant PDA (20% vs. 79%). While it is possible this is a result of a true effect, it is important to note that feeds were introduced earlier in the control group. Strong conclusions can not be made since the study is underpowered to detect minimally important clinical differences in outcomes other than NEC.</P>
<P>Ligation of the ductus arteriosus is not without risks and it is often associated with significant hypotension and postoperative cardiorespiratory instability secondary to cardiovascular physiologic adaptation. There is limited information on the ability of preterm infants to compensate for the dramatic changes in left ventricular afterload following ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Teixeira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teixeira 2006</LINK>). Surgical ligation also poses risks of potential morbidity from infection, pneumothorax, chylothorax and vocal cord paralysis. Surgical ligation may not be easily accessible to all centers. In addition, evidence is accumulating regarding PDA ligation and its association with a higher incidence of BPD, ROP and unfavorable neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the publication of the included trial, the practice of neonatal medicine has advanced significantly. Over the last 16 years, many trials were published addressing the efficacy of prophylactic cyclooxygenase inhibitors (i.e. indomethacin and ibuprofen) in reducing the incidence of PDA and other short and long-term morbidities in ELBW infants. The use of prophylactic indomethacin reduces the incidence of PDA by more than 50%, surgical ligation of the duct by 50% and severe grade III and IV IVH by 35% with no apparent adverse effect in long-term neurosensory outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>). With the high rate of spontaneous closure, availability of effective safe medical therapies, potential short and long-term complications of prophylactic surgical ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2007</LINK>), and the recent doubts raised concerning the need to close all significant PDA's in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Laughon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laughon 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Laughon--2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laughon 2007</LINK>), there is no obvious role for prophylactic surgical ligation in the management of preterm infants.</P>
<P>Current evidence demonstrates that prophylactic indomethacin given to preterm infants reduces the incidence of symptomatic PDA, severe IVH, and serious pulmonary hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AlFaleh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AlFaleh 2004</LINK>) . Despite the reduction of the aforementioned morbidities (all of which are associated with poor long-term outcome), no improvements in long-term neurosensory outcome was noted. Giving indomethacin to unselected group of infants, irrespective of the ductal size, is a possible explanation (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-DA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn DA 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested that future studies aimed at preventing IVH and improving neurodevelopmental outcome using medical agents to close the PDA should be directed at infants with large, hemodynamically significant PDA in the first hours of life (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-DA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn DA 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The conclusions of our review are weakened by the inclusion of only one, small trial that addressed the intervention under study. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-24 21:52:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA did not decrease mortality or the incidence of BPD in ELBW infants. A significant reduction in the incidence of stage II or III NEC was noted. Based on the current evidence, the high rate of spontaneous closure, availability of effective and safe medical therapies, and the potential short and long-term complications of surgical ligation, the use such prophylactic surgical therapy is not indicated in the management of the preterm infants. </P>
