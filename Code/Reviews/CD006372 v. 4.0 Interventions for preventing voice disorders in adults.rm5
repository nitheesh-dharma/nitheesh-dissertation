<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-28 12:12:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People in occupations where voice use is central, such as teachers, are more at risk of developing voice disorders. The definition of voice disorders and their possible causes as well as the best methods for preventing them are still being debated. There is also no consensus on the best method of evaluating the voice, although many consider auditory voice quality assessment (where an expert judge listens to a recording of a participant's voice and makes his or her own judgment of its level of abnormality) as a gold standard measure. Voice training is used to prevent voice disorders. Voice training usually consists of a combination of 'direct' and 'indirect' treatment techniques. Direct techniques focus on the underlying physiological changes needed to improve an individual's technique in using the vocal system and may aim to alter vocal fold closure (adduction), respiratory patterns or resonance, pitch or articulatory tension. In practice this means training about how to achieve correct posture, breathing techniques and making various sounds like humming, singing musical scales or yawning. Indirect techniques, on the other hand, concentrate on contributory and maintenance aspects of the voice disorder and may involve relaxation strategies, counselling, explanation of the normal anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract, explanation of the causal factors of voice disorders and voice care and conservation.</P>
<P>We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing voice disorders in adults. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and combined their results. We found six studies which met our inclusion criteria. Four were conducted with teachers, one with student teachers and one with telemarketers.</P>
<P>We found no evidence that either direct or indirect voice training nor the two combined are effective in improving vocal functioning when measured using self-reported outcomes and when compared to no intervention.</P>
<P>All the included studies were small and of low methodological quality. Given the extent of the problem and the widespread use of voice training, further research is warranted.</P>

<P>We identified six randomised controlled trials including a total of 262 participants. Four studies were conducted with primary school or kindergarten teachers, one with student teachers and one with telemarketers. </P>
<P>Three studies found similar self-reported vocal symptoms between those who attended direct voice training and those who were in a no intervention control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.27; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.66).</P>
<P>Two studies found similar self-reported vocal symptoms between those who attended indirect voice training and those who were in a no intervention control group (SMD 0.44; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.92).</P>
<P>One study found similar scores on the Voice Handicap Index for those who had direct and indirect voice training combined and for those who had no intervention. Two studies compared a combination of direct and indirect voice training with indirect voice training only. Both studies found similar scores for self-reported phonation difficulty (mean difference -5.55; 95% CI -23.75 to 12.66) in both groups.</P>
<P>The evidence for all comparisons was rated as low quality.</P>
<P>No work-directed studies were found. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of prevention in terms of sick leave or number of diagnosed voice disorders.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no evidence that either direct or indirect voice training or the two combined are effective in improving self-reported vocal functioning when compared to no intervention. The current practice of giving training to at-risk populations for preventing the development of voice disorders is therefore not supported by definitive evidence of effectiveness. Larger and methodologically better trials are needed with outcome measures that better reflect the aims of interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-19 13:59:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2007.</P>
<P>In modern society, there is an increasing demand for oral communication in many occupations<I>. </I>It has been estimated that a well-functioning voice is essential to one-third of the labour force (<LINK REF="REF-Laukkanen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laukkanen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdolini-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdolini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, it has been argued that the use of the voice in various professional and social contexts is constantly growing (<LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 2000b</LINK>), due to the prevalence of new speech technology applications, such as mobile phones.</P>
<P>People who use their voice as a main tool in their work, i.e. professional voice users, often suffer from voice symptoms to a varying extent (<LINK REF="REF-Fritzell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritzell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scherer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Titze-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1997</LINK>). Teachers have been found to be the largest occupational group among those seeking medical help for voice problems (<LINK REF="REF-Fritzell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritzell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herrington_x002d_Hall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrington-Hall 1988</LINK>). Between 20% to 80% of teachers have reported suffering from various voice symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Sala-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>). These studies have investigated voice symptoms rather than cases in which specific voice disorders have been diagnosed. The risk factors in voice-utilising professions include background noise, poor room acoustics, long speaking distance, poor quality of air (dryness, dust), poor working posture and vocal loading itself from speaking or singing (<LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 1996</LINK>). Vocal load is measured in terms of time and intensity: the longer and louder a person has to talk, the greater the strain on the voice will be and the more vocal capacity is required (<LINK REF="REF-Buekers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buekers 1998</LINK>). Pre-professional voice training can be advantageous for future occupational voice users, but it is often insufficiently organised and, as a result, fails to prevent voice problems (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 2000a</LINK>). The educational programmes for singers and actors who are required to have a high quality of voice in their occupation include voice training. Other professionals also exposed to high vocal loading (teachers, salespersons, military, clergy), however, are only occasionally provided with training and usually on the worker's own initiative. For example, many teachers regard their vocal symptoms as inherent to their occupation and do not necessarily take appropriate countermeasures (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Voice quality is a continuum between normal and abnormal extremes, which is why the differentiation of a disordered voice from a normal one is complicated. A person may produce a hoarse voice without any sign of abnormality in the larynx. On the other hand, people with certain laryngeal pathologies do not necessarily reveal appreciable vocal disturbances until a considerably advanced stage (<LINK REF="REF-Treole-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treole 1997</LINK>). In this review we consider people with voice problems or symptoms as not having a voice disorder until they have been identified/diagnosed as such by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or a speech-language pathologist (SLP). In the literature voice fatigue, voice symptoms, voice problems and voice disorders are all terms used when studying occupational voice and its loading. Vocal loading is a combination of prolonged voice use and "additional loading factors (e.g. background noise, acoustics, air quality) affecting the fundamental frequency, type and loudness of phonation or the vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds as well as the external frame of the larynx" (<LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 2004</LINK>). There is usually no direct dose-response relationship between vocal loading and self-perceived voice problems as the threshold for seeking clinical help varies greatly between individuals. In this situation, prevention programmes that share knowledge or skills can help in preserving and improving the voice. However, when people suffering from voice problems seek clinical help for them, they are often diagnosed as having a voice disorder. Hence, instead of prevention they are offered voice therapy. Having a voice disorder always implies that voice symptoms are experienced as problems, but experiencing symptoms does not always mean that a person has a voice disorder. Usually the reported voice problems include self-perceived voice symptoms and reductions in physical, social, emotional or professional well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Verdolini-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdolini 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been stated that "in general, the goal of voice care, both prevention and treatment, is to restore the best voice possible, a voice that will be functional for purposes of employment and general communication" (<LINK REF="REF-Colton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 2006</LINK>). The educational approach can help individuals to identify factors that may contribute to a voice problem, alter and avoid them, and modify vocal behaviour before any damage occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2003</LINK>). Early identification of voice problems is also likely to reduce their severity and the time needed for recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1998</LINK>). Proper care of the voice also plays a key role in restoring and preserving the individual's occupational capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Ramig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramig 1998</LINK>). Interventions directed toward preventing voice disorders can be divided into person-directed interventions (e.g. voice training) and work- or environment-directed interventions (e.g. ergonomic consultation/education and improving the acoustic conditions of the workplace).</P>
<P>We have defined prevention programmes as interventions which are offered to people at risk of voice disorders. In this review we chose self-reported measures of voice handicap (participation restrictions), voice symptoms and voice-related quality of life as primary indicators of the effectiveness of prevention activities. This is because of the variation between individuals in how a particular voice disturbance is perceived to affect their communication or ability to fulfil social and occupational responsibilities. All other measures of vocal or laryngeal performance are considered as secondary outcomes, along with measures of sickness absence and return to work.</P>
<P>Studies of the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for treating diagnosed voice disorders have also been conducted. They have been dealt with in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Ruotsalainen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruotsalainen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included studies in which the participants were adults (16 or over), who due to their occupation, studies, hobby or lifestyle were at risk of developing a voice disorder but had not yet been identified/diagnosed as having one by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or a speech-language pathologist (SLP). The voice changes throughout life. In childhood the morphology of vocal fold tissues keeps changing and during puberty the larynx grows (<LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>).The three connective tissue layers of the lamina propria, despite being apparent already during puberty, continue to become more differentiated until the age of 16 or 17 (<LINK REF="REF-Colton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 2006</LINK>). In advanced age some age-related changes (e.g. ossification, atrophy, dystrophy and oedema) affect phonation (<LINK REF="REF-Jasper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasper 2000</LINK>). However, it is the physiological rather than the chronological age which has a strong impact on how well the larynx functions in phonation (<LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>). In this study we considered participants older than 16 years as adults.</P>

<P>We searched the literature for evaluation studies of interventions for functional voice disorders without restrictions on language or publication. Systematic search strategies were developed together with the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Search Co-ordinator and the Cochrane Occupational Health Field Information Specialist.</P>
<P>For the original version of this review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (PubMed, 1950 to March 2006), EMBASE (embase.com, 1974 to March 2006), CINAHL (OVID, 1983 to March 2006), PsycINFO (webSPIRS, 1967 to February 2006), Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science, Thomson, 1986 to March 2006) and the Occupational Health databases OSH-ROM (webSPIRS, to February 2006). The search string for randomised controlled trials is based on <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK> and the string for non-randomised studies on <LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2005</LINK>. Since the opportunities for naming and classifying voice disorders and their various treatments are so abundant, the searches were developed with the aim of maximum sensitivity at the expense of specificity.

<P>The results of each trial were plotted as means and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes and as odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes. In contrast to the previous version of the review, we also used standardised mean differences to be able to pool studies with similar outcomes measured with different scales. We felt that increasing power by combining small studies with non-significant findings was important even though we know that standardised mean differences are more difficult for clinicians to interpret. We used the general assumption that an effect size of 0.2 indicates a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 and beyond a big effect.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-06-16 11:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where necessary, we sought missing statistical data (means and standard deviations) from trial authors. Since all studies had outcomes using continuous data, we were unable to conduct an intention-to-treat analysis. Results for the <LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK> study were calculated from the raw patient data provided in the article because the reported figures were based on log-transformed data. <LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK> reported the scores separately for each participant. We then calculated means and standard deviations based on the reported data. Results for the <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009</LINK> study were calculated from raw data obtained from the author because the voice symptom scores in the article were reported separately for men and women and they did not include standard deviations. In addition to the results of the voice symptom questionnaire, <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009</LINK> also reported the same data as symptoms being absent or present and as improvement, worsening or no change. We did not use these data. The results for the <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK> study were obtained from the authors because they reported their results only in figures. This data set also contained the results for the self-reported outcomes used in the <LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK> study and so we used the results data obtained from the authors and not those presented in this article.

<P>For interventions directed at individuals, we used only randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions.

<P>The decision as to whether to perform quantitative pooling was based on clinical homogeneity. We defined clinically homogeneous studies as those with similar populations, interventions and outcomes measured at the same follow-up point. The main problem in combining studies was the use of various outcome measures. We judged the Voice Handicap Index, vocal symptom score and questionnaire of vocal symptoms to be conceptually sufficiently similar to allow us to pool the results using standardised mean differences as implemented in the RevMan 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>The original systematic searches yielded a set of 5937 references. From these, we identified a set of 46 potentially eligible studies based on title and abstract. These were then scrutinised further with regard to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Altogether we excluded 44 studies leaving a total of two studies. The updated search strategies in March 2010 yielded a new set of 1696 references. From these, we identified a set of 48 potentially eligible studies. We then scrutinised the full-text articles further with regard to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Altogether we excluded 47 studies leaving a total of four new studies, out of which two publications (<LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK>) reported results based on overlapping samples. However, since the two studies reported on two different comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK>: voice training and voice hygiene lecture versus voice hygiene lecture alone; <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK>: Voice Massage(TM) and voice hygiene lecture versus voice hygiene lecture alone) they are treated here as two separate studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>We found the following types of interventions:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Direct voice training</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Pasa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pasa 2007</LINK>) evaluated the effectiveness of training using direct intervention techniques alone compared to no intervention. In general, direct techniques focus on the underlying physiological changes needed to improve an individual's technique in using the vocal system. In <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004</LINK> this consisted of training focused on posture, respiration, release of tension in the vocal apparatus, resonance and voice projection. The authors do not provide any details regarding the type, length or frequency of vocal exercises. In <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009</LINK> direct voice training consisted of vocal warm-up and cool-down as well as group activities regarding the psychodynamics of voice production. In order to promote vocal warm-up, facilitating sounds, body movement techniques with sound production, overarticulation exercises, semi-occluded vocal tract exercises (hand-over-mouth technique) and chant talk exercises were used in eight 30-minute modules offered weekly. The facilitating sounds included humming sounds associated with chewing movements, fricatives and voice sounds associated with ascending musical scales (from C3 to C4) in staccato and legato. For cool-down, voice sounds were also used, with descending musical scales (from G3 to C3), as well as the yawn-sigh technique and laryngeal manipulation. In <LINK REF="STD-Pasa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pasa 2007</LINK> direct voice training consisted of warm-up, stretching, contracting, and adductory strengthening exercises to be practised at home, twice each, twice per day, preferably morning and evening, for a six-week period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Indirect voice training</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Pasa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pasa 2007</LINK>) looked at indirect voice training alone compared to no intervention. Indirect techniques concentrate on the contributory and maintenance aspects of the voice disorder (such as lack of knowledge). In <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004</LINK> this consisted of providing information on the mechanics of voice production, the amount and type of voice use, vocal behaviours thought to be phonotraumatic, hydration issues and lifestyle and diet factors that can support or interfere with a healthy voice. In <LINK REF="STD-Pasa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pasa 2007</LINK> participants were informed of the prevalence and impact of voice problems in teachers, basic anatomy and physiology of voice production, symptoms of voice disorders, strategies to reduce harmful vocal behaviours, managing and minimising health factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of voice problems, and changes to the speaking environment that increase vocal efficiency and reduce vocal harm. The training consisted of one two-hour group session and three 30-minute group sessions over ten weeks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Direct and indirect voice training combined</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK>) looked at direct and indirect voice training combined. In <LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK> the intervention consisted of lectures and a practical session. The lecture concerned the anatomy and physiology of phonation, the causes of and predisposing factors to abnormal vocal fold pathology, the warning symptoms of vocal fatigue, voice ergonomics (i.e. vocal hygiene, strategies to reduce vocal demand in the classroom, and changing behaviour in daily life to reduce vocal abuse), classroom acoustics, and amplification systems. The practical session consisted of group voice therapy training: efficient respiratory behaviour; laryngeal muscle relaxation; manual circumlaryngeal therapy; relaxed voicing with elimination of hard glottal attack, chewing, voicing, yawn-sigh, chant talk and pitch inflections; proper oral-nasal resonance; and developing greater oral opening. The course had a duration of seven hours and consisted of two theoretical lectures each 90 minutes long and two sessions of group voice therapy each of 120 minutes. In <LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK> the intervention consisted of a three-hour lecture and five one-hour voice training lessons during nine weeks. The lecture concerned the basics of voice and speech production, the main factors causing vocal loading in teachers, methods available to avoid overloading, and basics of economic versus non-economic voice use. The voice training course was geared towards gaining ease and endurance in voice production, and getting rid of any poor vocal habits. The learning methods were introspections, discussions, voice exercises and individualised homework with a view to finding economic voice production, i.e. avoidance of excessive muscle tension of the larynx, deep breathing technique, firmness of phonation without effort, well-resonating voice quality to improve audibility, and adequate individual pitch and loudness range and variation. In <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK> another randomly chosen group of 30 participants was added to the sample used in <LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK>. These participants also received the three-hour voice hygiene lecture and in addition they were given Voice Massage(TM) in five one-hour sessions over a period of 11 weeks. Voice Massage(TM) consists of manipulation of voice and speech production muscles of the larynx, respiration and articulation. It also includes some vocal and respiratory exercises during manipulation.</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK>) used the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1999</LINK>). The VHI is a 30-item five-point Likert scale which assigns a number to how frequently the responder experiences particular problems described in the statements, with 0 = never and 4 = frequently. The scores have a potential range from 0 to 120 with the higher score correlating with a greater impact.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2004</LINK>) used the Vocology Screening Profile (<LINK REF="REF-Hazlett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazlett 2001</LINK>). This 18-item questionnaire measures the frequency of the occurrence of vocal symptoms with a five-point Likert scale, with 0 = never and 4 = frequently. The range of potential scores is 0 to 72.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pasa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pasa 2007</LINK>) used the vocal use patterns at work questionnaire (13 items) and the vocal capabilities questionnaire (17 items). The former required participants to indicate how often they used particular negative vocal behaviours at work (e.g. throat clearing and shouting over large distances) by rating on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from "never" to "every time I use my voice" for every question. The results were reported as mean sums of ratings on a scale from 0 (no vocal misuse) to 1300 (greatest amount of vocal misuse). The latter questionnaire aimed to identify the extent to which participants experienced vocal symptoms associated with throat discomfort, breath control, pitch, loudness, voice quality and projection. For every question the participants rated their perception of their vocal abilities on a 100 mm VAS that ranged from "never" to "every time I use my voice". The results were reported as mean sums of ratings on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 1700 (most severe symptoms).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Laukkanen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laukkanen 2009</LINK>) used three visual analogue scales for subjective evaluations: mean phonation difficulty (0 = particularly easy voice production; 100 = ordinary voice production; 200 = very difficult voice production), mean voice quality (0 = very good; 100 = ordinary quality; 200 = very poor quality) and mean throat tiredness (0 = no tiredness at all; 100 = very tired).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009</LINK>) used the questionnaire of vocal symptoms<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Lehto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehto 2003</LINK>) which is composed of 11 items. Responses to these items are given on a four-point scale including: 1 = not even once a year or never, 2 = a few times a year or sometimes, 3 = approximately once a month or quite often, and 4 = almost every week or very often. The questionnaire results in composite scores that add up the individual scores for each item.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2009</LINK> also used an adapted version of a questionnaire originally used by <LINK REF="STD-Lehto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehto 2003</LINK> and named it the Benefits Obtained with Vocal Training (BVT) questionnaire.<I> </I>Of the 23 items in this questionnaire 11 were selected for use in this study. Two items were also added: "With the training my voice became clearer than before" and "With the training my voice became more resistant to fatigue than before". The adapted BVT questionnaire was scored: 1 = disagree, 2 = neither agree nor disagree, 3 = somewhat agree and 4 = agree. Items scored 3 or 4 were considered agreement. Results were reported as percentages of agreement to the 13 items of the questionnaire.</P>

Voice quality was assessed with a unipolar scale: 0 = very poor quality and 1000 = very good quality. Firmness of phonation was assessed with a bipolar scale: 0 = breathy phonation, 500 adequate firmness, and 1000 = strained voice.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-20 09:03:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we did not find evidence for the effectiveness of direct or indirect voice training nor the two combined in improving vocal functioning when compared to no intervention as measured with any patient-reported primary outcome measure. However, the 95% confidence intervals included appreciable effects especially in favour of the no intervention group. In terms of secondary outcomes, direct and indirect voice training combined was effective in increasing maximum phonation time and decreasing shimmer in two separate studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-16 10:41:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The significant result of an increase in maximum phonation time found in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bovo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bovo 2007</LINK>) is an indication of compliance with the intervention as the phonation time increased by 30% in the intervention group and not in the control group. However, the baseline values were well below average and therefore the clinical relevance of this finding is probably low (cf. <LINK REF="REF-Raes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raes 1996</LINK>). The small decrease in shimmer found in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Ilom_x00e4_ki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ilomäki 2008</LINK>) is also of questionable importance. A measurement of shimmer (dB) is an evaluation of the cycle to cycle variability of the amplitude of vocal fold vibration within the analysed voice sample. Lower or decreased values therefore suggest a better ability to maintain periodicity in vocal fold vibration. As the normal human voice is only quasiperiodic, any voice sample will contain some short-term variability in both amplitude (i.e. shimmer) and pitch (i.e. jitter). Average values of shimmer for women without voice problems have been measured, in a range of studies, as lying somewhere between 0.24 dB and 0.48 dB when measured with the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (<LINK REF="REF-Kent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kent 2003</LINK>). According to the authors there are no normative data for the Intelligent Speech Analyser(TM) used in their study. Therefore it is difficult to say whether the measured 0.119 dB decrease from 0.486 dB to 0.367 dB in mean shimmer has any clinical relevance.</P>
<P>Objective measurements such as videolaryngoscopy, acoustical analysis (frequency, intensity and perturbation measures), maximum phonation time, etc. have also yet to yield recommendations for the ranges of a healthy voice, because the voice and its quality is a continuum unique to each person. Indirect measures, such as voice failures leading to sick leave or the number of diagnosed voice disorders, appear not to be used at all as measures of effectiveness.</P>
<P>The finding that participants tend to report more symptoms or increased voice handicap following intervention could be due to an increased awareness of the symptoms and is probably not due to a real increase in symptoms or handicap.</P>
<P>Apparently the effectiveness of voice training in preventing voice disorders has not been studied extensively, since we found so few randomised controlled trials despite our very extensive search strategy. Our search strategy was also designed to find non-randomised studies and in so doing we made sure that we did not overlook any other relevant evidence. An overview of published non-randomised controlled trials of person-directed interventions for the prevention of voice problems is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. According to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hackworth-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hackworth 2007</LINK>) indirect voice training only compared with indirect voice training and additional information on behavioral modification/teaching techniques did not result in significant differences in vocal problems, water consumption, minutes of daily vocal warm up, number of vocal breaks taken, talking over noise or the use of non-verbal commands. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Timmermans-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Timmermans 2004b</LINK>) compared direct and indirect voice training combined and no intervention and found that the groups scored similarly on the Voice Handicap Index. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1994</LINK>) found that direct and indirect voice training combined was effective in reducing Relative Average Perturbation when compared to no intervention. The results seem similar to the findings of our review, but they are difficult to compare because non-randomised studies are more prone to bias. However, the non-randomised studies do indicate that we did not overlook results that would put the review in a totally different perspective.</P>
<P>Possible reasons for not succeeding in finding a significant positive prevention effect could be inadequacies in the duration of the training (the length in time and amount of the sessions) or in the formulation of the contents of the training. The results we found do not support the current practice of giving training to at-risk populations for preventing the development of voice disorders. A clinically more relevant outcome would be the number of teachers that report having a current voice problem, such as in <LINK REF="REF-Roy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2004</LINK>. We can take the figure of 11% for current voice problems from that study as an indication of the incidence of voice problems among teachers even though the real incidence would probably be lower. If we assume that training would be able to reduce voice problems by a quarter to 8%, then we would need about 1500 study participants for a sufficiently powered study.</P>
<P>We defined self-reported measures of voice handicap or symptoms as our primary outcome, because this is the clinical problem that is most relevant to patients. For example the Voice Handicap Index (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1999</LINK>) estimates the psychosocial handicap caused by an already existing voice problem or disorder and it is a frequently used and validated questionnaire. However, it is difficult to say what constitutes a clinically relevant result in prevention studies since any decrease in voice handicap could be relevant at the population level. Since we do not have a clinical case definition or cut-off point beyond which we can speak of dysphonia cases it is not possible to say how many cases have been prevented.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-20 09:09:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of all included studies was poor. Even though all included studies were randomised controlled trials they were small and none of them reported the method of randomisation used or whether the process was concealed. It was also difficult to get a good impression of the concealment of allocation to researchers. We assumed that outcomes that were measured by questionnaire were reported blind to the researchers but we could not be certain about this assumption. Most studies suffered losses to follow up but took no action to deal with the attrition. The reporting of the studies was also of low quality, which is reflected in our having to contact the authors for further information.</P>
<P>The follow-up time after the intervention was 10 months in one trial, one school term in one trial and three months in another. The last measurement time was directly after the intervention in the remaining three trials. In terms of long-term prevention of voice disorders three months is a rather short follow-up time.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-06-16 10:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The negative results of our review cannot be explained by language bias because we applied no language restrictions to the systematic search strategy. It is unlikely that colleagues who determined study inclusion for non-English articles misunderstood their instructions and thereby excluded acceptable randomised trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-06-16 10:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent systematic review about preventative voice training (<LINK REF="REF-Hazlett-_x0028_In-Press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazlett (In Press)</LINK>) concluded that: "voice training may be beneficial for professional voice users". This was, however, based on the conclusions of the authors of the included articles and not on a synthesis of the available evidence. The final conclusion of the authors was that evidence of preventative training still remains inconclusive because of methodological limitations of the included studies. This concurs partially with the conclusions of our review where we conclude that there is no evidence for effectiveness.</P>
<P>It is also noteworthy that we did not find any studies of work-directed or environmental interventions that satisfied our inclusion criteria even though it is clear that a voice handicap develops as a result of the interaction between environmental factors and voice quality or vocal functioning. For this reason the improvement of environmental factors could be a fruitful preventive strategy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-20 09:11:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is clear that larger and methodologically better trials are needed to establish whether the development of voice disorders can be prevented effectively and efficiently. In terms of study design this means comparing two groups of participants with high vocal load, one of which is not given the preventive training. The ethical dilemma thus produced can be overcome by employing a delayed treatment control or offering a minimal intervention to the control group. A randomised design is feasible and should be used to prevent bias. The follow-up time should be at least one year but preferably longer to establish a long-term effect. In addition to a reduction in self-reported symptoms on validated questionnaires, it should also be noted whether participants go on to develop dysphonia. The varying use of terminology should be addressed by seeking consensus regarding meaning and usage.</P>

<P>1) Direct and indirect voice training (21)<BR/>The intervention consisted of a course, an educational pamphlet and exercises to be conducted at home. The course had a duration of 12 hours and consisted of 2 theoretical lectures each 90 minutes long and 2 sessions of group voice therapy each of 120 minutes. The lectures were conducted by two MD phoniatricians (the first 2 authors) and covered the following topics: anatomy and physiology of phonation, the causes and predisposing factors of vocal pathology, the warning symptoms of vocal fatigue, voice ergonomics (i.e. vocal hygiene, strategies to reduce vocal demand in the classroom, and changing behaviour in daily life to reduce vocal abuse), classroom acoustics and amplification systems. The practical session consisted of group voice therapy held by 4 speech-language pathologists (SLP) with at least 15 years experience. During the voice therapy sessions, the participants were divided into groups of 20. The same techniques, as given below, were used by all SLPs and selected according to familiarity: (1) training of efficient respiratory behaviour through utilisation of low abdominal-diaphragmatic breathing; (2) training of laryngeal muscle relaxation using Jacobson-based whole-body relaxation techniques; (3) manual circumlaryngeal therapy; (4) relaxed voicing with elimination of hard glottal attacks, chewing voicing, yawn-sigh, chant talk and pitch inflections; (5) proper oral-nasal resonance (Lessac-based resonance therapy); and (6) exercises for developing greater oral opening.</P>

The learning methods were introspections, discussions, voice exercises and individualised homework with a view to finding economic voice production, i.e. avoidance of excessive muscle tension of the larynx, deep breathing technique, firmness of phonation without effort, well-resonating voice quality to improve audibility, and adequate individual pitch and loudness range and variation.<BR/>

In order to promote vocal warm-up, facilitating sounds, body movement techniques with sound production, overarticulation exercises, semi-occluded vocal tract exercises (hand-over-mouth technique) and chant talk exercises were used in 8 30-minute modules offered weekly. The facilitating sounds included humming sounds associated with chewing movements, fricatives and voice sounds associated with ascending musical scales (from C3 to C4) in staccato and legato. For cool-down, voice sounds were also used, with descending musical scales (from G3 to C3), as well as the yawn-sigh technique and laryngeal manipulation.</P>

<P>1) Direct voice training (10)<BR/>The exercises taught to the participants in this study were a modified version of Stemple's VFE. The VFE training the teachers received consisted of 4 exercises (warm-up, stretching, contracting, and adductory strengthening exercises to be practiced at home, twice each, twice per day, preferably morning and evening, for a 6-week period. The training session began with a brief discussion about the impact and prevalence of voice problems in teachers, and information about how the normal voice works. The participants in VFE group were then instructed how to perform VFE and how often the exercises need to be performed. The participants were encouraged to produce all the vocal exercises softly, with a frontal focus. The researchers demonstrated to the participants how the exercises were to be performed, instructed the them to produce the exercises themselves as a group, and finally divided the large group into smaller groups (2 or 3 people per group) to practice the exercises. Four student clinicians who were trained to perform VFE by the researchers directed each smaller group.</P>
<P>2) Indirect voice training (13)<BR/>The vocal hygiene (VH) programme was adapted from the VH programme used by Roy et al. The aim of the VH training was to introduce healthy vocal behaviours into the participants' daily interactions, particularly in the school environment. The topics covered in the VH session were the prevalence and impact of voice problems in teachers, basic anatomy and physiology of voice production, symptoms of voice disorders, strategies to reduce harmful vocal behaviours, managing and minimising health factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of voice problems, and changes to the speaking environment that increase vocal efficiency and reduce vocal harm.</P>

<P>INTERVENTION:<BR/>Treatment for craniomandibular disorder (CMD) by elimination of occlusal and articular interferences, i.e. by adjustment of the teeth. "The occlusal adjustment consisted of elimination of the slide in centric (i.e., the retruded contact position was made stable) and of the removal balancing, working, and protrusive interferences.

Listeners were blinded to the participant&#8217;s treatment allocation and whether the recording represented a pre- or postintervention condition." (p. 582) <BR/>Acoustic and electroglottographic analysis: "Acoustic measures included maximum phonation time (MPT) measured in seconds, standard deviation of fundamental frequency (SDF0) measured in Hertz (Hz), jitter measured in percentage (%), and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) measured in decibels (dB). The steady state vowel portion as judged by the fundamental frequency trace with a minimum of 3 seconds was chosen for each vowel. The average value of each measure across the three samples was calculated for every participant. A further measure, phonation range (PR) was calculated using a scale task whereby participants phonated an ascending scale on the phoneme /i/. Electroglottographic analysis was conducted on a 2-minute sample of connected speech during a reading task. The data analyzed from this sample included fundamental frequency (Hz) in connected speech (DFx) and duration of the closed phase (%) in each cycle of vocal fold vibration (Qx)." (p. 582-3)</P>
