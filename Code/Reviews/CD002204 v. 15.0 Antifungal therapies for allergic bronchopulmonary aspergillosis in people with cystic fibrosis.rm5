<TITLE>Treatments to fight fungal infections which cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:44:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We planned to review evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections which cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I>) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes cough and wheezing and sometimes fever. If left untreated ABPA can lead to chronic lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function deteriorating in the long term. Also, long-term use of steroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus which causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of steroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 29 September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>No trials were found which we could include in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There are some trials in people who don't have cystic fibrosis which have shown that if treatment is given to reduce the fungus, the steroid dose can be reduced with no adverse effects. However, in one cystic fibrosis centre, researchers observed that when people were given an anti-fungal treatment in addition to steroids, several of them became unable to produce enough cortisol (a hormone) in their adrenal glands in response to stress. There is not enough evidence for us to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. There should be a trial of these drugs to assess their effects in the long and the short term.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:44:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:44:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I> and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long-term benefits are not clear, their many side effects are well-documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I> and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been employed in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I>, and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-05-12 09:07:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:<BR/>1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo);<BR/>2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.</P>
<P>If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, duration and dose of antifungal therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:44:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>In addition, pharmaceutical companies were approached.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 29 September 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, where antifungal treatments have been compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment have been used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-16 13:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Four trials were identified by the searches; none of which was judged eligible for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:42:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>No completed randomised controlled trials were included.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-04 12:46:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, there are no randomised controlled trials to evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although trials in people who do not have cystic fibrosis have shown clinical and serological evidence of improvement and a reduction in the use of corticosteroids with no increase in adverse effects. Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate this potentially useful treatment for cystic fibrosis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:04:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder affecting Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Foundation-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Foundation 2000</LINK>). Chronic, progressive lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and shortened survival. This lung disease is characterised by a cycle of bacterial infection and lung damage (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1999</LINK>). With increasing age, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>is the major cause of chronic infection. However, a proportion of people with CF are also affected by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I> (<I>A. fumigatus</I>). ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Simmonds-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmonds 1990</LINK>). ABPA is diagnosed by a collection of clinical and laboratory criteria, including a consistent history; pulmonary infiltrates, which show as shadows on a chest X-ray (CXR); raised total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels; skin test reaction to <I>A. fumigatus</I> antigen; and antibodies to <I>A. fumigatus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Geller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 1999</LINK>). As these criteria are not specific and vary with the course of disease, a diagnosis of ABPA can be difficult to make.</P>
<P>The reported prevalence of ABPA in people with CF is around 10%, much higher than the non-CF population (<LINK REF="REF-Laufer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laufer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mroueh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mroueh 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmonds-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmonds 1990</LINK>). Many of the findings of ABPA overlap with common manifestations of the lung disease in CF.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:08:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Currently high doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA. However, an alternative strategy in the treatment of ABPA is to reduce or clear the lung of <I>A. fumigatus</I> colonisation by employing anti-fungal agents. A group of compounds, azoles, that can be taken orally, have activity against <I>A. fumigatus</I>.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Corticosteroids are thought to treat the inflammatory and allergic aspects of the condition. Whilst there is anecdotal evidence of impressive clinical and radiographic response to this therapy, there is little support from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Capewell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capewell 1989</LINK>). There is evidence from uncontrolled trials for the use of corticosteroids in ABPA in the non-CF population for acute treatment of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varkey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varkey 1998</LINK>); and at doses of prednisone of 7.5 mg/day they seem to inhibit the development of infiltrates (<LINK REF="REF-Safirstein-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safirstein 1973</LINK>). The long-term benefits of steroids on the course of the disease, particularly in people with CF, are not clear and their many side effects are well-documented (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Itraconazole is the most active of the group of compounds known as azoles (<LINK REF="REF-Denning-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denning 1992</LINK>). A separate compound with good activity against <I>A. fumigatus</I> is amphotericin B. However, this is not absorbed orally, and when given intravenously is frequently associated with toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Meunier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meunier 1991</LINK>). Amphotericin has been employed in a nebulised form to treat invasive infection with <I>A. fumigatus</I> but remains very expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Purcell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purcell 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Data from uncontrolled trials suggest itraconazole may be an effective additional therapy to steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Denning-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denning 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nepomuceno-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nepomuceno 1999</LINK>). The use of itraconazole for ABPA in people without CF is evaluated in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Wark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wark 2004</LINK>). A randomised, double-blind trial of the use of itraconazole in ABPA in people without CF (28 treated; 27 placebo) showed that those taking itraconazole responded better than those taking a dummy treatment (placebo). This was defined by a reduction of at least 50% in corticosteroid dose and 25% in serum IgE level, along with evidence of clinical improvement with no increase in adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2000</LINK>). A second randomised controlled trial of itraconazole in stable ABPA in people without CF showed a reduction in eosinophilic inflammation, serum IgE levels and exacerbations, implying that itraconazole is a useful adjunctive treatment for ABPA (<LINK REF="REF-Wark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wark 2003</LINK>). Whilst encouraging, these data need to be reproduced in larger trials and the specific effects of itraconazole for ABPA in CF need to be evaluated. It cannot be assumed that therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in the non-CF population will be equally efficacious and safe to use in people with CF.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of previously published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2014</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:15:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>At present, there are no RCTs to evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with CF.</P>
<P>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an important complication of CF, contributing to worsened morbidity and leading to progressive deterioration in lung function. Most of the findings of ABPA overlap with common manifestations of the lung disease in CF, which makes the diagnosis complicated. Whilst there is anecdotal evidence of response to corticosteroid therapy, there is no support from RCTs in CF. The long-term benefits of steroids on the course of the disease, particularly in people with CF, are not clear and their many side effects are well-documented. Consequently, treatment with antifungal agents may be advantageous over treatment with corticosteroids alone, and may lead to the ability to reduce the doses of steroid therapy. Two RCTs of itraconazole in ABPA in people without CF have shown a reduction in corticosteroid dose and eosinophilic inflammation, along with clinical and serological evidence of improvement with no increase in adverse events. A number of uncontrolled trials and case reports have also documented that the use of itraconazole in ABPA is advantageous. However, a recent report of suppression of adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis observed a potential adverse effect in 11 out of 25 people with CF treated with both itraconazole and budesonide. The likely pathogenesis is that an itraconazole caused an increase in systemic budesonide concentration due to inhibited metabolism, leading to suppressed adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Skov-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skov 2002</LINK>). The presence of adrenal insufficiency would be an important adverse effect to identify as an outcome measure in future trials.</P>
<P>Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate this potentially useful treatment for CF.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no published data available to recommend the use of antifungal therapies for ABPA in people with CF. Use of these drugs in people with CF remains experimental and RCTs evaluating both efficacy and safety are needed. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of antifungal therapies for ABPA in people with CF. Outcome measures, such as pulmonary function, should be clearly stated and multicentre trials should be co-ordinated so that maximum power is available to achieve a clear result. Trials should look at the effects on both acute exacerbations and chronic outcome measures and therefore cross-over trials would not be suitable. The adjuvant role of antifungals with corticosteroids should be investigated, including the effects on reduction of corticosteroid dose and the potential for serious adverse effects, including adrenal suppression. It cannot be assumed that therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in the non-CF population will be equally efficacious and safe to use in people with CF and therefore these two groups should be studied separately.</P>
