<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-02 09:39:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness with onset in childhood and adolescence. There are three main types of SMA. Drug treatment for SMA type I is discussed in a separate Cochrane review. This review is of drug treatment for SMA types II and III. Both of these reviews were first published in 2009 and are now updated. The age of onset of SMA type II is between six and 18 months. Children with SMA type II will never be able to walk without support; they survive beyond two years and may live into adolescence or longer. The age of onset of SMA III, also known as Kugelberg-Welander disease, is after 18 months. Children with SMA type III develop the ability to walk at some time and their life expectancy is normal.<B> </B>From six randomised controlled trials, there is no evidence for a significant effect on the disease course when patients with SMA types II and III are treated with creatine (55 participants), phenylbutyrate (107 participants), gabapentin (84 participants), thyrotropin releasing hormone (9 participants), hydroxyurea (57 participants) or combination therapy with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine (61 participants). The risk of bias of the included trials was systematically analysed and none of the studies were completely free of bias. Thus, there is still no known efficacious drug treatment for SMA types II and III.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:36:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Children with SMA type II do not develop the ability to walk without support and have a shortened life expectancy, whereas children with SMA type III develop the ability to walk and have a normal life expectancy. There are no known efficacious drug treatments that influence the disease course of SMA. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-10-02 09:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>To evaluate whether drug treatment is able to slow or arrest the disease progression of SMA types II and III and to assess if such therapy can be given safely. Drug treatment for SMA type I is the topic of a separate updated Cochrane review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-10-02 10:15:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (8 March 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1991 to February 2011), EMBASE (January 1991 to February 2011) and ISI Web of Knowledge (January 1991 to March 8 2011). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov to identify as yet unpublished trials (8 March 2011).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-02 09:29:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA types II and III. Participants had to fulfil the clinical criteria and have a deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (5q11.2-13.2) that was confirmed by genetic analysis.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was to be change in disability score within one year after the onset of treatment. Secondary outcome measures within one year after the onset of treatment were to be change in muscle strength, ability to stand or walk, change in quality of life, time from the start of treatment until death or full time ventilation and adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-21 09:30:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Two authors independently reviewed and extracted data from all potentially relevant trials. Pooled relative risks and pooled standardised mean differences were to be calculated to assess treatment efficacy. Risk of bias was systematically analysed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 15:05:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Six randomised placebo-controlled trials on treatment for SMA types II and III were found and included in the review: the four in the original review and two trials added in this update. The treatments were creatine (55 participants), phenylbutyrate (107 participants), gabapentin (84 participants), thyrotropin releasing hormone (9 participants), hydroxyurea (57 participants), and combination therapy with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine (61 participants). None of these studies were completely free of bias. All studies had adequate blinding, sequence generation and reports of primary outcomes.</P>
<P>None of the included trials showed any statistically significant effects on the outcome measures in participants with SMA types II and III. One participant died due to suffocation in the hydroxyurea trial and one participant died in the creatine trial. No participants in any of the other four trials died or reached the state of full time ventilation. Serious side effects were infrequent.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-02 09:34:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>There is no proven efficacious drug treatment for SMA types II and III.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-02 09:57:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder of childhood and adolescence with an annual incidence of 1 in 6000 to 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). It is caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spine and clinically manifests as progressive muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 2001</LINK>). Other parts of the peripheral nervous system such as the neuromuscular junction, and possibly the muscle, may be affected by disruption in maturation and development that is probably secondary to the deficiency of SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cifuentes_x002d_Diaz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifuentes-Diaz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kariya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kariya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The typical pattern of muscle weakness in SMA is weakness of the limbs, proximal more than distal, with the lower limbs involved earlier than the upper limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroksmark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroksmark 2001</LINK>). Intercostal muscles also become involved, usually sparing the diaphragm. Survival depends primarily on respiratory function and not necessarily on motor ability (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>). There is often a fine tremor in the fingers (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). Although the face is often spared, tongue fasciculations and facial weakness are not unusual findings (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1993</LINK>). The cognitive function of people with SMA is normal and at the end of the disease course there is often a striking discrepancy between alertness and the ability to move (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). Electrophysiological examination shows denervation and reinnervation (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are three main types of SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type I is the most common form and is also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, acute SMA and infantile-onset SMA. The age of onset is before six months. Children with SMA type I will never be able to sit without support and usually (without intensive supportive care) die by the age of two years (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2008</LINK>). SMA type is characterised by severe progressive muscle weakness and hypotonia (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). It is one of the most important causes of death due to a genetic disease in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type II is the intermediate type and is also known as intermediate SMA, juvenile SMA and chronic SMA. The age of onset is between six and 18 months. Children with SMA type II develop the ability to sit independently but are never able to walk without support. They often develop severe pulmonary and orthopaedic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>). The children survive beyond two years and may live into adolescence or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type III is known as Kugelberg-Welander disease, Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease and mild SMA. The age of onset is after 18 months. Children with SMA type III develop the ability to walk at some time although many will lose this ability again around puberty. Their life expectancy may be normal (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Classification of SMA according to the International SMA Collaboration is based on age of onset, maximal achieved motor function and age of death (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1992a</LINK>). Although there are different subtypes, in fact SMA has a broad clinical spectrum. There is overlap between subtypes as there are, for instance, children with SMA without the ability to sit but with a relatively long survival time (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>). There are children with SMA I who develop head control and other children with a chronic evolution from the onset. There are also children with SMA with disease onset before six months who have the ability to sit and others with disease onset before 18 months and the ability to walk (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>). The maximum function achieved predicts the natural course of the disease better than the age of onset (<LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1996</LINK>). A very severe type of SMA has been described with onset before birth and death within a few months, known as SMA type 0 or congenital SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>). At the other end of the spectrum a rare adult form of SMA, known as SMA type IV, has an age of onset after 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA (types 0 to IV) is an autosomal recessive disease and these types have been mapped to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (<LINK REF="REF-Brzustowicz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brzustowicz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melki-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melki-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>). This chromosomal region contains a duplicate SMN gene, the telomeric SMN gene (SMN1 or SMNt) and the centromeric SMN gene (SMN2 or SMNc) (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). The product of the SMN gene is the SMN protein. The SMN1 gene is transcribed into a full-length form, which results in a large amount of stable SMN protein. The SMN2 gene is transcribed into a truncated form lacking exon 7 (90%) which results in an unstable SMN protein without function and, to a lesser extent, a full-length form (10%) that results in a small amount of stable SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lorson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cartegni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartegni 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In SMA, the SMN1 gene is deleted or mutated in 95% to 99% of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2000</LINK>). Consequently, there is no transcription of stable SMN protein from the SMN1 gene and the SMN2 gene is not able to produce enough stable SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Cobben-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). The clinical severity of the disease depends on the amount of SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veldink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veldink 2001</LINK>) and this is related to the number of copies of the SMN2 gene (<LINK REF="REF-Feldkotter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldkotter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harada-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harada 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swoboda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swoboda 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008b</LINK>). Approximately two copies of the SMN2 gene (± 20% stable SMN protein) very frequently produce SMA type I, three copies (± 30% stable SMN protein) mostly produce SMA type II, and four copies (± 40% stable SMN protein) of the SMN2 gene produce SMA type III and type IV (<LINK REF="REF-Melki-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact cellular function of the SMN protein is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Sumner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumner 2007</LINK>). In motor neurons, the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) splicing is probably dependent on the abundance of SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pellizzoni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellizzoni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gendron-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gendron 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonka 2000</LINK>). SMN might be necessary for motor axon outgrowth (<LINK REF="REF-McWhorter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhorter 2003</LINK>) or SMN might have a protecting role in motor neurons against superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2007</LINK>). However, reduced amounts of functional SMN protein are found in all cell types of patients with SMA. The reason why abnormalities cause dysfunction of motor neurons and not other cell types remains to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). Other hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of SMA include defective inhibition of apoptosis, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, defective axonogenesis, and lack of neurotrophic factors in nerve or muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greensmith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greensmith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crawford-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merlini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Merlini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oprea-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oprea 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>Administration of agents capable of increasing the expression of SMN protein levels may improve the outcome in SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Lorson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldkotter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldkotter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gavrilina-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gavrilina 2008</LINK>). Transcriptional SMN2 activation, facilitation of correct SMN2 splicing, translational activation and stabilisation of the full-length SMN protein are considered as strategies for SMA therapy. Other strategies for therapy are improvement of motor neuron viability by neuroprotecting or neurotrophic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurmond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurmond 2008</LINK>). Recently, gene conversion from the SMN2 gene to the SMN1 gene in human cells from SMA patients has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-DiMatteo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiMatteo 2008</LINK>). Also, antisense application techniques are under investigation in preclinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hua-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hua 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hua-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hua 2008</LINK>). In the future, stem cell therapy or gene therapy may compensate for the lack of sufficient SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2008</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selecting trials for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>For this updated review, two authors (RW and AV) independently checked titles and abstracts obtained from literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. From the full texts, the authors independently selected the trials that met the selection criteria for inclusion and graded their methodological quality. Authors were not blinded to the trial author and source institution. Disagreement between the authors was resolved by reaching consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality assessment took into account allocation concealment, security of randomisation, intention-to-treat analysis, patient blinding (parent blinding), observer blinding, explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, explicit outcome criteria and how studies dealt with baseline differences between treatment groups. Each item was to be scored according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Risk of bias was graded as low, high or unclear. Two authors (RW and AV) graded the methodological quality independently. In the case of disagreement, authors reassessed studies and reached agreement by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to collect data from included trials</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (RW and AV) extracted data independently using a specially designed data extraction form. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. Disagreement did not occur but would have been resolved by reaching consensus or with third party adjudication if necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>We would have pooled only results of studies with the same class of drug treatment and performed analysis on SMA types II and III separately. For dichotomous data we would have calculated the relative risk for each study. To assess overall efficacy from all the studies, we would have calculated pooled relative risk estimates. When Chi<SUP>2</SUP> analysis showed the data to be heterogeneous, we would have used a random-effects model with a maximum likelihood estimation. If no heterogeneity had been demonstrated, we would have used a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio method). For continuous data, we would have calculated mean differences between the treatment and placebo groups for each study. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were to be calculated if data were sufficiently comparable between studies. If data were not sufficiently comparable between studies, the standard Review Manager (RevMan) generic inverse variance (GIV) analysis using treatment effect differences with their standard errors would have been used.</P>
<P>Statistical uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The trial investigators of two studies were contacted and provided raw data to facilitate these analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where studies had different follow-up periods, appropriate adjustments would have been used possibly with the RevMan GIV facility or, if necessary, Poisson regression allowing for the aggregate person-time at risk in the study groups. For survival or time to full time ventilation, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis would have been performed.</P>
<P>Statistical considerations would have involved a trade-off between bias and precision. Risk of bias was to be assessed as 'unclear' when too few details were available to make a judgement of &#8216;high&#8217; or &#8216;low&#8217; risk, when the risk of bias was genuinely unknown despite sufficient information about the conduct of the study, or when an entry was not relevant to a study. All studies were to be described by a precise risk of bias. Formal comparisons of intervention effects according to risk of bias would be done using meta-regression. The major approach to incorporating risk of bias assessments would be to incorporate and restrict meta-analyses to studies at low (or lower) risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section, we reviewed the results from open and uncontrolled studies. In addition, adverse events found in this review are discussed in relation to the side effects of drugs reported in the non-randomised literature.</P>

</P>
<P>This double-blind placebo-controlled trial compared combination therapy with oral valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine to placebo in 61 non-ambulatory children aged between two and eight years. Thirty-one children received treatment with 125 mg valproate given in divided doses two to three times a day and sufficient to maintain overnight trough levels of 100 mg/dL and acetyl-L-carnitine doses at 50 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. Thirty children received a double placebo. The duration of treatment was 12 months in the active treatment arm and six months in the placebo. After six months the placebo group switched over to active treatment per protocol.</P>
<P>In all participants the Modified Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (MHFMS) and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) were used to measure functional motor ability at baseline, three, six and 12 months after the start of treatment. The degree of innervation by the ulnar nerve was estimated using maximum ulnar compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude. Myometry measurements were performed in children aged five years and older (24 children) with no significant contractures: three times for right and left elbow flexion and for right and left knee extension. Also in the children aged five years and older, pulmonary function testing was performed, which included FVC, forced expiratory volume and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Quality of life was assessed using the PedsQL, filled in by parents at each visit. Children aged five years or older completed the age-appropriate PedsQL. Bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).</P>
<P>All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat population of 61 persons that was defined as all participants randomised to receive study medication. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare treatment groups for change in MHFMS from the baseline data. Non-normally distributed data were tested with the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</P>
<P>The primary endpoints were laboratory safety data, adverse event data and change in MHFMS from baseline after six months. Secondary endpoints included measurement from baseline at six and 12 months in MHFMS, estimates of CMAPs, DEXA, body composition and bone density, quantitative SMN mRNA and quality of life using PedsQL<SUP>TM</SUP>.

<P>This phase II/III double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial compared oral hydroxyurea with placebo in 57 participants with SMA types II and III aged above five years. Participants received an escalated daily dose over four weeks to a final daily dose of 20 mg/kg/day hydroxyurea or placebo. For the first four weeks participants received 10 mg/kg/day and for the second four weeks the dose was escalated to 15 mg/kg/day. After eight weeks participants received the final dose. Duration of treatment was 18 months. Follow-up of post-treatment effects was at six months.</P>
<P>The safety and tolerability of hydroxyurea were measured through serum level measurement. Muscle strength and motor function were measured with the Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) and the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). The GMFM and MMT were performed in all 57 participants. The MHFMS was performed in 28 participants with SMA type II and 10 participants with SMA type III who were already non-ambulatory at the beginning of the trial. Lung function was evaluated by FVC measurements. In all patients quantitative full-length SMN mRNA was measured. Adverse events and serious adverse events were monitored at each assessment by a complete blood count, chemistry profiles of liver and renal function, and completion of a questionnaire.</P>
<P>Treatment efficacy was evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis with a last observation carried forward approach. Changes in GMFM, MHFMS, MMT, FVC and serum flSMN mRNA were analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Measures at time points of the treatment period and the post-treatment period for primary and secondary endpoints were compared by mixed models with adjusted covariates. A 2-tailed t-test was used to compare the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events during the treatment phase.</P>
<P>The primary endpoints were the GMFM, MMT and serum full-length SMN mRNA level. Secondary endpoints were the MHFMS and FVC. These primary and secondary endpoints are discussed in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Change in muscle strength</HEADING>
<P>All six included trials measured muscle strength via quantitative myometry, but no significant differences were found for change in hand, arm, feet, leg or total muscle strength between the treatment and placebo groups.</P>
<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>) some patients were not able to perform all of the muscle strength tests and these patients were therefore not included in the analyses. Moreover, the raw data from this trial showed several extreme values of muscle strength in one particular participating centre. We therefore re-analysed the data with and without these outliers but this did not result in a different statistical outcome. For a limited number of patients in this trial, data were available at 12 months follow-up. Re-analysis of these limited data (shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, &#8216;Outcome of study <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>&#8217;) also showed no difference for change in muscle strength between the treatment and placebo groups.</P>
<P>In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tzeng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tzeng 2000</LINK>), a significant improvement in muscle strength was reported in one patient treated with thyrotropin releasing hormone. No comparison was made by the study investigators between the treatment and placebo groups because the study size was considered too small, but our re-analysis of their published data did not show a significant difference for change in muscle strength.</P>

<P>Data on the development of walking were available in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>). None of the patients who were unable to walk before treatment achieved this ability after treatment, and none of the patients who could walk lost this ability in either the treatment or placebo group. No significant difference between the treatment and placebo group was found for the development of walking, with a relative risk at nine months follow-up of 1.1 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.4) and a relative risk at 12 months follow-up of 0.87 (95% CI 0.38 to 2.0).</P>

In another trial two of<I> </I>54 participants treated with phenylbutyrate, compared with one of 53 participants who received placebo, had adverse effects and among these in each group only one had a severe adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2007</LINK>). In the third trial 13 of 27 participants treated with creatine and 16 of 28 participants who received placebo had an adverse effect; the authors were not able to provide data on severe adverse effects on request (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2007</LINK>). In one trial with hydroxyurea all patients had at least one adverse event and 33% of 61 participants had a severe adverse event. There were 224 adverse events in 37 participants treated with hydroxyurea and 129 adverse events in the placebo group of 20 participants. Severe adverse events occurred 19 and 10 times in the hydroxyurea group and placebo group respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2010</LINK>). In one trial 77% of the 30 patients receiving treatment with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine had one or more adverse event compared to 58% of the 31 participants in the placebo group. Severe adverse events occurred in 20% of the participants treated with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine and in 6% of the placebo group. Although (severe) adverse events occurred more often in the active treatment group this difference in occurrence was not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2010</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 15:09:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of drug treatment in patients with SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="STD-Tzeng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tzeng 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2010</LINK>); one of these trials included only patients with SMA type II (<LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2007</LINK>). One trial included only non-ambulatory patients with SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2010</LINK>). The treatments investigated were intravenous thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), oral gabapentin, oral phenylbutyrate, oral creatine, oral hydroxyurea, and oral combination therapy with valproate and oral acetyl-L-carnitine. Although open and uncontrolled trials with these drugs had seemed promising, the six RCTs did not show any efficacy on any of the outcome measures in patients with SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="STD-Tzeng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tzeng 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>We discuss the results of treatment with each of these drugs from trials in SMA and in other neuromuscular diseases, especially other motor neuron diseases.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)</HEADING>
<P>The precise mechanisms of action of TRH, a tripeptide produced by the hypothalamus, are unknown. It has a neurotrophic effect on spinal motor neurons of SMA patients (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 1994</LINK>). An effect of TRH in SMA was considered since an uncontrolled study found improvements in motor function and electromyographic findings in patients with SMA types II and III after thyrotropin releasing hormone therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 1994</LINK>). The small RCT with TRH in patients with SMA types II and III that was included in this review did not show objective differences between the TRH treatment group and the placebo group, although there were a few anecdotal improvements after treatment with TRH (<LINK REF="STD-Tzeng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tzeng 2000</LINK>). However, the trial was too small to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of treatment with TRH. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) some controlled trials with intravenous or subcutaneous administration of TRH or TRH analogues did show significant improvements on some outcome measures, but the effect was temporary and disease progression was not halted with any of the TRH analogues (<LINK REF="REF-Caroscio-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caroscio 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guiloff-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guiloff 1989</LINK>). Other studies did not show any positive effect of intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intrathecal treatment with TRH or TRH analogues compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitsumoto-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsumoto 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1992b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Gabapentin</HEADING>
<P>It is thought that gabapentin has a neuroprotective role by diminishing the excitotoxicity potential of glutamate (<LINK REF="REF-Greensmith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greensmith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merlini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Merlini 2003</LINK>). In a large randomised unblinded and uncontrolled trial with gabapentin in 120 patients with SMA types II and III, a trend for improvement in the strength of the arms, a significant improvement in muscle strength of the legs and in time walked in favour of gabapentin treatment were observed at 12 months, with no effect on forced vital capacity (FVC) or functional tests (<LINK REF="STD-Merlini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Merlini 2003</LINK>). Because this trial was neither blinded nor placebo-controlled, one cannot draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of gabapentin. In fact, the RCT included in this review did not demonstrate any efficacy of gabapentin in adult patients aged 21 years or older with SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001a</LINK>). An unblinded and uncontrolled randomised trial on treatment with gabapentin in ALS showed a slower decline in muscle strength in all gabapentin treated groups and a longer survival in the two groups treated with higher cumulative doses of gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Mazzini-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzini 1998</LINK>). A phase II randomised controlled trial in ALS observed a trend towards a slower decline in muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996b</LINK>). However, in the subsequent large phase III randomised-controlled trial, there was no evidence of a beneficial effect of gabapentin on disease progression or symptoms in patients with ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Phenylbutyrate</HEADING>
<P>Phenylbutyrate is one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors and a few studies have suggested a therapeutic role for these agents in SMA as they appeared to increase the expression of SMN2 (<LINK REF="REF-Kernochan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernochan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darras-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darras 2007</LINK>). Histone deacetylase inhibitors also display a neuroprotective capacity against oxidative stress in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Rouaux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouaux 2007</LINK>). In fibroblast cultures and leucocytes of patients with SMA and treated with phenylbutyrate, the drug was able to increase the SMN transcript expression (<LINK REF="REF-Andreassi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreassi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brahe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brahe 2005</LINK>). Also, based on the results from a pilot study with phenylbutyrate a positive effect on the disease course of SMA was expected (<LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2004</LINK>). In this uncontrolled trial, a functional improvement was found in 10 patients with SMA type II after nine weeks of treatment with oral phenylbutyrate (<LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2004</LINK>). However, the large RCT in SMA type II patients included in this review did not show any efficacy after three months of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mercuri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mercuri 2007</LINK>). A multicenter phase I/II trial evaluating multiple dosage levels of sodium phenylbutyrate to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the highest dose that can be safely given to children with SMA types II or III was terminated due to poor compliance to the study drug administration (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00439569" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00439569</LINK>). A phase I/II study on sodium phenylbutyrate in presymptomatic infants genetically confirmed to have SMA, probable SMA type II (and type I), is ongoing (for details see <LINK REF="REF-NCT00528268" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00528268</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Creatine</HEADING>
<P>Creatine may confer therapeutical benefit by increasing muscle mass and strength through its role as an energy shuttle between mitochondria and working musculature, and it could also exert neuroprotective effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bessman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bessman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>). In the RCT in patients with SMA types II and III that was included in this review, there was no evidence for a therapeutic effect of oral creatine (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2007</LINK>). Also, in ALS two large randomised placebo-controlled trials on treatment with creatine did not demonstrate improvements in overall survival, functional measurements or muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shefner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefner 2004</LINK>). Two small randomised placebo-controlled trials and a Cochrane review on oral creatine for hereditary muscle diseases found muscle strength improvement in muscular dystrophies but no effect in metabolic myopathies (<LINK REF="REF-Walter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kley 2011</LINK>). Two other Cochrane reviews on treatment in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2004</LINK>) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK>) did not show any effect of creatine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Valproate</HEADING>
<P>One of the drugs that showed positive results in in vitro and open label studies is valproate (<LINK REF="REF-Brichta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brichta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brichta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brichta 2006</LINK>). This is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that increases SMN protein in vitro by increasing transcription of SMN2 genes (<LINK REF="REF-Kernochan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernochan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weihl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weihl 2006</LINK>) and has an antiglutamatergic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2007</LINK>). Glutamate is released after presynaptic depolarisation and if the amino acid is not efficiently cleared this leads to increased levels of free radicals and eventually degeneration of motor neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 1996</LINK>). A retrospective uncontrolled open label study reported improvement in seven adult patients with SMA types III and IV during treatment with valproate (<LINK REF="STD-Weihl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weihl 2006</LINK>). In another retrospective uncontrolled open label study global muscle strength improved in two children and one adolescent with SMA types II and III, but no effect was observed in the other adolescent and two adults (<LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2007</LINK>). A large randomised trial is needed to establish the possible efficacy of valproate in patients with SMA. A phase II trial in patients with SMA types II and III aged above 18 years is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00481013" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00481013</LINK>). A randomised placebo-controlled trial of valproate in 163 patients with ALS found no evidence for a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008a</LINK>). In the recent phase II trial in non-ambulatory patients with SMA types II and III that was included in this review, combination therapy with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine, showed no significant improvement of motor function and muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2010</LINK>). An open label trial with valproic acid and carnitine in patients with SMA types II and III is ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00227266" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00227266</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hydroxyurea</HEADING>
<P>Hydroxyurea is another histone deacetylase inhibitor. In vitro, hydroxyurea did increase SMN2 gene expression and production of SMN protein in cultured lymphocytes of SMA patients (<LINK REF="REF-Grzeschik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grzeschik 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2008</LINK>). In an uncontrolled open label trial in two patients with SMA type I, five patients with SMA type II and two patients with SMA type III, hydroxyurea showed an improvement in muscle strength without side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>). A larger randomised uncontrolled trial from the same investigators included 33 patients with SMA types II and III who were treated for eight weeks with three different doses of hydroxyurea. SMN gene expression was enhanced and there was a trend towards improvement in some clinical outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Liang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2008</LINK>). There were no trials on treatment with hydroxyurea in other neuromuscular diseases. Thus hydroxyurea seems to be safe in patients with SMA types II and III but a possible efficacy was not established in the large RCT in 57 patients that was included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2010</LINK>). One randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children with SMA types II and III is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00568802" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00568802</LINK>).</P>
<P>Altogether, from the six RCTs included in this review, it can be concluded that there is no evidence for efficacy of one month treatment with intravenous thyrotropin releasing hormone, 12 months treatment with oral gabapentin, three months treatment with oral phenylbutyrate, six months combination treatment with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine, 18 months treatment with oral hydroxyurea or six months treatment with oral creatine in patients with SMA types II and III. From the RCTs with these drugs in other neuromuscular disorders, especially ALS, there is also no evidence for a therapeutic effect except for oral creatine in muscular dystrophies.</P>
<P>Other drugs that seem promising in open and uncontrolled trials in patients with SMA are described below. However a placebo effect is often underestimated and conclusions about efficacy should only be drawn from RCTs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Carnitine</HEADING>
<P>L-carnitine, an essential cofactor for the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, inhibits mitochondrial injury and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. A mitochondrial abnormality has been reported in patients with ALS and animal models of ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Kira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kira 2006</LINK>). Treatment with L-carnitine increased mitochondrial enzyme activities, delayed the onset of motor behaviour impairment and increased the life span in animal models of ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Bertamini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertamini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kira 2006</LINK>). A decrease of carnitine was found in muscles of patients with SMA type I and L-carnitine treatment restored the level of free carnitine to normal in an animal model (<LINK REF="REF-Bresolin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bresolin 1984</LINK>). Also, valproate-mediated carnitine insufficiency can be attenuated by L-carnitine supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Gibal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibal 1997</LINK>). Acetyl-L-carnitine, the non-acetylated derivative of L-carnitine, has neuroprotective and neurotrophic activity in motoneuron cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Bigini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigini 2002</LINK>).

In SMA fibroblasts, salbutamol has been shown to increase the SMN2 full-length mRNA and the SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Angelozzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelozzi 2008</LINK>). In an open label pilot trial that included 13 patients with SMA types II and III, there was a significant increase in muscle strength measured by myometry and FVC after six months of salbutamol treatment. The therapy was generally well tolerated but in several patients an increase in contractures was seen, which could reflect a stronger effect of salbutamol on agonist muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Kinali-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinali 2002</LINK>). In a second open trial involving 23 patients with SMA type II, the functional scores were significantly higher after six and 12 months of treatment with salbutamol and there were no major side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Pane-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pane 2008</LINK>). A pilot trial with salbutamol in children with central core and multi-minicore diseases also demonstrated an increase in functional abilities and muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Messina-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2004</LINK>). In a randomised placebo-controlled trial involving 90 patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, salbutamol did show some effect on secondary outcome measures but no overall effect on muscle strength or function (<LINK REF="REF-Kissel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2004</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Riluzole</HEADING>
<P>Riluzole is thought to have a neuroprotective effect on motor neurons by blocking the presynaptic release of glutamate. It has been proven to be modestly effective in slowing disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<LINK REF="REF-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacomblez-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacomblez 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riviere-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riviere 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Traynor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traynor 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>) with only minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Wokke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wokke 1996</LINK>). Surprisingly few studies have investigated the effect of riluzole in SMA, but riluzole has been shown to attenuate disease progression in an SMA mouse model (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2003</LINK>). There has been one randomised controlled study with riluzole in SMA type I (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 2003</LINK>) and this is analysed and discussed in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Wadman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadman 2011</LINK>). Briefly, this trial could not demonstrate an effect of riluzole in SMA type I because the power of this study was very low and the treatment and placebo groups were not comparable at baseline. However, three children with SMA type I who were treated with riluzole were still alive at the age of 30, 48 and 64 months, respectively, whereas in the placebo group all patients died (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 2003</LINK>). An RCT with riluzole in SMA types II and III is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00774423" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00774423</LINK>).</P>
<P>From studies on coenzyme Q10, lithium carbonate and guanidine hydrochloride, it was not clear on clinical grounds whether the patient population consisted only of patients with SMA type II or III (<LINK REF="REF-Angelini-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelini 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Il_x0027_ina-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Il'ina 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Folkers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Folkers 1995</LINK>) because SMN gene analysis was not possible prior to 1991. For example, four patients in one of these studies had pseudohypertrophy of the calves, suggesting a neuromuscular disease other than SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Angelini-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelini 1980</LINK>). Therefore, we have not discussed the therapeutic effects of these drugs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other neurotrophic factors</HEADING>
<P>Besides thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), other neurotrophic factors are considered as potential therapy for motor neuron diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Apfel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apfel 2001</LINK>). In a phase I trial of treatment with recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in patients with SMA type I no serious side effects were noted (<LINK REF="REF-Franz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franz 1995</LINK>). In a mouse model of SMA, cardiotrophin-1 seemed effective in slowing down disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Lesbordes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesbordes 2003</LINK>); glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), CNTF, insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) and neurotrophin-3 (via adenovirus mediated gene transfer) were also promising in studies on ALS animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Zurn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zurn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haase-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haase 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bilak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bordet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cabanes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabanes 2007</LINK>). However, two randomised placebo-controlled trials on CNTF in 570 and 730 patients with ALS and a meta-analysis were negative (<LINK REF="REF-ACTS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACTS 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bongioanni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bongioanni 2004</LINK>). In a randomised placebo-controlled trial of BDNF in 1135 patients with ALS, there was a trend toward increased survival (<LINK REF="REF-BDNF-Study-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDNF Study Group 1999</LINK>). A placebo-controlled pilot trial on intrathecal BDNF in 10 patients with ALS did not show an effect on autonomic function tests (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2005</LINK>). Treatment with xaliproden, a rhIGF-I analogue, did show a favorable trend on disease progression of ALS in two randomised placebo-controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Meininger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meininger 2004</LINK>). A randomised controlled pilot study of growth hormone treatment in patients with SMA types II and III is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00533221" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00533221</LINK>). The experimental drug olesoxime (cholest-4-en-3-one, oxime) is thought to modulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a critical step in cell apoptosis which is the mechanism by which motor neuron death is thought to occur in SMA and ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Bordet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordet 2008</LINK>). Olesoxime showed neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in four animal models of motor nerve degeneration, as well as antinociceptive and neuroprotective effects in experimental models of painful peripheral neuropathies. A phase II clinical trial in 185 patients with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy has been completed providing evidence that the compound is safe in diabetic patients exposed to this agent for six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00496457" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00496457</LINK>). A pivotal 18-month ALS European multicenter study was initiated in April 2009 and is still ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00868166" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00868166</LINK> ). A randomised placebo-controlled trial of olesoxime in children and adolescents with SMA types II and III was initiated in November 2010 and is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01302600" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01302600</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other glutamate inhibitors and antioxidants</HEADING>
<P>Lamotrigine, a glutamate inhibitor like riluzole, did not show a clinical effect on ALS in a randomised placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ryberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryberg 2003</LINK>). A randomised placebo-controlled trial in patients with ALS could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of treatment with a high dose of the antioxidant vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Graf-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 2005</LINK>), although in another randomised placebo-controlled trial patients with ALS who were treated with vitamin E remained in a milder disease state longer (<LINK REF="REF-Desnuelle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desnuelle 2001</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other agents increasing the expression of SMN protein levels</HEADING>
<P>A new direction for the development of drugs for patients with SMA are agents that are capable of increasing the expression of SMN protein levels. It has been shown that the cellular pH microenvironment can modulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing in vivo. In SMA cells 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, a Na<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> exchange inhibitor, significantly increased SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein production (<LINK REF="REF-Yuo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuo 2008</LINK>). PTK-SMA1, a tetracycline-like compound, stimulates exon 7 splicing and increases SMN protein levels in vitro and in vivo (<LINK REF="REF-Hastings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hastings 2009</LINK>). Also, a 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivative induced SMN protein in cells of a patient with SMA type I (<LINK REF="REF-Thurmond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurmond 2008</LINK>), ameliorated phenotype and increased survival in a SMA mouse model (<LINK REF="REF-Butchbach-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butchbach 2010</LINK>). Experimental histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, like (E)-resveratrol, seem to increase the level of full-length SMN2 mRNA and protein in in vitro studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dayangac_x002d_Erden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayangac-Erden 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The dysfunctional SMN2 gene and resulting lack of SMN protein are the result of alternative splicing in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene. Antisense oligonucleotides specifically targeting SMN2 transcripts can be used to induce exon 7 inclusion. Antisense applications are already being used for Duchenne dystrophy in a Phase II study (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Deutekom-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Deutekom 2007</LINK>) but may also be promising for further research and therapeutic approaches in SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Hua-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hua 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hua-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hua 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other experimental factors</HEADING>
<P>Some experimental studies do not focus on the SMN gene or SMN protein. Recombinant follastatin is a natural antagonist of myostatin, which is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle wasting. Administration of recombinant follastatin in an SMA mouse model showed increased muscle mass in several muscle groups, elevation in the number and cross-sectional area of ventral horn cells, functional improvement and extension of survival compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until now, and despite promising results in preclinical studies or in open and uncontrolled patient trials, no drug treatment has shown a therapeutical effect in randomised placebo-controlled trials of patients with SMA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Supportive care</HEADING>
<P>There is a broad range of practice regarding pulmonary, nutritional, orthopedic and other forms of supportive therapy in children and adults with SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2007</LINK>). Practice guidelines for the clinical care of children and adults with SMA are given in the consensus statement for standard care in SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2007</LINK>). For future trials it is important that the supportive care is the same in the different treatment arms.</P>

<P>Although some drugs looked promising in open or uncontrolled trials, the results of randomised placebo-controlled trials have been disappointing. Thus, there is still no evidence of significant efficacy for any drug treatment for SMA type II or III.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-03 15:36:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Potential drug treatments for SMA types II and III should be sought and large randomised placebo-controlled studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of these therapies and drugs. We would foremost recommend a trial with riluzole. Drug treatment in future trials should be given for an extended period of time and patient follow-up should be sufficiently long (preferably at least one year for both treatment and follow-up). Changes in motor function, disability, muscle strength, pulmonary function and quality of life should be assessed as outcome measures and possible side effects, especially serious adverse events, should be clearly reported. Developing a new functional rating scale or choosing an existent functional rating scale as a standard scale for all trials is recommended. Also, the time from the start of treatment until death or full time ventilation should be evaluated. The (intensive) supportive care in each treatment arm should be the same. Study investigators in multicenter trials should be well trained to reliably and consistently measure muscle strength by quantitative myometry and pulmonary function in order to avoid large variation in the measurements between and within the participating centres.</P>
