<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:08:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review to evaluate the effect of audit and feedback on the behaviour of health professionals and the health of their patients. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 140 studies that met their requirements. Their findings are summarised below.</P>
<P>
<B>The use of audit and feedback to influence health professional behaviour and patient health</B>
</P>
<P>In an audit and feedback process, an individual&#8217;s professional practice or performance is measured and then compared to professional standards or targets. In other words, their professional performance is &#8220;audited&#8221;. The results of this comparison are then fed back to the individual. The aim of this process is to encourage the individual to follow professional standards.</P>
<P>Audit and feedback is often used in healthcare organisations to improve health professionals&#8217; performance. It is often used together with other interventions, such as educational meetings or reminders.  Most of the studies in this review measured the effect of audit and feedback on doctors, although some studies measured the effect on nurses or pharmacists.  Audit and feedback was used to influence their performance in different areas, including the proper use of treatments or laboratory tests or improving the overall management of patients with chronic disease such as heart disease or diabetes. </P>
<P> After their performance had been measured, the health professionals were given feedback either verbally, in writing, or both.  In some studies, this feedback was given to them by the researchers responsible for the study, while in other studies, feedback was given by supervisors or colleagues, by professional organisations or by someone representing their employer. In some studies, health professionals were given feedback only once, while others were given feedback once a week or once a month. </P>
<P>In some studies, health professionals were simply given information about their performance and how this compared to professional standards or targets. In other studies, health professionals were also given a specific target that they personally were expected to reach, or were given an action plan with suggestions or advice about how to improve their performance.</P>
<P>
<B>What happens when health professionals are given audit and feedback?</B>
</P>
<P>The effect of using audit and feedback varied widely across the included studies. Overall, the review shows that:</P>
<P>
<I>The effect of audit and feedback on professional behaviour and on patient outcomes ranges from little or no effect to a substantial effect. The quality of the evidence is moderate.</I>
</P>
<P>Audit and feedback may be most effective when:</P>
<P>1. the health professionals are not performing well to start out with;</P>
<P>2. the person responsible for the audit and feedback is a supervisor or colleague;</P>
<P>3. it is provided more than once;</P>
<P>4. it is given both verbally and in writing;</P>
<P>5. it includes clear targets and an action plan.</P>
<P>In addition, the effect of audit and feedback may be influenced by the type of behaviour it is targeting. It is uncertain whether audit and feedback is more effective when combined with other interventions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:06:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Audit and feedback is widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice either on its own or as a component of multifaceted quality improvement interventions. This is based on the belief that healthcare professionals are prompted to modify their practice when given performance feedback showing that their clinical practice is inconsistent with a desirable target. Despite its prevalence as a quality improvement strategy, there remains uncertainty regarding both the effectiveness of audit and feedback in improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of audit and feedback that lead to greater impact.</P>

<P>Randomised trials of audit and feedback (defined as a summary of clinical performance over a specified period of time) that reported objectively measured health professional practice or patient outcomes.

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:07:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All data were abstracted by two independent review authors. For the primary outcome(s) in each study, we calculated the median absolute risk difference (RD) (adjusted for baseline performance) of compliance with desired practice compliance for dichotomous outcomes and the median percent change relative to the control group for continuous outcomes. Across studies the median effect size was weighted by number of health professionals involved in each study. We investigated the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: format of feedback, source of feedback, frequency of feedback, instructions for improvement, direction of change required, baseline performance, profession of recipient, and risk of bias within the trial itself. We also conducted exploratory analyses to assess the role of context and the targeted clinical behaviour. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual, and qualitative analyses were undertaken to examine variation in effect size related to these factors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:08:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included and analysed 140 studies for this review. In the main analyses, a total of 108 comparisons from 70 studies compared any intervention in which audit and feedback was a core, essential component to usual care and evaluated effects on professional practice. After excluding studies at high risk of bias, there were 82 comparisons from 49 studies featuring dichotomous outcomes, and the weighted median adjusted RD was a 4.3% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5% to 16%) absolute increase in healthcare professionals' compliance with desired practice. Across 26 comparisons from 21 studies with continuous outcomes, the weighted median adjusted percent change relative to control was 1.3% (IQR = 1.3% to 28.9%). For patient outcomes, the weighted median RD was -0.4% (IQR -1.3% to 1.6%) for 12 comparisons from six studies reporting dichotomous outcomes and the weighted median percentage change was 17% (IQR 1.5% to 17%) for eight comparisons from five studies reporting continuous outcomes. Multivariable meta-regression indicated that feedback may be more effective when baseline performance is low, the source is a supervisor or colleague, it is provided more than once, it is delivered in both verbal and written formats, and when it includes both explicit targets and an action plan. In addition, the effect size varied based on the clinical behaviour targeted by the intervention.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-13 23:11:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Audit and feedback generally leads to small but potentially important improvements in professional practice. The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to depend on baseline performance and how the feedback is provided. Future studies of audit and feedback should directly compare different ways of providing feedback.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:08:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Audit and feedback is widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice. This review updates a previous Cochrane review of the effects of audit and feedback (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>), where we defined audit and feedback as a 'summary of the clinical performance of healthcare provider(s) over a specified period of time'.</P>
<P>Earlier versions of this review found that audit and feedback can have an effect on professional practice and patient outcomes, but even when it is effective, these effects are generally small to moderate. Furthermore, the impact of audit and feedback is highly variable (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0213">Thomson OBrien 1997a</A>;<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0214">Thomson OBrien 1997b</A>).  While few studies have directly investigated the relative effectiveness of different characteristics of audit and feedback, it does seem that feedback has the greatest effect when baseline compliance with recommended practice was low (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>). Due to both the heterogeneity of studies and the methodology of these reviews, we remained limited in our ability to make recommendations regarding characteristics most likely to lead to successful feedback interventions.</P>
<P>Foy et al (<LINK REF="REF-Foy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foy 2005</LINK>) concisely summarised the problem stating that, &#8220;Audit and feedback will continue to be an unreliable approach to quality improvement until we learn how and when it works best.&#8221;</P>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:08:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many theories exist (with multiple overlapping constructs) to further explain how feedback may lead to quality improvement (for a review of such theories, see <LINK REF="REF-Grol-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 2007</LINK>).  Briefly, individual behaviour change theories suggest that feedback may work in many ways, including (but not limited to) changing recipient awareness and beliefs about current practice and subsequent clinical consequences, changing perceived social norms, affecting self-efficacy, or by directing attention to a specific set of tasks (sub-goals). The observation that the effects of audit and feedback are greatest if baseline compliance is low supports the idea that audit and feedback is felt to be effective as a tool to improve practice because it may overcome healthcare providers&#8217; limited ability to self-assess accurately (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2006</LINK>). Under this assumption, providers are thought to be inherently motivated to improve care, but lacking intention to change their current practices in large part because they are unaware of their suboptimal performance. In turn, they may be prompted to modify their practice if given feedback that their clinical practice was inconsistent with their peers or with accepted guidelines.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, even if intention to change behaviour is strong, the desired action may depend on multiple factors beyond the control of the healthcare provider. Organisational theories focused on quality improvement offer clues regarding potential important effect modifiers, including organisational culture with respect to quality improvement, and the &#8216;actionability&#8217; of feedback reports (<LINK REF="REF-Hysong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hysong 2006</LINK>). Van der Veer et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Veer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Veer 2010</LINK>) conducted a systematic review of the impact on quality of care of using medical registries to produce feedback reports to healthcare professionals. They analysed 53 studies of widely varying quality and considered both quantitative and qualitative data. Most of the studies featured multifaceted interventions. They noted that important effect modifiers seemed to be the quality of the data provided to recipients, the motivation and interest of recipients, and the organisational support for quality improvement.</P>
<P>Some potentially important variables are difficult to operationalise in a trial and others have been tested with uncertain results. For instance, although perceived social and professional norms are considered important predictors of behaviour change, there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of peer-comparison in feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Kiefe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kiefe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_ndergaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Søndergaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wones-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wones 1987</LINK>). In an attempt to further delineate how to most effectively design and deliver feedback interventions, Hysong (<LINK REF="REF-Hysong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hysong 2009</LINK>) completed a re-analysis of the 2006 Cochrane review based on "Feedback Intervention Theory" (<LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1996</LINK>). The results showed greater effectiveness with increasing frequency of the feedback, with written rather than verbal or graphical delivery and with feedback that included information about the correct solution.</P>
<P>Similarly, Gardner and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2010</LINK>) conducted a re-analysis of the 2006 Cochrane review that applied the Control Theory of Carver and Scheier (<LINK REF="REF-Carver-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carver 1982</LINK>), to test target-setting and action plans as effect-modifiers of feedback. Although the results of that re-analysis were inconclusive because very few studies explicitly described their use of targets or action plans, there is empirical evidence from non-health literature to suggest that goal-setting can increase the effectiveness of feedback (<LINK REF="REF-Locke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locke 2002</LINK>), especially if specific and measurable goals are used. However, the role of participant involvement in either target-setting or in feedback interventions seems promising (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 1992</LINK>) but remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Nasser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasser 2008</LINK>). Other empirical work from the psychology literature has demonstrated the value of action-plans with respect to improving the effectiveness of feedback (<LINK REF="REF-Sniehotta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sniehotta 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>Regardless of the feedback design, the nature of the clinical change that the feedback tries to encourage may play a role in the effectiveness of the intervention. Qualitative work indicates that it may be easier to comply with guidelines that aim to increase rather than decrease behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Carlsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlsen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>The aim of the current update is to investigate the effectiveness of audit and feedback to improve processes and outcomes of care and to examine factors that could influence the effectiveness of this intervention. Given the variability in results of the prior review and the inability to satisfactorily explain this based on intuitive factors, this review will attempt to examine multiple theory-informed feedback design characteristics. In so doing, we hope this review will clarify the effectiveness of audit and feedback in general and inform stakeholders regarding how to best employ feedback to change provider behaviours.</P>

<P>In addition, <B>
<I>for question 2 we also conducted a meta-regression on the studies in comparison A</I>
</B>. In the previous review, we subjectively categorised both the &#8220;<I>intensity</I>&#8221; of the feedback intervention and the &#8220;<I>complexity</I>&#8221; of the targeted behaviour, but this approach did not adequately predict feedback effectiveness in a manner that would clearly inform future intervention design. Therefore, to investigate the effectiveness of different ways of providing audit and feedback and other factors that might modify the effects of audit and feedback, studies in this review were characterised according to a selection of variables considered to be both important (based on relevant literature reviewed in the background section above and our knowledge of theories of behaviour change) and accessible in published manuscripts (based on the prior experience of our systematic review authors). Specifically, we used meta-regression to examine the effects of four ways of providing audit and feedback that might increase its effectiveness.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Providing instruction for improvement with the feedback in the form of specific goals and/or action plans</LI>
<LI>Providing verbal feedback in addition to written feedback</LI>
<LI>Providing feedback from a senior or respected colleague, supervisor, employer, purchaser or professional standards review organisation (compared with feedback provided by researchers)</LI>
<LI>Providing more frequent feedback</LI>
</UL>
<P>We also examined additional factors not related to the intervention itself that might increase the effects of audit and feedback or its apparent effects.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lower baseline compliance</LI>
<LI>Feedback requiring increasing current behaviours (compared to decreasing behaviours or changing the approach to a clinical problem)</LI>
<LI>Audit and feedback targeting health professionals other than physicians</LI>
<LI>Higher risk of bias in the primary study</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are many important factors that may predict effectiveness of audit and feedback; the basis for selecting the above factors to examine in a meta-regression and not including other potential effect modifiers is summarised in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. (This appendix is not a comprehensive listing of all possible audit-and-feedback questions, but includes the key factors that we considered for inclusion in this update.)</P>
<P>We recognize the importance of context with respect to the effectiveness of an intervention. In particular, the relative complexity of the targeted behaviour likely plays a role in the ability of feedback to increase guideline adherence. To investigate this issue, we conducted a limited number of exploratory subgroup analyses based on the target of the intervention.</P>

<P>Audit and feedback, defined as 'any summary of clinical performance of health care over a specified period of time'. One may alternatively describe an audit and feedback intervention as 'clinical performance feedback'. The feedback may include recommendations for clinical action and may be delivered in a written, electronic or verbal format.</P>
<P>Studies that focused on real-time feedback for procedural skills were excluded as were studies in which the feedback focused on performance on tests or simulated patient interactions. Studies that featured facilitated relay of communication regarding patient status or symptoms but that did not provide a summary of physician performance were also excluded. In general, even if the term 'feedback' was used in the manuscript, the study was excluded if the intervention would be best classified as 'facilitated relay' of patient-specific clinical information or a 'reminder' (especially when the intervention was at the point of care), or any other unique category in the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>) classification of quality improvement interventions other than 'audit and feedback' (see also: <LINK REF="REF-Shojania-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shojania 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update, we only included interventions where we assessed audit and feedback to be a core or essential element. To this end, we categorised studies by the extent to which audit and feedback was the core component of the intervention into three groups: (i) audit and feedback alone; (ii) audit and feedback as a core, essential component of a multifaceted intervention; or (iii) audit and feedback as a component of a multifaceted intervention but not considered &#8216;core and essential&#8217;. In multifaceted interventions (which we defined as studies that utilised two or more interventions aiming to change the behaviour of health professionals), we made the distinction between 'core' and 'not core' by considering whether the other components were likely to be used in the absence of audit and feedback, or whether the audit and feedback seemed to provide the foundation for the rest of the intervention. In cases where the audit and feedback was merely added to a multifaceted intervention that could easily be offered in its absence, the study would be classified as 'not core'.</P>
<P>For comparisons C, D, E, and F, we used the EPOC classification (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>) scheme to identify the components of the multifaceted interventions. We used this classification to differentiate between RCTs that tested different ways of designing or delivering an audit and feedback intervention (comparison D) and RCTs that tested whether additional intervention(s) along with audit and feedback were more effective than audit and feedback alone (comparison E). To illustrate, when a suggestion for improvement accompanies the feedback report, it may alternatively be viewed as a co-intervention (clinician education) or as an intrinsic feature of the feedback design (action plan). As with all other abstracted descriptive variables, this process was completed independently by two abstractors and discrepancies resolved through discussion, including other authors as needed.</P>

<P>Two review authors (NI, GJ, SFl, or JY) independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria; complete manuscripts were sought in the case of uncertainty and differences of opinion resolved through consensus.

<P>Two review authors (GJ, NI, SFl, or SFr) independently assessed the risk of bias of each study and extracted data for newly identified studies using a revised data collection form; discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third author as needed. The risk of bias for each main outcome in all studies included in the review was assessed according to the revised EPOC criteria. The degree of confidence in the estimate of effect across studies was assessed using GRADEpro and the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>An overall assessment of the risk of bias (high, moderate or low risk of bias) was assigned to each of the included studies using the approach suggested in the Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Studies with low risk of bias for all key domains or where it seems unlikely for bias to seriously alter the results were considered to have a low risk of bias. Studies where risk of bias in at least one domain was unclear or judged to have some bias that could plausibly raise doubts about the conclusions were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Studies with a high risk of bias in at least one domain or judged to have serious bias that decreased the certainty of the conclusions were considered to have a high risk of bias.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:10:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All outcomes were expressed as compliance with desired practice. Professional and patient outcomes were analysed separately. For trials reporting summary and individual measures of performance, the summary measures were used. When several outcomes were reported in a trial we only extracted results for the variable(s) explicitly described as the primary outcome(s). When the primary outcome was not specified we took the variable(s) described in the sample size calculation as the primary outcome. When the primary outcome was still unclear or when the manuscript described several primary outcomes, we calculated the median value across multiple outcomes.</P>
<P>Since important baseline differences between intervention and control groups are frequently found in cluster-randomised trials, our primary analyses was based on estimates of effect that were adjusted for baseline differences. Therefore, only studies providing data on baseline performance were included in the statistical analysis. Baseline compliance, defined as compliance with desired practice (or with the targeted behaviours) prior to the intervention, was treated as a continuous variable ranging from zero to 100%, based on the median value of pre-intervention level of compliance in the audit and feedback group and control group. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the adjusted risk difference (RD) as the difference in adherence after the intervention minus the difference before the intervention. A positive RD indicates that performance improved more in the audit and feedback group than in the control group (eg. an adjusted RD of 0.09 indicates an absolute improvement in compliance with targeted behaviours of 9%). For continuous outcomes, we calculated adjusted change relative to the control group as the post-intervention difference in means minus the baseline difference in means divided by the baseline control group mean. As with the adjusted RD, a positive change indicates that performance improved more in the audit and feedback group than in the control group. This is a relative effect rather than an absolute effect; the effect size reflects the baseline performance as well as the change in performance and it is not bound between -100 and +100%.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, we expected that most of the trials would be randomised by cluster. Under such circumstances it is necessary to adjust results from primary trials for clustering before they are included in a meta-analyses in order to avoid underestimating the standard error (SE) of the estimate of effect. As in the previous versions of this review, we have not abstracted the observed SEs, P values, or confidence intervals for our statistical analysis, instead performing meta-regression using the number of health professionals as the basis for weighting.</P>

<P>Across studies, the median effect size was weighted by the number of health professionals involved in the trial reported to ensure that very small trials did not contribute the same to the overall estimate as larger trials. If the number of health professionals was not reported, the number of practices/hospitals/communities was used instead. Thus, the summary statistics in the meta-analyses reported as weighted median adjusted RD or weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control are weighted by the number of health professionals, while the results reported from individual studies are not. The primary analyses excluded studies at high risk of bias.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:10:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Visual analyses were supplemented with meta-regression to examine how the size of the effect (adjusted RD) was related to the potential explanatory variables (listed below), weighted according to the number of healthcare professionals. We accounted for baseline differences in compliance by using adjusted estimates of effect to avoid the effect of potentially important baseline differences in compliance between groups. We conducted a multivariable linear regression using main effects only; baseline compliance treated as a continuous explanatory variable and the others as categorical. For this analysis we excluded studies with a high risk of bias. The analyses were conducted using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS (Version 9.2. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), where we also took the dependency between comparisons from the same trial into account. P values were based on the classical sandwich estimator.</P>
<P>Each comparison was characterised relative to the other variables in the tables, looking at one potential explanatory variable at a time in univariate analyses. If the number of included studies was large enough, we also performed a multivariate analysis including all potential explanatory variables. We assessed the following potential sources of heterogeneity to explain variation in the results of the included studies. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Format (verbal; written; both; unclear)</LI>
<LI>Source (supervisor or senior colleague; professional standards review organisation or representative of employer/purchaser; investigators; unclear)</LI>
<LI>Frequency (weekly; monthly; less than monthly; one-time)</LI>
<LI>Instruction for improvement (explicit measurable target or specific goal but no action plan; action plan with suggestions or advice given to help participants improve but no goal/target; both; neither)</LI>
<LI>Direction of change required (increase current behaviour; decrease current behaviour; mix or unclear)</LI>
<LI>Recipient (physician; other health professional)</LI>
<LI>Risk of bias (high; unclear; low)</LI>
<LI>Baseline compliance (continuous measure of health professionals' compliance with desired practice)</LI>
</UL>
<P>We hypothesised that audit and feedback with the following characteristics would be most effective: provided in both verbal and written format, from a supervisor or senior colleague, delivered more frequently than less, featuring both specific goals and action plans, aiming to increase rather than decrease behaviours, and received by non-physician providers. We also hypothesised that studies with low risk of bias would be associated with smaller effect sizes.</P>
<P>In addition, we conducted two exploratory analyses to examine the importance of context and the relative complexity of the targeted behaviour on the likelihood that feedback would improve professional practice. We compared the effectiveness of feedback in outpatient (primary care or outpatient clinics) and hospital (inpatient, emergency room or hospital) settings. In addition, we considered common targets of feedback interventions, including: appropriate prescribing, test-ordering (laboratory or radiology), and diabetes or cardiovascular disease management (two chronic clinical conditions with similar management and targets). We did not have any a priori hypotheses for these analyses. However, the second analysis reflects two hypotheses that we tested in the previous update of this review: that the effectiveness of feedback would be greater for behaviours that are important but not complex (ie. prescribing) compared to more complex behaviours (ie. disease management) or compared to behaviours that clinicians might perceive as less important (ie. test-ordering). For these analyses, we compared the weighted median effect sizes and conducted a univariate meta-regression for studies reporting dichotomous outcomes. If we found potentially important and statistically significant differences, we included these explanatory factors in the full model for the meta-regression described above to assess the robustness of these exploratory findings.</P>

<P>For this update we screened 3623 new studies and reviewed the full text of 282. The total number of studies included is 140. Of note, 53 new studies were added to this review since the previous update and 31 were removed from the previous version of the review as they no longer met our inclusion criteria. See study flow diagram for details (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>All abstracted information is available upon request; the general characteristics of the included studies are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The unit of allocation was a single healthcare provider in 51 studies (5056 total providers, median 56), groups of clusters of healthcare professionals (e.g. clinics, wards, hospitals, communities) in 88 studies (5267 total clusters, median 32), and in one study (24 providers, 1140 patients) the unit of allocation was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Everett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Everett 1983</LINK>). Twenty studies had four arms, 22 studies had three and the remaining 98 had two arms.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of setting and professionals</HEADING>
<P>Eighty trials were based in North America (69 in USA, 11 in Canada), 21 in the UK or Ireland, 10 in Australia or New Zealand, and 29 elsewhere. Only four studies were from low- and middle-income countries (two in Sudan, one in Thailand, and one in Laos).</P>
<P>In 121 trials the targeted health professionals for the intervention were physicians. Five studies explicitly targeted pharmacists and 16 studies explicitly targeted nurses. The most common clinical specialty area was general or family practice, targeted in 84 trials. Ninety-four trials were in an outpatient setting, 36 were in inpatient settings, and in 10 studies the clinical setting was unclear.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Targeted behaviours</HEADING>
<P>There were 39 trials specifically aiming to improve appropriate prescribing and 31 specifically targeting laboratory or radiology test utilisation. Thirty-four trials focused on management of patients with either cardiovascular disease or diabetes (two exemplar chronic conditions with common management strategies). The remaining trials varied widely across conditions and targeted behaviours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of interventions</HEADING>
<P>There were 49 studies in which audit and feedback was the only intervention, while audit and feedback was considered the core, essential component of a multifaceted intervention in 91 studies.</P>
<P>The format of the feedback was clearly reported in 129 studies: 13 had verbal feedback, 84 had written feedback, and 32 had both. In the majority of studies (112), the source of the feedback was unclear or it was provided by the researchers who had no other relationship to the recipients. In 13 studies feedback was provided from a supervisor or senior colleague, and in 15 from a 'professional standards review organisation' or representative of the employer or purchaser. The frequency of the feedback was weekly in 11 trials, monthly in 19 trials, repeated but less than monthly in 36, and once only in 68 trials.</P>
<P>In 11 studies the feedback provided recipients with explicit, measurable goals and 41 studies included action plans or correct solution information with the feedback. The feedback had both these features in four studies and neither in 84 studies. In 57 studies, the feedback required recipients to increase current behaviours; in 29 they had to decrease current behaviours, and in 55 studies the feedback was judged to require a complex or uncertain change in behaviour.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>There was large variation in outcome measures, and studies often reported multiple primary outcomes related to compliance with different aspects of a guideline. Most trials measured professional practice, such as prescribing or use of laboratory tests. Some trials reported both practice and patient outcomes such as smoking status or blood pressure. There was a mixture of dichotomous outcomes (for example the proportion compliance with guidelines or the proportion of patients with appropriate management) and continuous outcome measures (for example costs, number of laboratory tests, or number of prescriptions) across and within studies.</P>
<P>Baseline performance was not reported in 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Everett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Everett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn--1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandbaek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandbaek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wones-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wones 1987</LINK>).</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. Of the 140 trials, 44 (31%) had a low risk of bias, 71 (51%) had an unclear risk of bias, and 25 (18%) had a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Batty-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batty 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boekeloo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Boekeloo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown--1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buffington-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Buffington 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canovas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Canovas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charrier-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Charrier 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Claes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Claes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Everett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Everett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foster-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gama-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gama 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehlbach-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gehlbach 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millard-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Millard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandbaek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandbaek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_ndergaard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Søndergaard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wadland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zwar 1999</LINK>). The most common sources of a high risk of bias related to lack of similarity at baseline (ten trials), lack of outcome blinding (e.g. when outcomes were reported by participating healthcare professionals) (ten trials), and due to incomplete follow-up (six trials). Clarity of reporting regarding the risk of bias variables was frequently inadequate. For example, the nature of the randomisation sequence was unclear in 81 trials, outcome blinding was unclear in 61 trials, similarity at baseline was unclear in 48 trials, and risk of contamination was unclear in 45 trials. Randomisation was clearly concealed (or there was cluster randomisation) in 117 trials. There was adequate follow-up in 111 trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison A. Any intervention in which audit and feedback is the single intervention or is the core, essential feature of a multifaceted intervention, compared to usual care</HEADING>
<P>A total of 171 comparisons from 109 studies were included in this comparison. Of these, 17 comparisons from 10 studies had no baseline data, and 21 comparisons from 14 studies were at high risk of bias. Twenty-five comparisons from 15 studies included patient outcomes as a primary outcome. Thus, 108 comparisons from 70 studies were included in the primary analyses assessing the effects of audit and feedback on professional practice.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous measures of compliance with desired practice</HEADING>
<P>There were 124 total comparisons, of which 11 comparisons were removed due to lack of adequate baseline data. Of the 113 remaining comparisons, 15 had patient-oriented outcomes, leaving 98 comparisons from 62 studies. In the primary meta-analysis, a further 16 comparisons from 12 studies at high risk of bias were excluded, leaving 82 comparisons from 49 studies with dichotomous outcomes. These studies included 2310 clusters/groups of health providers (from 32 cluster trials), and 2053 health professionals (from 17 trials allocating individual providers).</P>
<P>For these studies, the weighted median adjusted RD was a 4.3% increase in compliance with desired practice (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5% to 16%). The weighted median RD when studies with high risk of bias were included in the sensitivity analysis was also 4.3% (IQR 0.6% to 16%).</P>
<P>The range in adjusted RDs for compliance with desired practice was wide: a 9% absolute decrease to a 70% increase in compliance. Of the 98 total comparisons, 27 had an adjusted RD of at least 10% and in 20 comparisons the adjusted RD was between 5% and 10%. For 50 comparisons the adjusted RD was small (ranging from -5% to 5%). Only one study reported a negative effect greater than 5%; an adjusted RD of -9% for appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="STD-Batty-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batty 2001</LINK>). This study had a high risk of bias due to imbalance at baseline. Three other studies had unusually large effect sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Foster-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 2007</LINK> reported a 45% increase in the utilisation of peak flow in asthma patients. This study had a high risk of bias due to incomplete follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Gehlbach-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gehlbach 1984</LINK> reported a 45% improvement in the use of generic prescriptions and this study also had a high risk of bias. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 1998</LINK> showed a 70% increase in the provision of skin cancer preventive advice among pharmacists, from a baseline performance of 0%. As in the previous version of this review, this study was excluded from the primary analysis because it differed from the others, as it aimed to initiate an entirely new clinical behaviour in the intervention group, rather than help providers to improve their performance in an area of known professional responsibility.</P>
<P>There were 11 comparisons from seven studies with dichotomous outcomes that did not report baseline data (<LINK REF="STD-Balas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandbaek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandbaek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 1986</LINK>). The range of (unadjusted) RD seen in these studies was -2.3% to 29.2%. The median unadjusted RD for these studies was 4% (IQR 1% to 7%).<BR/>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous measures of compliance with desired practice</HEADING>
<P>There were 47 total comparisons, of which six were removed due to lack of adequate baseline data. Of the 41 remaining comparisons with continuous primary outcomes, 10 had patient-oriented outcomes, leaving 31 comparisons from 25 studies. The primary meta-analysis excluded a further five comparisons from four studies at high risk of bias leaving 26 comparisons from 21 studies with continuous outcomes. These studies included 661 groups of healthcare providers (from 13 cluster trials) and 605 healthcare professionals (from eight trials allocating individual providers).</P>
<P>For these studies, the weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control was a 1.3% increase in compliance with desired practice (IQR 1.3% to 23.2%). When studies at high risk of bias were included, the weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control was 2.9% (IQR 1.3% to 26.1%).</P>
<P>The adjusted change relative to baseline control varied widely, from a 50% decrease in desired practice to a 139% increase in desired practice. Of the 31 total comparisons with continuous outcomes, 21 had an adjusted change relative to baseline control of at least 10%. For eight comparisons the adjusted change relative to baseline control was relatively small (-5% to 5%). Two comparisons had larger negative effects: one (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>) showed a 10% relative increase in benzodiazepine/sedative medications; the other comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1982</LINK>) showed a 50% relative increase in laboratory test utilisation, but actually reported a positive effect during the intervention period, which reversed after the intervention stopped. The trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wadland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wadland 2007</LINK>) that reported a 139% relative increase in smoking cessation referrals had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There were six comparisons from three studies with continuous outcomes that did not report baseline data (<LINK REF="STD-Everett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Everett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn--1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wones-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wones 1987</LINK>). The median effect seen in these studies was a 54% relative increase in desired practice (IQR 15.1% to 54%)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buffington-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Buffington 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fairbrother-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fairbrother 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gullion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gullion 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hemminiki-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hemminiki 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendryx-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hendryx 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn--1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lomas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lomas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rantz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rantz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svetkey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svetkey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2007</LINK>) reported patient-type outcomes as a primary outcome. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Linn--1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>) did not have any baseline data, and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buffington-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Buffington 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 2008</LINK>) had a high risk of bias, leaving 12 comparisons with dichotomous outcomes and eight comparisons with continuous outcomes for analysis.</P>
<P>There was minimal discernable effect observed for patient outcomes with dichotomous outcomes, while a positive effect was noted in studies with continuous outcomes. Specifically, for dichotomous outcomes, the weighted median adjusted RD was a 0.4% decrease in desired outcomes (IQR -1.3% to 1.6%) and for continuous outcomes, the weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control was a 17% improvement (IQR 1.5% to 17%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The multivariable meta-regression analysis explored the role of five characteristics of the intervention (format, source, frequency, instructions for improvement, direction of change required), two characteristics of the recipients (baseline performance, profession), and one characteristic of the trial design (risk of bias) on heterogeneity in effect size. This was performed on trials that had dichotomous outcomes and that compared audit and feedback as the only intervention or as the core, essential feature of a multi-faceted intervention versus usual care. Studies at high risk of bias were excluded, leaving 80 comparisons in this analysis with either unclear or low risk of bias.</P>
<P>All five characteristics of the intervention were identified as significant in the model, as described in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, indicating that the format (P = 0.02), source (P &lt; 0.001), frequency (P &lt; 0.001), instructions for improvement (P &lt; 0.001), and the direction of change required (P = 0.007) each help explain variation in effects. Within these variables, relatively large differences in effect size were seen when comparing certain characteristics: presented in both verbal and written format versus only verbal (expected difference in adjusted RD = 8%); delivered by a supervisor or senior colleague versus the investigators (expected difference in adjusted RD = 11%); frequency of monthly versus once only (expected difference in adjusted RD = 7%); containing both an explicit, measurable target and a specific action plan versus neither (expected difference in adjusted RD = 5%); and requiring a decrease versus an increase of current behaviour to achieve a higher score (expected difference in adjusted RD = 6%).</P>
<P>Risk of bias (P = 0.679) and profession (physician versus non-physician) (P = 0.561) were not associated with variation in effect size. Lower baseline performance was associated with greater effectiveness for the intervention (P = 0.007). To illustrate, the model predicts that recipients who achieved 25% of desired practice at baseline would have an expected adjusted RD of 9%, while those who achieved 75% of desired practice at baseline would have an expected adjusted RD of only 5%. See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for a bubble plot of effect size by baseline performance.</P>
<P>Examination of box plots for each of the explanatory variables primary analysis supported the statistical conclusions (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). For exploratory purposes, we also examined box plots for explanatory variables considering trials with continuous outcomes from Comparison A. This did not result in any qualitative differences in the assessment of heterogeneity. Finally, we examined the box plots for trials with dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, for Comparison B (audit and feedback alone versus usual care) and then for Comparison C (audit and feedback as the core, essential feature of a multifaceted intervention versus usual care), separately. These analyses revealed consistency in the direction of effects for the explanatory variables, supporting the initial conclusions.</P>
<P>Although the multifaceted studies appeared to have a larger median effect size, when comparing the mean estimate of effect for audit and feedback alone versus audit and feedback in a multifaceted intervention using a univariate analysis we found that the differences were not statistically significant for dichotomous outcomes (estimated absolute difference in adjusted RD = 3.3%; P = 0.27). The similarity in estimated adjusted RD is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>. However, there was a significant difference when examining the studies with continuous outcomes (estimated absolute difference in adjusted change relative to baseline control = 24%; P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis adding level of analysis (patient versus provider versus cluster) to the model did not lead to any significant changes in the results. In another sensitivity analysis, when studies with a high risk of bias were included in the model, the findings remained consistent, with two exceptions: format (written versus verbal versus both) no longer had a significant effect, but profession of recipient did, with non-physicians performing better than physicians. It was observed that the model-based estimated effect sizes increased when the high risk of bias studies were included, suggesting caution is needed when interpreting these results. Given that some of the strata within the model were quite small (e.g. only six comparisons from four studies assessed 'both' goals and action plans), such instability is not surprising.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exploratory analyses</HEADING>
<P>Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the importance of context and the complexity of the targeted behaviour on the likelihood that audit and feedback will improve professional practice. Although clinical setting (outpatient versus inpatient versus mixed, other or unclear) was marginally statistically significant in the multivariate meta-regression model (P = 0.037), the estimated effects were similar across inpatient and outpatient settings (inpatient estimated RD = 7.7%; outpatient estimated RD = 7.1%; mixed, other or unclear estimated RD = 3.0%).</P>
<P>When 'targeted behaviour' (prescribing versus laboratory or radiology utilisation versus diabetes or cardiovascular disease management versus other) was added to the meta-regression model, it was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001), with estimated RD for prescribing (11.1%) larger than diabetes or cardiovascular disease (5.9%), laboratory or radiology testing (4.2%), or other (4.7%). In that model, the 'direction of change required' (increase current behaviour versus decrease versus mix/other) was no longer statistically significant (P = 0.525) and the estimates for some other variables changed (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). We then conducted meta-analyses on the subgroups of studies that focused on the targeted behaviours of interest. For prescribing, the weighted median adjusted RD was 13.1% (IQR 3% to 17%) based on 26 comparisons with dichotomous outcomes at unclear or low risk of bias. For laboratory or radiology test utilisation, the weighted median adjusted RD was -0.1% (IQR -0.1% to 6.5%) based on three comparisons, and for trials focusing on the management of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, the weighted median adjusted RD was 0.5% (IQR -0.5% to 3.4%) based on 14 comparisons.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison B. Audit and feedback alone compared to no intervention</HEADING>
<P>A total of 82 comparisons from 65 studies were included in this comparison. Nine comparisons from six trials did not report baseline data and 13 comparisons from 10 trials assessed patient outcomes as a primary outcome, leaving 59 comparisons from 48 studies for the analyses.</P>
<P>For studies with audit and feedback alone targeting professional practice with dichotomous outcomes, there were nine comparisons from seven studies excluded due to high risk of bias, leaving 32 comparisons from 26 studies for the primary analysis. These studies included 759 groups of health providers (from 12 cluster trials) and 1617 health professionals (from 14 trials allocating individual providers). The weighted median adjusted RD was 3.0% (IQR 1.8% to 7.7%). Including the studies at high risk of bias resulted in no change to the estimate of effect.</P>
<P>For studies with audit and feedback alone targeting professional practice with continuous outcomes, there were five comparisons from four studies excluded due to high risk of bias, leaving 14 comparisons from 13 studies for the primary analysis. These studies included 348 groups of health providers (from eight cluster trials) and 494 health professionals (from five trials allocating individual providers). The weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control was 1.3% (IQR 1.3% to 11.0%). Including the studies at high risk of bias studies in the sensitivity analysis also resulted in a weighted adjusted change relative to baseline control of 1.3% (IQR 1.3% to 20.1%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison C. Audit and feedback as the core feature of a multifaceted intervention compared to no intervention</HEADING>
<P>A total of 90 comparisons from 65 studies were included in this comparison. Seven comparisons from six trials did not report baseline data and 13 comparisons from nine trials assessed patient outcomes as a primary outcome, leaving 70 comparisons from 50 studies for the analyses.</P>
<P>For studies with multifaceted interventions featuring audit and feedback targeting professional practice with dichotomous outcomes, there were seven comparisons from seven studies excluded due to high risk of bias, leaving 50 comparisons from 32 studies for the primary analysis. These studies included 1574 groups of health providers (from 26 cluster trials) and 480 health professionals (from seven trials allocating individual providers). The weighted median adjusted RD was 5.5% (IQR 0.4% to 16%). Including high risk of bias studies in the sensitivity analysis resulted in a revised weighted adjusted RD = 6.5% (IQR 0.5% to 16%).</P>
<P>For studies with multifaceted interventions featuring audit and feedback targeting professional practice with continuous outcomes, there were 12 comparisons from 11 studies for the primary analysis. These studies included 317 groups of health providers (from seven cluster trials) and 111 health professionals (from four trials allocating individual providers). The weighted median adjusted change relative to baseline control was 26.1% (IQR 12.7% to 26.1%). There were no studies in this group with high risk of bias.<I>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison D. Different ways of providing audit and feedback (head-to-head comparisons)</HEADING>
<P>Seventeen trials included 16 head-to-head comparisons of different ways of providing audit and feedback. For each comparison, we determined the adjusted RD or the adjusted change relative to baseline control. This is reported below in addition to any statistical comparisons conducted by the authors of a particular study (e.g. odds ratios or P values) to provide a standard measure of effect across all comparisons in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Peer comparison</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_ndergaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Søndergaard 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wones-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wones 1987</LINK> each found small differences when adding peer comparison data to the audit and feedback for asthma management (adjusted RD = 2%) or inpatient laboratory test utilisation (adjusted change relative to baseline control = 5%), respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Kiefe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kiefe 2001</LINK> compared audit and feedback featuring a mean score of peers with feedback that featured an &#8220;achievable benchmark&#8221; (the mean score of the top 10% of peers). They found that the achievable benchmark group improved quality of care for diabetic patients (median adjusted RD = 3%, IQR = 2% to 4%). In particular, statistically significant increases were observed for influenza vaccination (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.96), foot examination, (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.69) and haemoglobin A1C measurement (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69), while cholesterol measurement (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.51) and triglyceride measurement (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.44) had non-statistically significant increases. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> found that identifying top performers in feedback presented in a quality circle (i.e. learning collaborative) did not lead to improvements in management of asthma (adjusted RD = -5%, high risk of bias).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Presentation of feedback and inclusion of additional information</HEADING>

<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2005</LINK> found that feedback was slightly more effective for control of blood pressure if it presented information in a way that identified patients at higher risk, suggesting that action for such patients should be prioritised (adjusted RD = 2%; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.70).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison E. Audit and feedback combined with complementary interventions compared to audit and feedback alone</HEADING>
<P>Fifty-three comparisons from 43 trials were included. Below, the results of these comparisons are summarised within categories related to the 'type' of intervention that audit and feedback was combined with when comparing to audit and feedback alone. We acknowledge that some of the multifaceted interventions may fit into multiple categories, but only describe the findings from each trial once. Multi-arm studies may be described in multiple sections corresponding with the type of comparison. Due to the variation in outcome type (dichotomous, continuous, patient, provider) across the studies, we were unable to conduct quantitative meta-analyses, with the exception of trials comparing audit and feedback with educational outreach to audit and feedback alone (see below). For each comparison, we determined the adjusted RD or the adjusted per cent change relative to baseline performance in the audit and feedback alone arm. This is reported below in addition to any statistical comparisons conducted by the authors of a particular study (e.g. odds ratios or P values) to provide a standard measure of effect across all comparisons in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Audit and feedback with educational outreach compared to audit and feedback alone</HEADING>
<P>We found 24 comparisons from 19 studies that compared audit and feedback alone to the combination of audit and feedback and educational outreach (also known as academic detailing). For the 15 studies with dichotomous outcomes focusing on professional practice, the weighted median adjusted RD for audit and feedback with outreach versus feedback alone was a 0.7% increase in desired practice (IQR -1.1% to 5.1%). For the four studies with continuous outcomes, the median adjusted change relative to baseline control was 27% (IQR 0% to 40.5%).</P>
<P>The PINCER trial (<LINK REF="STD-Avery-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Avery 2010</LINK>) had a median adjusted RD = 1.6 across three outcomes related to safe prescribing. However, in their multivariable model they found that educational outreach by a pharmacist reduced unsafe prescribing practices by GPs compared to feedback alone for the primary outcomes of NSAID (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drug) use without PPI (proton-pump-inhibitor) (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89), beta-blocker use in asthmatics (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91), and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) or diuretic use without electrolyte measurements (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78). The educational outreach in <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001</LINK> focused on showing primary care providers how to utilise the feedback reports to develop and implement systematic patient recall systems. This resulted in an improvement (adjusted RD = 22%; P = 0.002) in the proportion of patients with adequate assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, but no differences in actual treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK> also found that outreach led to small but statistically significant improvements in diabetes care compared with postal feedback alone (adjusted change for relative to baseline performance in the audit and feedback alone arm = 35%; P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Two 2x2 factorial studies in Sudan both found small effects on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing with academic detailing compared to audit and feedback alone (<LINK REF="STD-Awad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Awad 2006</LINK> - adjusted change relative to baseline performance in the audit and feedback alone arm = 29%, P &lt; 0.001; <LINK REF="STD-Eltayeb-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eltayeb 2005</LINK> - adjusted RD = 9.2%, no P value reported).</P>
<P>Six other studies comparing educational outreach plus feedback to audit and feedback alone had mixed findings. <LINK REF="STD-McClellan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McClellan 2004</LINK> found small, but potentially clinically meaningful improvements in the management of dialysis by adding a multifaceted intervention including educational outreach to feedback (difference in mean urea reduction ratio: P = 0.002), but no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome (proportion of patients with urea reduction ratio &gt; 65%: adjusted RD = 0.70%; P = 0.8). <LINK REF="STD-Rask-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rask 2001</LINK> found that outreach improved diabetes care for only one of six professional outcomes (median adjusted RD = 9.5%, high risk of bias; no overall P value reported) but not in any of three patient outcomes (median adjusted RD = 0%, high risk of bias; no P value reported for this comparison). <LINK REF="STD-Siriwardena-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Siriwardena 2002</LINK> found that only two of seven outcomes related to immunisation rates improved (median adjusted RD = 5%, no overall P value reported). <LINK REF="STD-Kinsinger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsinger 1998</LINK> combined audit and feedback with educational outreach aiming to help primary care providers improve office systems to increase breast cancer screening rates.<I> </I>The intervention did improve the office systems and found an increase in the proportion of patients discussing mammograms (adjusted RD = 4.75%; P = 0.01), but not a statistically significant difference in actual mammography rates (P = 0.56) compared with feedback alone. Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-Mold-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mold 2008</LINK> found that academic detailing led to increased implementation of a variety of quality improvement processes in primary care (e.g. standardised protocols), but these efforts translated into a statistically significant improvement in only one of six preventive services measured (median adjusted RD = 8%, no overall P value reported). Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Ornstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ornstein 2004</LINK> found statistically significant improvement in only two of 21 outcomes related to preventive cardiovascular care in the primary care setting and a difference in overall improvement that was not statistically significant (adjusted RD = 5.5%, P &gt; 0.2).</P>
<P>Opinion leaders were explicitly identified to provide the educational outreach in three studies. <LINK REF="STD-Soumerai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soumerai 1998</LINK> found improvements in two of four outcomes related to management of acute myocardial infarction (median adjusted RD = 8.5; no overall P value presented). <LINK REF="STD-Laskshminarayan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Laskshminarayan 2010</LINK> found significant improvement in two of 10 outcomes related to management of acute ischaemic strokes in hospital, but no overall effect (median adjusted RD = 4%; P value reported as non-significant). <LINK REF="STD-Guadagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guadagnoli 2000</LINK> found no differences for breast cancer treatment (adjusted RD = -2%; no P value reported).</P>

However, in the hospital setting <LINK REF="STD-Kritchevsky-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kritchevsky 2008</LINK> found that adding a quality improvement collaborative to feedback alone did not improve the utilisation of antibiotics within one hour prior to surgery (adjusted RD = -3.6%; absolute risk reduction (ARR) -3.8, 95% CI -13.9 to 6.2). Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-Filardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Filardo 2009</LINK> found that education regarding continuous quality improvement had no statistically significant impact on hospital-based quality indicators for pneumonia or heart failure compared to feedback alone (median adjusted RD = -1.7%; P = 0.47), although the authors reported that this finding may be due to poor participation in the intervention group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hayes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hayes 2001</LINK> performed a study comparing written feedback with feedback enhanced by the participation of a trained physician, quality improvement tools, and a project liaison for anticoagulant management of venous thrombosis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:16:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Audit and feedback can be a useful intervention to improve health professionals' compliance with desired practice. The median adjusted risk difference (RD) of compliance with desired practice was a 4.3% absolute increase in desired practice (IQR 0.5% to 16%) when considering any trial in which audit and feedback was considered the core, essential aspect of the intervention, compared to no audit and feedback. For continuous variables, we found that the weighted median adjusted change relative to the performance of the control group at baseline was a 1.3% increase in compliance with desired practice (IQR 1.3% to 23.2%). Although the median effect may be perceived as relatively small, the 75th percentile effect size is much larger (16% absolute improvement in health professionals compliance with desired behaviour), suggesting that audit and feedback, when optimally-designed and used in the right context, can play an important role in improving professional practice.</P>
<P>There are a number of plausible explanations why some interventions were more effective than others and we tested some of the hypothesised variables in a meta-regression. As in the previous versions of this review, we found that baseline performance was associated (inversely) with the effectiveness of audit and feedback. The meta-regression provides indirect evidence that five feedback characteristics are also associated with the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions. Specifically, our findings indicate that feedback will be most effective when provided from a source that is a 'supervisor or senior colleague', and delivered at least 'monthly', in both a 'verbal and written' format, aiming to decrease rather than increase provider behaviours, and offers instructions with 'both explicit goals and a specific action plan'. However, the ability to make firm conclusions from the analysis of heterogeneity is hindered both by the indirect nature of the comparisons and by the non-specific nature of the components of those variables. For instance, while it appears that verbal feedback is the least effective format, such 'verbal' feedback could have been a lecture to a large group or a one-to-one discussion. Likewise, while it appears that a 'supervisor or colleague' is the most effective source, this finding may depend on whether or not the colleague is a respected opinion leader. In addition, the difference in effect between interventions aiming to decrease or increase behaviours vanished when the targeted behaviour was analysed in the exploratory analysis. Therefore, the results of our meta-regression should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies provided direct, randomised comparisons of different ways of providing audit and feedback; only four of these trials were published after 2003. Based on these comparisons and also based on indirect comparisons across studies it is difficult to determine what other features of audit and feedback have an important impact on its effectiveness. For example, we found conflicting evidence regarding the role of peer comparisons. <LINK REF="STD-Kiefe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kiefe 2001</LINK> indicated that comparing to the top 10% of peers might be an improvement over comparing to the mean, but <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> found that identifying top performers in the context of a quality circle did not increase the effectiveness of feedback. The difference may reflect the role of explicit goal/target setting in determining the reaction to feedback (<LINK REF="REF-Locke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carver-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carver 1982</LINK>). Active participation in goal-setting may also play an important role (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 1992</LINK>). Although there are theoretical reasons why some forms of audit and feedback might be more effective than others, there remains a need to operationalise and directly compare different approaches to improving the design and delivery of audit and feedback. For now, decisions about when to provide audit and feedback must largely be guided by pragmatic considerations and hypotheses based on a priori theory.</P>
<P>In addition to the design of the intervention itself, it is likely that the characteristics of the context and the recipients might influence the effectiveness of feedback. Furthermore, feedback might also be best suited for changing specific types of behaviours; for example, more complex targeted behaviours might be harder to change by providing feedback. When we attempted in the previous version of this review to include the complexity of the targeted behaviour as a variable in our meta-regression, we did not find a statistically significant association between the complexity of the targeted behaviour and the effectiveness of feedback, possibly because it was difficult to reliably assess complexity.</P>
<P>In this review, we conducted an exploratory analysis for a small number of targeted behaviours (prescribing, test-ordering, and management of diabetes or cardiovascular disease) chosen because they were frequently targeted in feedback trials. We found a relatively large effect for prescribing (median adjusted RD 13.1%) compared with test-ordering (-0.1%) and management of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (0.5%). A plausible explanation for this difference is that prescribing is typically not a complex behaviour and may be perceived as important, whereas test-ordering may be perceived as less important (and might be more complex) and disease management is typically more complex. However, within the diabetes and cardiovascular disease subgroup there was great variation in the targeted behaviours. This is also true of the prescribing and the test-ordering subgroups. In some trials, the intention was to increase prescribing, test-ordering or referrals (addressing under-use), while in others the goal was to reduce utilisation (addressing over-use). It is important that future trials consider carefully the intended target of the intervention and precisely describe the targeted behaviours, ideally including an assessment of their complexity and perceived importance. Although our analysis suggests that audit and feedback might be highly effective for improving prescribing (and less effective for test-ordering or disease management), this was an exploratory analysis and there remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding which clinical or behavioural targets would be most appropriate for audit and feedback.</P>
<P>The previous version of this review investigated the impact of audit and feedback when used as part of a multifaceted intervention, finding little evidence of enhanced effectiveness, consistent with other reviews that have concluded that multifaceted interventions are not necessarily more effective than single strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Forsetlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsetlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2008</LINK>). In this review, we found that when audit and feedback was combined with other interventions, the effect size of the intervention was larger than when audit and feedback was used alone. This difference was statistically significant for studies with continuous outcomes but not with dichotomous outcomes. The results were also inconsistent with respect to suggesting which combinations of interventions might be most effective. Thus, the added costs of multifaceted interventions need to be weighed against the uncertainty of whether a multifaceted intervention is likely to produce a greater effect. When and how to best combine feedback with other interventions warrants systematic investigation, ideally through a series of comparative trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:16:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the variation in effect size is noteworthy and requires further study, the consistency of median effect size found in this review compared with the previous review, despite changes in methodology, is of interest. While the best way to design and deliver feedback remains uncertain, this review provides greater certainty about its likely effect compared with usual care across a variety of clinical situations. Given the large number of RCTs included in this review and the stability in effect size observed over time, we believe it is unlikely that missing or new trials of audit and feedback versus usual care would substantially alter the estimated median effect of audit and feedback on professional practice. Thus, future trials should aim to determine the best way to deliver audit and feedback in head-to-head trials rather than comparing audit and feedback to usual care.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-04-22 12:05:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In most of the included studies, the method of allocation was not clearly indicated in the published report. Although lack of allocation concealment can result in overestimates of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Odgard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgard-Jensen 2011</LINK>), the importance of this criterion in trials where a group of healthcare professionals is randomised at one point in time is not established. In this review, we have given cluster-randomised trials the benefit of the doubt and assumed that there was adequate concealment of allocation for these studies.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, we judged only 32% of the included studies to have a low risk of bias. This compares favourably to the previous version of this review in which only 20% of the included trials had a low risk of bias. However, we judged 18% of the studies included in this review to have a high risk of bias, while in the previous review only 12% were deemed high risk of bias. The lower proportion of studies with unclear risk of bias may represent improved reporting over time. As with the previous review, we found no association between overall risk of bias (low versus unclear) and the estimate of effect.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:16:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, our inclusion criteria required that at least one arm of the trial use audit and feedback as the core, essential feature of the intervention. This was necessary to avoid including trials of multifaceted interventions where feedback was included but where the main effects of the intervention were unlikely to be due to feedback. If some effective multifaceted interventions were inappropriately excluded, this would create a conservative bias (and vice-versa). Although application of this criterion depended on judgements made by the review authors, only eight disagreements occurred between independent reviewers of 282 full-text manuscripts reviewed and all were resolved easily through discussion. Furthermore, the similarity in the estimate of effectiveness for multifaceted interventions featuring audit and feedback between this review (adjusted RD 5.5%) and the previous review (adjusted RD 5.7%) supports the notion that the operationalisation of this criterion did not substantively bias the results.</P>
<P>In earlier reviews of this topic, we considered printed educational materials to have little or no effect on changing professional practice based on information available at the time (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2001</LINK>). However, recent reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>) found that printed educational materials have a small (but potentially important) effect. By abstracting printed materials as usual care for many studies, we may have created a conservative bias for studies comparing feedback to printed materials, but an overestimation of the effect attributed to audit and feedback in studies where feedback plus printed materials are compared to no intervention. In most studies educational materials were distributed to all groups, thus meeting a pragmatic definition of usual care.</P>
<P>One possible reason for our finding that few studies featured patient outcomes is that we only abstracted primary outcomes and many studies provided patient outcomes as secondary outcomes. This assessment would have been easier to make if more studies clearly stated their primary outcome in general and if more studies had planned to have a patient level outcome as the primary outcome. However, since most studies reporting patient outcomes as secondary outcomes are likely to be under powered to detect a difference in patient outcomes, this is unlikely to have affected our finding that improvements in patient outcomes were at best small. The reason for this is that impacts on patient outcomes depend on the combined effectiveness of feedback on professional practice and the effectiveness of the clinical intervention (delivered as a result of the changed in professional practice). Since the effectiveness of feedback is typically small or moderate (e.g. a 4.3% absolute improvement) and the effectiveness of targeted clinical interventions (changes in practice) is typically moderate, feedback can only be expected to have a small effect on patient outcomes in most circumstances. Thus large trials are needed to reliably measure the impacts of feedback on patient outcomes.</P>
<P>As illustrated in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>, there are many possible factors related to feedback design that could potentially predict effectiveness. It is certainly possible that we neglected to abstract some important design factors, especially organisational and contextual characteristics. We limited the exploration of such factors for pragmatic reasons (based on feasibility of abstraction) and to limit risk of spurious findings.</P>
<P>We chose to focus on comparisons where it was possible to calculate an adjusted risk difference and adjusted change relative to the baseline control. The adjustments were based on pre-intervention measurements of the outcome in the audit and feedback group. We excluded from the quantitative analyses studies without baseline data because of previous evidence that baseline performance is associated with effectiveness of audit and feedback. Since many studies included small numbers of healthcare professionals, baseline differences were common and unadjusted estimates of effect often differed from the adjusted estimates. This being said, we acknowledge that, ideally, across a systematic review these baseline differences should cancel each other out (as each imbalance is random); thus the post intervention comparison should be just as useful as the adjusted estimates, as long as studies lacking such data were not systematically different in other respects. Therefore, our choice to exclude studies without baseline measurements from analyses may be regarded as an additional potential limitation of the review.</P>
<P>We weighted the analyses by the number of health professionals involved in each trial. Trials that did not report the number of health professionals involved were weighted by the number of practices/hospitals/communities involved in the trial; this typically occurred when the unit of allocation was a cluster of providers (e.g. practice, hospital, or community) rather than a single provider. This approach may have led to some larger studies with many participants but relatively few clusters being assigned a weight that did not reflect the actual size of the trial.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:16:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The previous update of this Cochrane review found similar estimates of effect for audit and feedback on professional practices. It also found that greater "intensity" of feedback was associated with greater effect. However, the assessment of "intensity" simultaneously captured numerous variables and was, therefore, difficult to operationalise as it could not discern which components were most important. In this review, we tested five specific characteristics of feedback design in a meta-regression in an attempt to identify important active ingredients of audit and feedback.</P>
<P>The sources of feedback associated with the lowest effect size were 'professionals standards review organisation' and 'representative of the employer or purchaser'. This fits well with previous qualitative work comparing high and low performing hospitals finding that feedback with a punitive tone seems to be less effective (<LINK REF="REF-Hysong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hysong 2006</LINK>). Also of note was the stability in effect across clinical setting and profession of recipient, although the latter finding may be due to the paucity of trials with interventions directed to non-physicians. Our finding that risk of bias was not associated with effect size is consistent with the previous version of this review. In both cases, this may be explained by suboptimal reporting, resulting in many risk of bias domains judged to be 'unclear'.</P>
<P>The findings of this review regarding format and source were consistent with a re-analysis of a previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Hysong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hysong 2009</LINK>) and should also be considered in light of the Feedback Intervention Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1996</LINK>), which suggests that feedback that directs attention towards acceptable and familiar tasks (as opposed to those that generate emotional responses or cause deep self-reflection) seem most likely to lead to improvement. Our results regarding action-planning are also consistent with the re-analysis of the previous version of the review informed by the Feedback Intervention Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Hysong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hysong 2009</LINK>). However, a separate re-analysis of the previous version of this review aiming to test the hypothesis regarding goal-setting and action-planning found too few studies to reach any conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2010</LINK>). Although we hypothesised based on <LINK REF="REF-Carlsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlsen 2007</LINK> that feedback aiming to increase provider behaviours would be more effective than feedback aiming to decrease behaviours we found that the opposite was true. This suggests that stated preferences with respect to quality improvement interventions should be empirically tested.</P>
<P>In this review, we also found evidence that the targeted behaviour may be associated with the effectiveness of feedback. In particular, we found that feedback aiming to change prescribing habits may be more effective that feedback aiming to improve chronic disease management. A recent review of audit and feedback given to general practitioners regarding diabetes management (<LINK REF="REF-Guldberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guldberg 2009</LINK>) included 10 studies with great heterogeneity in outcomes. The authors were unable to conclude which diabetes process measures should be targeted by future interventions and more work is clearly needed in this area.</P>
<P>Previous reviews have looked at factors associated with the effectiveness of audit and feedback and we recognised from the outset that there are far more plausible factors that could alter the effectiveness of audit and feedback than we could test in this review.</P>
<P>Mugford and colleagues (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0204">Mugford 1991</A>) identified 36 published studies of information feedback which they defined as the use of comparative information from statistical systems. These authors distinguished passive from active feedback where passive feedback was the provision of unsolicited information and active feedback engaged the interest of the clinician. They also assessed the impact of the recipient of the information, the format of the information and the timing of the feedback. Studies were included if their design used either a historical or a concurrent control group for comparison. The authors concluded that information feedback was most likely to influence clinical practice if the information was presented close to the time of decision-making and the clinicians had previously agreed to review their practice. The results of this review do not support or refute these conclusions. Axt-Adam and colleagues (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0184">Axt-Adam 1993</A>) reviewed 67 published papers of interventions (26 studies of feedback) designed to influence the ordering of diagnostic laboratory tests. They reported factors that could be important included the message, the provider of the feedback, the addressee, the timeliness and the vehicle. They concluded that there was considerable variation among different studies and that this variation could be explained in part by the extent, the timing, the frequency, and the availability of comparative information related to peers. They also felt that the practice setting was an important factor. Our findings support many of these conclusions. Buntinx and colleagues (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0015">Buntinx 1993</A>) conducted a systematic review of 26 studies of feedback and reminders to improve diagnostic and preventive care practices in primary care. They categorised the information provision that occurred after or during the target performance as feedback whereas information provision that occurred before the target performance was called reminders. Ten of the 26 studies used randomised designs but the quality of the included trials was not reported. The authors concluded that both feedback and reminders might reduce the use of diagnostic tests and improve the delivery of preventive care services. However, they also reported that it was not clear how feedback or reminders work, especially the use of peer group comparisons. Balas and colleagues (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000259/bibliography.html#CD000259-bbs2-0185">Balas 1996</A>) reviewed the effectiveness of peer-comparison feedback profiles in changing practice patterns. They located 12 eligible trials and concluded that profiling had a statistically significant but minimally important effect.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-04-22 12:19:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Audit and feedback can be effective in improving professional practice. The effects are generally small to moderate and vary based on the way the intervention is designed and delivered. As with any quality improvement strategy, efforts to change provider practice should be targeted at behaviours for which there is evidence between processes and patient outcomes.</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest that feedback may be more effective when baseline performance is low, when the source is a supervisor or senior colleague, when it is provided more than once, when it is provided both verbally and written, and when it includes both measurable targets and an action plan. In addition, the effect size varies based on the clinical behaviour targeted by the intervention. Although the quality of evidence for these findings is low, it is sensible to provide measurable targets and an action plan when this is practical, since this is unlikely to entail additional costs or harms. On the other hand, pragmatic consideration needs to be given to additional costs associated with providing feedback more frequently, providing both verbal and written feedback, and using a supervisor or colleague to provide feedback, since these features may entail additional costs while the benefit is not certain. The finding related to decreasing provider behaviours may suggest that feedback could be useful in situations where there is a desire to curb over-utilisation, keeping in mind that the source of the feedback should preferably be a senior colleague rather than the payor.</P>
<P>Audit is commonly used to improve accountability, either in the context of governance or as a feature of ongoing quality improvement efforts. The findings of this review suggest that it may be possible to increase the effect of feeding back the results of such audits on professional practice through careful attention to the way the feedback is designed and delivered. Those planning new interventions aiming to change practice should consider audit and feedback alongside other interventions and weigh the potential benefits against the potential challenges with respect to cost and/or logistics.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-27 12:16:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two main research audiences for this review: those who wish to implement and rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of a local audit and feedback intervention and those who wish to examine the underlying cognitions and behavioural control mechanisms that may explain how to best design and deliver these interventions. Like other reviews of quality improvement interventions, we have found limited progress over time in the knowledge of when and how to best conduct audit and feedback interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Flodgren-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodgren 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsetlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsetlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2008</LINK>). This suggests an opportunity for improved collaboration between the 'applied' scientists aiming to improve local quality of care and 'basic' scientists aiming to produce generalisable knowledge. In particular, each new audit and feedback intervention may provide an opportunity to incorporate evaluations of different ways of designing and/or delivering the feedback to explore how to optimise this intervention in routine practice settings. To build upon the current evidence base, the field would benefit from more attention to four areas: improved reporting and methods; explicit use of theory, empirical evidence, and logic to develop hypotheses and to design the intervention and comparison arms; a focus on professional practices for which there is compelling evidence of patient benefits with clearly defined primary outcomes; and more head-to-head trials (e.g. comparing different ways of providing feedback).</P>
<P>At a minimum, to contribute to the literature, trials need to be well-designed and clearly reported (<LINK REF="REF-Simera-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simera 2010</LINK>). Better reporting of study methods, targeted behaviours, characteristics of participants, and the context are needed (<LINK REF="REF-Davidoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidoff 2009</LINK>). A clear, thorough description of the intervention, ideally with illustrative examples would be useful. Primary outcomes should be important and clearly specified. The results should be adjusted for baseline differences, which are common in cluster-randomised trials, and the analysis should take account of the unit of allocation. Furthermore, trials need to be large enough to detect small effects (especially for changes in patient outcomes), when those effects are considered important.</P>
<P>The field would likely benefit if investigators explicitly built upon knowledge generated from prior trials, systematic reviews, and relevant theory to design audit and feedback interventions. In addition to some of the psychology literature referred to in the background section, the education and the organisational/management literature suggest how the design and delivery of feedback might be optimised to improve performance (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Shute-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shute 2008</LINK>). Well-designed, mixed methods process evaluations embedded within trials can be useful to explore and provide insights into the complex dynamics underlying the variable effectiveness of audit and feedback. In particular, researchers should examine hypotheses regarding how their audit and feedback intervention will be acted upon in practice.</P>
<P>Finally, although there have been more trials over time directly comparing different ways of conducting feedback interventions, there is a continued need to emphasise this type of head-to-head trial. The cumulated evidence suggests that further two-arm trials comparing feedback with usual care are likely to be of limited value. The focus should shift from whether audit and feedback works better than usual care<I> </I>to discerning ways to optimise the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions for particular contexts or clinical practices. The utility of future updates of this review will depend on the availability of new, well-designed (and well-reported) trials and on our ability to recognise, abstract, and analyse important explanatory factors.</P>

<P>1 - The effect of audit and feedback <I>alone</I> on professional practice was similar to audit and feedback as the core, essential feature in <I>multifaceted</I> interventions.</P>
<P>2 - The post-intervention risk differences are adjusted for pre-intervention differences between the comparison groups to account for baseline differences. The effect was weighted across studies by the number of health professionals involved in the study to ensure that small trials did not contribute as much to the estimate of effect as large trials.</P>
<P>3 - Many studies had more than two arms and therefore contributed multiple comparisons of audit and feedback versus usual care.</P>
<P>4 - We have downgraded the evidence from high to moderate because of inconsistency in the results that could not be fully explained.</P>
<P>5 - We have downgraded the evidence from moderate to low because of the limited number of trials targeting patient outcomes as a primary outcome.</P>

</P>
<P>The review has been updated primarily by using the EPOC register and pending file. We identified all articles in the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) register in January 2001 that had been coded as an RCT or clinical controlled trial (CCT) and as &#8217;audit and feedback&#8217;. The EPOC pending file (studies selected from the EPOC search strategy results and awaiting assessment) was also searched in January 2001 using the terms &#8217;audit&#8217; or &#8217;feedback&#8217;. In addition the previous MEDLINE strategy was used to search MEDLINE from January 1997 to April 2000 and any articles already identified by the EPOC strategy were excluded. This search did not generate any relevant additional articles and therefore was not repeated. The reference lists of new articles that were obtained were reviewed.</P>
<P>Previous searches built upon earlier reviews (Thomson 1995; Davis 1995; Oxman 1995; Davis 1992). We searched MEDLINE from January 1966 to June 1997 without language restrictions. These search terms were used: explode education, professional (tw), explode quality of health care, chart review: or quality assurance (tw), feedback (sh), audit (tw,sh) combined with these methodolological terms: clinical trial (pt), random allocation (sh), randomised controlled trials (sh), double-blind method (sh), single-blind method (sh), placebos (sh), all random: (tw). The Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education (RDRB/CME) (Davis 1991) was also searched. The reference lists of related systematic reviews and all articles obtained were reviewed.</P>
<P>An updated search was done in November 2002. Potentially relevant studies found with the updated search are included under References to studies awaiting assessment.</P>
