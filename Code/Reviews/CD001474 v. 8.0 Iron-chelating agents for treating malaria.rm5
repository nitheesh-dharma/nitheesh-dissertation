<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-16 16:04:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a major health problem that particularly affects people living in sub-Saharan Africa and other tropical parts of the world. It often causes considerable morbidity and high mortality, especially in children under five, and is passed by mosquito bites from infected female mosquitoes. Several drugs are available to treat malaria infections, and there are also additional drugs that can be used to increase effectiveness. Since parasites require iron to reproduce, drugs that withhold available iron (ie iron-chelating drugs) from the parasite could inhibit the parasite reproduction rate and may be used as adjuncts to traditional antimalarial drugs. However, the agents may also reduce the availability of iron to the individual, and this may contribute to or exacerbate anaemia. There are a number of different iron-chelating agents, such as desferrioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone, and all were considered in the review of trials, although DFO has to be given intravenously and so will be of little use in most malarious areas. The drugs may also display adverse effects like headaches, dizziness, muscle pain, and tiredness. The review found seven trials of DFO and deferiprone involving 570 participants. Although the drugs may have helped in part with parasite levels, there seemed to be adverse effects including concerns about possibility of an increase in death. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of iron-chelating agents as adjuncts in the treatment of malaria, and further trials are not expected.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-15 16:48:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It is still unclear whether iron-chelating agents, such as intravenous desferrioxamine (DFO) and oral deferiprone, given alone or added to standard antimalarial treatment would reduce malaria deaths.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate iron-chelating agents alone or combined with standard antimalarial drugs for treating <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>In May 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, <I>m</I>RCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing iron-chelating agents with placebo, or comparing iron-chelating agents plus standard antimalarial drugs with antimalarial drugs alone in adults or children with <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-04 15:15:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen J Smith">
<P>We independently applied inclusion criteria and assessed trial methodological quality, and one author extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with weighted mean differences (MD), and presented both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-04 15:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen J Smith">
<P>Seven trials involving 570 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two small trials compared DFO with placebo (plus standard antimalarial drugs in both groups). No evidence of benefit or harm was shown in relation to death, but the trials were small (435 participants). The risk of experiencing persistent seizures was lower with DFO compared with placebo (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.95; 334 participants, 1 trial), but adverse effects were more common with DFO. One small trial involving 45 adults and children compared deferiprone with placebo (plus standard antimalarial drugs in both groups). Participants in the deferiprone group had significantly faster coma recovery (MD -27 h, 95% CI -34.20 to -19.80) and parasite clearance (MD -24 h, 95% CI -35.27 to -12.73). No adverse effects were reported for this trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-15 16:48:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are insufficient data to draw any conclusions for DFO and deferiprone. There are nonsignificant trends towards fewer seizures but overall harm (death) with DFO, and results from one small trial of deferiprone suggest shorter coma recovery and parasite clearance.</P>
<P>2008: We do not plan to update this review given the paucity of recent trials in this area and other priorities in malaria treatment research.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 13:45:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-15 13:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each year one to two million people die from malaria, with half of these deaths occurring among children infected with the <I>Plasmodium falciparum </I>malaria parasite in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Wyler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Cerebral malaria is the commonest fatal syndrome of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria, and mortality can be as high as 50% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Death and sequelae occur even in people treated with antimalarial drugs, and researchers are exploring the effects of adding treatments to the main antimalarial regimens in an effort to reduce mortality.</P>
<P>Iron chelation is one potential adjuvant treatment. The biological rationale for iron chelation is that malaria parasites require iron to reproduce, so drugs that withhold available iron from the malaria parasite could inhibit its reproduction rate (<LINK REF="REF-Wyler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mabeza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabeza 1996</LINK>). Other indirect evidence of a potential effect comes from experimental studies that suggest iron supplementation exacerbates malaria infection (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 1984</LINK>), and observational studies that have led the authors to conclude that iron deficiency is protective (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raventos-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raventos 1982</LINK>). Theory also suggests that iron-chelation therapy may accelerate coma recovery by inhibiting iron-induced damage to brain cells, thus protecting against damage to the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Mabeza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabeza 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Desferrioxamine (DFO) is the standard iron-chelating agent in clinical use. It works by entering malaria parasites and combining (chelating) with available iron (<LINK REF="REF-Hider-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hider 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lytton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lytton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mabeza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabeza 1996</LINK>). It is generally regarded as a safe drug despite known adverse effects (eg neutropenia, haematological toxicity, transient headaches, dizziness, myalgia, and malaise) and reports of serious auditory and visual neurotoxicities in long-term therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1996</LINK>). However, it is considered of little use in most malarious areas because it is expensive, has to be given intravenously, and penetrates infected red blood cells slowly (<LINK REF="REF-Wyler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hershko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hershko 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other iron-chelating agents are being considered, such as the orally active deferiprone. However, before iron-chelating agents are used as adjuvant treatments for malaria, it is important to assess that their antimalarial action is complementary and not antagonistic to standard therapy. In vitro and animal experiments suggest that iron-chelating agents and artemisinin-class antimalarial drugs might be less effective when used simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Meshnick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meshnick 1993</LINK>). Therefore, studies of iron chelator and artemisinin drugs used together will be carefully scrutinized to detect any inhibitory effects of the iron chelator on the action of artemisinin.</P>

The intervention group in the <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-i</LINK> received deferiprone (75 mg/kg/day) divided into doses given every eight hours for an initial 72-hour period. In <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-ii</LINK>, deferiprone (100 mg/kg/day) was administered every six hours for 96 hours.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>

<LINK REF="STD-Gordeuk-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordeuk 1992b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998a</LINK> reported median time to coma recovery; they treated the data as continuous and implied a skewed data set, which meant that we could not include these in meta-analyses. We contacted the trial authors, and <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998a</LINK> provided the mean and standard deviation for survivors; the mean was less than the standard deviation in each treatment group, thus confirming the skewed nature of the data. Time to coma recovery constitutes time-to-event data and should be analysed as such. To pool the results from both trials requires log-hazard ratios, which give a measure of treatment effect. We contacted the trial authors for this information when the review was first prepared (1999), but we have not received these additional data.</P>

<P>Both trials reported on deaths, and <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998a</LINK> was stopped early on the recommendation of the safety and data monitoring committee since more were reported in the DFO group. While trials stopped early can sometimes introduce bias if due to a trend in the results of a spurious study, in this trial, however, the risk of death was significantly increased in the DFO group (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.89; 352 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), therefore systematic error is unlikely.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-15 13:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strength of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We identified only seven trials of iron-chelating agents used in conjunction with standard antimalarial drugs (three trials) or as single agents (four trials). The strength of evidence is affected by the small sample sizes used; any effect would have to be dramatic to detect a difference between the treatment groups. Concealment of allocation was inadequate in four of the included trials, which increases the likelihood of selection bias and exaggerated estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Poor graphical presentation of continuous data meant interpretation of results for some outcomes was difficult.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Is death less likely in those treated with iron-chelating agents?</HEADING>
<P>The available evidence from one trial of people with severe malaria suggests that DFO is harmful (<LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998a</LINK>), while the other trial suggests there is no adverse or beneficial effect of DFO (<LINK REF="STD-Gordeuk-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordeuk 1992b</LINK>). To address the inconsistent evidence of the effect of DFO on death will require further large randomized trials of people, but justification for such trials will depend on a belief of potential benefit from iron-chelating agents.</P>
<P>One trial of deferiprone found fewer deaths in the deferiprone group (<LINK REF="STD-Mohanty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mohanty 2002</LINK>), but the difference was not statistically or clinically significant because of the small number of study participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Does adjunctive iron-chelation therapy shorten coma recovery time?</HEADING>
<P>It is inappropriate to comment on the effect of DFO on coma recovery since the available results were reported as continuous data. In one trial of deferiprone for people with symptomatic malaria, coma recovery was significantly faster in the deferiprone group (<LINK REF="STD-Mohanty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mohanty 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are persistent seizures less likely with adjunctive DFO treatment?</HEADING>
<P>The results from one trial indicate that adjunctive DFO treatment has a significant association with a reduction in the incidence of persistent seizures in children less than six years old with severe malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Do iron-chelating agents have an effect on parasitaemia?</HEADING>
<P>The results are inconclusive for people with severe malaria. Trialists need to report parasitaemia effects in a consistent way to allow data to be pooled.</P>
<P>In trials of DFO alone versus placebo in people with asymptomatic malaria, means and standard error of the means were reported for parasite concentration. The evidence indicates that participants treated with DFO experienced a significant decrease in mean parasite concentration compared to those taking placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>Two trials of deferiprone in people with asymptomatic malaria reported means and standard error of the means for parasite concentrations. The results showed no evidence of an effect on parasitaemia. To detect even a 40% reduction in parasites would require at least eight participants in each arm of the 75 mg/kg trial and 11 in each arm of the 100 mg/kg trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-ii</LINK>). The actual numbers used were much smaller. The investigators proposed that, given the low numbers, it is possible the antimalarial effect of deferiprone was not found due to a type II error.</P>
<P>In one trial of deferiprone in people with <I>P. falciparum</I> infection and fever (<LINK REF="STD-Mohanty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mohanty 2002</LINK>), mean time to parasite clearance was significantly faster in the deferiprone group, but it is difficult to determine clinical significance from the small number of study participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What are the adverse effects associated with iron-chelating agents?</HEADING>
<P>Hypoglycaemia, phlebitis, and swelling and pain at the site of needle insertion were observed in the DFO trials. All these effects were more common in the participants treated with DFO, but due to the small numbers randomized in the trials we cannot comment on the clinical significance of these results. It should be noted that in one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Gordeuk-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordeuk 1992a</LINK>, participants were questioned regarding adverse effects twice daily, but facilities for thoroughly assessing auditory and visual neurotoxicities were not available. Such effects have been detected in patients receiving long-term DFO therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1996</LINK>), but the trial authors suggested the short-term nature of this trial probably lessens the risk of such complications. Therefore, until further trials can confirm that neurological adverse effects are not associated with DFO therapy, adverse effect data should be regarded as incomplete and interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Headaches and dizziness occurred more frequently in those receiving deferiprone compared to placebo. Abdominal pain, myalgia, and malaise did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Neutropenia has been observed in other studies of deferiprone (75 to 100 mg/kg/day or more), but only in iron-overloaded patients over a long period (<LINK REF="REF-Berdoukas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berdoukas 1993</LINK>). Another adverse effect associated with deferiprone is haematological toxicity, which may be idiosyncratic (<LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-1998b_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 1998b-ii</LINK>). No data were available for these effects in trials of deferiprone in malaria, which signifies the need to confirm (in future trials) whether or not persons treated with this iron-chelating agent are likely to experience such effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Trials of iron-chelating agents as adjunctive treatments for malaria were prompted by the fact that cerebral malaria remains a major cause of death in African children despite treatment with standard antimalarial drugs. All trials included in this review, except one small trial in India, were conducted in Zambia. This limits our ability to comment on the wider relevance of iron-chelating agents to populations in other malarious areas.</P>
<P>Trials of DFO in malaria do show positive (but not statistically significant) results; however, it may not be the ideal iron-chelating agent for use in malaria. Parenteral administration is required due to the poor absorption of DFO, so its use is unlikely in uncomplicated malaria or areas where equipment is not readily available. The drug is also expensive and requires continuous administration for optimal effectiveness, limiting its use in most malarious areas of Africa and Asia.</P>

<P>In view of the tendency in one trial for DFO to be associated with more deaths, and given the paucity of recent trials in this area (most recent trial published in 2002) and other priorities in malaria treatment research, new trials in this area are unlikely and we do not plan to update this review.</P>

<P>In an initial toxicity check, 13 patients were treated with artesunate alone (2.4 mg/kg by intravenous, then 1.2 mg/kg by intravenous every 12 h for 8 doses) or the same regimen of artesunate plus desferrioxamine (DFO) continuous infusion over 72 h. Once it was clear little toxicity was occurring, another 18 patients were treated similarly in a randomized single-blind trial. However, because the initial 13 patients had similar baseline characteristics to the subsequent 18 patients, the results were combined. Thus 2 data sets are combined, but 1 is the result of a nonrandomized study</P>
