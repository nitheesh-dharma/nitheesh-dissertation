<P>
<B>What are surgical site infections and who is at risk?</B>
</P>
<P>The inadvertent transfer of micro-organisms such as bacteria to a patient's wound site during surgery can result in a wound infection that is commonly called a surgical site infection (SSI). SSIs are one of the most common forms of health care-associated infections for surgical patients. Around 1 in 20 surgical patients develop an SSI in hospital, and this proportion rises when people go home. SSIs result in delayed wound healing, increased hospital stays, increased use of antibiotics, unnecessary pain and, in extreme cases, the death of the patient, so their prevention is a key aim for health services.</P>
<P>
<B>Why use hand antisepsis prior to surgery?</B>
</P>
<P>There are many different points in the care pathway where prevention of SSIs can take place. This includes antiseptic cleansing of the hands for those who are operating on the patient. Surgical hand antisepsis is the focus of this review. The two most common forms of hand antisepsis involve aqueous scrubs and alcohol rubs. Aqueous scrubs are water-based solutions containing antiseptic ingredients such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine. Scrubbing involves wetting the hands and forearms with water, systematically applying an aqueous scrub solution using either hands or sponges, rinsing under running water and then repeating this process. Alcohol solutions containing additional active ingredients are used to perform an 'alcohol rub'. Surgical teams systematically apply the alcohol rub solutions to their hands and allow it to evaporate. Alcohol is effective against a wide range of bacteria and other micro-organisms. Following hand antisepsis, operating staff then put on gloves, which provide an important barrier between operating staff and the patient; however, because gloves can become perforated during surgery, it is necessary to have hands as germ-free as possible.</P>
<P>
<B>What we found</B>
</P>
<P>In June 2015 we searched for as many relevant studies that had a robust design (randomised controlled trials) as we could find and compared different types of hand antisepsis before surgery. We included 14 studies that compared a range of methods for performing surgical hand antisepsis. The two measures used to assess the effectiveness of treatments were the number of cases of SSIs in patients (presented in four included studies) and the number of viable bacteria or fungal cells (known as colony-forming units, or CFUs) on the hand of the person operating before surgery and after surgery (which is a way of counting the bacteria present on the skin surface). It is not clear whether the method of hand antisepsis influences the risk of SSI, as most of the studies were too small and had flaws. There was some evidence that hand antisepsis with chlorhexidine may reduce the number of bacteria on the hands of health professionals compared with povidone iodine. Importantly, we do not know what the number of CFUs on the hands tells us about the likelihood of patients developing SSIs. There was also some evidence that alcohol rubs with additional antiseptic ingredients may reduce CFUs compared with aqueous scrubs.</P>

<P>Fourteen trials were included in the updated review. Four trials reported the primary outcome, rates of SSIs, while 10 trials reported number of CFUs but not SSI rates.

<B>SSIs</B>
</P>
<P>One study randomised 3317 participants to basic hand hygiene (soap and water) versus an alcohol rub plus additional hydrogen peroxide.

<P>One study (500 participants) compared alcohol-only rub versus an aqueous scrub and found no clear evidence of a difference in the risk of SSI (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.34, very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias).</P>
<P>One study (4387 participants) compared alcohol rubs with additional active ingredients versus aqueous scrubs and found no clear evidence of a difference in SSI (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48, low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias).</P>
<P>One study (100 participants) compared an alcohol rub with an additional ingredient versus an aqueous scrub with a brush and found no evidence of a difference in SSI (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.34, low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision).</P>
<P>
<B>CFUs</B>
</P>
<P>The review presents results for a number of comparisons; key findings include the following.</P>
<P>Four studies compared different aqueous scrubs in reducing CFUs on hands.Three studies found chlorhexidine gluconate scrubs resulted in fewer CFUs than povidone iodine scrubs immediately after scrubbing, 2 hours after the initial scrub and 2 hours after subsequent scrubbing. All evidence was low or very low quality, with downgrading typically for imprecision and indirectness of outcome. One trial comparing a chlorhexidine gluconate scrub versus a povidone iodine plus triclosan scrub found no clear evidence of a difference&#8212;this was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness of outcome).</P>
<P>Four studies compared aqueous scrubs versus alcohol rubs containing additional active ingredients and reported CFUs. In three comparisons there was evidence of fewer CFUs after using alcohol rubs with additional active ingredients (moderate or very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome). Evidence from one study suggested that an aqueous scrub was more effective in reducing CFUs than an alcohol rub containing additional ingredients, but this was very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome.</P>
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of different scrub durations varied. Four studies compared the effect of different durations of scrubs and rubs on the number of CFUs on hands. There was evidence that a 3 minute scrub reduced the number of CFUs compared with a 2 minute scrub (very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome). Data on other comparisons were not consistent, and interpretation was difficult. All further evidence was low or very low quality (typically downgraded for imprecision and indirectness).</P>
<P>One study compared the effectiveness of using nail brushes and nail picks under running water prior to a chlorhexidine scrub on the number of CFUs on hands. It was unclear whether there was a difference in the effectiveness of these different techniques in terms of the number of CFUs remaining on hands (very low quality evidence downgraded due to imprecision and indirectness).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-21 16:57:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no firm evidence that one type of hand antisepsis is better than another in reducing SSIs. Chlorhexidine gluconate scrubs may reduce the number of CFUs on hands compared with povidone iodine scrubs; however, the clinical relevance of this surrogate outcome is unclear. Alcohol rubs with additional antiseptic ingredients may reduce CFUs compared with aqueous scrubs. With regard to duration of hand antisepsis, a 3 minute initial scrub reduced CFUs on the hand compared with a 2 minute scrub, but this was very low quality evidence, and findings about a longer initial scrub and subsequent scrub durations are not consistent. It is unclear whether nail picks and brushes have a differential impact on the number of CFUs remaining on the hand. Generally, almost all evidence available to inform decisions about hand antisepsis approaches that were explored here were informed by low or very low quality evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The inadvertent transfer of micro-organisms to patients' wound sites during surgery can result in postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs). SSIs are one of the most common forms of healthcare-associated infections for surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Around 5% of surgical patients develop an SSI (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>), though this incidence can double when surveillance includes active postdischarge follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Leaper-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaper 2015</LINK>). SSIs result in delayed wound healing, increased hospital stays, increased use of antibiotics, unnecessary pain and, in extreme cases, the death of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Micro-organisms that cause SSIs come from a variety of sources within the operating room, including the hands of the surgical team. Members of the surgical team wear sterile gloves to prevent transferring bacteria from their hands to patients. However, gloves can become perforated during surgery, so it is necessary to have hands as germ-free as possible. This is achieved by conducting surgical hand antisepsis immediately before donning sterile gloves prior to commencing surgical or invasive procedures. While handwashing removes transient micro-organisms, surgical hand antisepsis goes a step further to inhibit the growth of resident microorganisms, thereby minimising the risk of a patient developing an SSI (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).This is achieved using antiseptic agents that kill and inhibit bacteria, fungi, protozoa and bacterial spores. An ideal antiseptic agent would be fast-acting, persistent (effective for a number of hours), cumulative (repeated exposure inhibits bacterial growth for a number of days), have a broad spectrum of activity and be safe to use.There are several individual components of surgical hand antisepsis, including the pre-wash; the application technique; the use of sponges, brushes or nail picks; the choice of antiseptic solution and the duration of the antisepsis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Defining terms - scrub and rubs</HEADING>
<P>Several different terms are used when describing surgical hand antisepsis. Antisepsis with running water and an aqueous solution is referred to as a surgical or a traditional scrub. Antisepsis with an alcohol solution is referred to as an alcohol rub or a waterless scrub. In this review, we understand surgical hand antisepsis to encompass both methods of surgical antisepsis: scrubbing and rubbing. The very first antisepsis of the day is referred to as the initial antisepsis. Scrubs or rubs performed thereafter but on the same day are referred to as subsequent antisepses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Surgical hand antisepsis - current practice</HEADING>
<P>The Association for Perioperative Practice (AfPP) recommends a pre-wash prior to the first antisepsis of the day, when hands are washed with soap or an antimicrobial solution under running water (<LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK>). The function of the pre-wash is to remove dirt (organic material). <LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK> then recommends cleaning nails using a pick under running water. Clinicians can then perform antisepsis using either an antimicrobial solution with running water, referred to as a traditional scrub, or an alcoholic rub without water. <LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK> suggests alcohol rubs are more effective in reducing bacteria on the skin but should not be used if there is visible dirt present. The AfPP does not cite any specific antimicrobial solution as being the most effective, but, like many other organisations, recommends that the solution chosen meets the ideal properties for an antimicrobial solution (<LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AORN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). These properties are identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the solution being:</P>
<UL>
<LI>fast-acting;</LI>
<LI>persistent (effective for a number of hours);</LI>
<LI>cumulative (repeated exposure inhibits bacterial growth for a number of days);</LI>
<LI>having a broad spectrum of activity; and</LI>
<LI>safe to use (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK> recommends a duration of 2 to 5 minutes (depending on manufacturers instructions) for a traditional scrub, but does not provide details on the recommended duration of an alcoholic rub. There is some discrepancy regarding aspects of hand antisepsis between different organisations. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses (ACORN) only recommend a pre-wash if hands are visibly dirty (<LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>), and <LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK> recommends that the first scrub of the day last 5 minutes while subsequent scrubs last 3 minutes. Nail brushes no longer appear to be recommended as these can damage skin (<LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AORN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Guidelines for surgical antisepsis also cover topics such as rings, artificial nails and nail polish (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HIS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HIS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). The impact of these factors on SSI is the focus of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 2014</LINK>). There are concerns that hand antisepsis causes skin damage to staff hands and that some products are more abrasive than others (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1986b</LINK>). This topic is outside the remit of this review.</P>

<P>Solutions for hand antisepsis are either aqueous (water) based or alcohol based.<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aqueous scrubs</HEADING>
<P>Aqueous scrubs are water based solutions containing active ingredients that are used during traditional handscrubs. The most common solutions contain chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine (see below). Scrubbing involves wetting the hands and forearms with water, systematically applying an aqueous scrub solution using either hands or sponges, rinsing under running water and then repeating the process.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alcohol rubs</HEADING>
<P>Alcohol-based solutions are used to perform an 'alcohol rub'. Health professionals apply the solution to dry hands and then rub them together systematically before allowing the solution to evaporate. Alcohol rubs do not require water for their application. Some alcohol rub solutions contain additional active antiseptic agents.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antiseptic agents</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alcohol</HEADING>
<P>Alcohols have little or no residual effect, and the concentration rather than the type of alcohol is thought to be most important in determining its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1995</LINK>). Alcohol rubs are usually available in preparations of 60% to 90% strength and are effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram negative bacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and many fungi and viruses. The three main alcohols used are ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol, and some rubs may contain a mixture of these. Compared with other common antiseptic products, alcohol is associated with the most rapid and greatest reduction in microbial counts (<LINK REF="STD-Lowbury-1974a" TYPE="STUDY">Lowbury 1974a</LINK>), but it does not remove surface dirt as it does not contain surfactants or have a foaming action (<LINK REF="STD-Hobson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hobson 1998</LINK>). Alcohol-based solutions usually (but not always) contain additional active ingredients to combine the rapid bacteriocidal effect of alcohol with more persistent chemical activity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Iodine and iodophors</HEADING>
<P>Iodine has mostly been replaced by iodophors, as iodine often causes irritation and discolouring of skin. Iodophors are composed of elemental iodine, iodide or triiodide, and a polymer carrier of high molecular weight (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Combining iodine with various polymers increases the solubility of iodine, promotes sustained release of iodine and reduces skin irritation. Iodophors are effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram negative bacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi and viruses (<LINK REF="STD-Joress-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Joress 1962</LINK>). Iodophors contain iodine with a carrier such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). PVP, also known as povidone, is a polymer that detoxifies and prolongs the activities of drugs. PVP prolongs the activity of iodine by releasing it slowly. A combination of PVP and iodine, known as povidone iodine (PI), is less irritating than earlier solutions of iodine tincture (<LINK REF="STD-Joress-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Joress 1962</LINK>). Iodophors rapidly reduce transient and colonising bacteria but have little or no residual effect (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chlorhexidine</HEADING>
<P>Chlorhexidine is a biguanide. It is effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, lipophilic viruses and yeasts (<LINK REF="STD-Hibbard-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Hibbard 2002a</LINK>). It is not sporicidal. Although its immediate antimicrobial activity is slower than that of alcohols, it is more persistent because it binds to the outermost layer of skin, the stratum corneum (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1990</LINK>). Over time, repeated exposure can lead to a cumulative effect where both transient and resident organisms are reduced (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1990</LINK>). Chlorhexidine gluconate is effective in the presence of blood and other protein-rich biological materials (<LINK REF="STD-Hibbard-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Hibbard 2002a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quaternary ammonium compounds</HEADING>
<P>Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are composed of a nitrogen atom linked to four alkyl groups. Alkyl benzalkonium chlorides are the most widely used as antiseptics, though other compounds include benzethonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridium chloride. QACs are primarily bacteriostatic and fungistatic, although they are microbicidal against some organisms at high concentrations.They are more active against gram-positive bacteria than against gram-negative bacilli. QACs have relatively weak activity against mycobacteria and fungi and greater activity against lipophilic viruses. Their antimicrobial activity is adversely affected by the presence of organic material, and they are not compatible with anionic detergents. In 1994, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) tentatively classified benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride as having insufficient data to classify as safe and effective for use as an antiseptic handwash (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hexachlorophene</HEADING>
<P>Hexachlorophene is a halophenol compound. It is a slow-acting antiseptic that forms a film over the skin (<LINK REF="STD-Crowder-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Crowder 1967</LINK>). The film retains bacteriostatic properties and is effective against gram-positive bacteria but is less effective with gram-negative bacteria and fungi (<LINK REF="STD-Crowder-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Crowder 1967</LINK>). A report of toxicity in neonates led to restricted usage (<LINK REF="REF-Kimborough-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimborough 1973</LINK>), and today, hexachlorophene has mostly been replaced by triclosan.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Triclosan</HEADING>
<P>Triclosan (2,4,4'&#8211;trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) has been incorporated in detergents (0.4% to 1%) and alcohols (0.2% to 0.5%) used for hygienic and surgical hand antisepsis or preoperative skin disinfection. It inhibits staphylococci, coliforms, enterobacteria and a wide range of gram-negative intestinal and skin flora (<LINK REF="STD-Bartzokas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bartzokas 1983</LINK>). Most strains of pseudomonas are resistant, and triclosan has only fair activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis and poor activity against fungi (<LINK REF="STD-Faoagali-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Faoagali 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chloroxylenol</HEADING>
<P>Chloroxylenol, also known as para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX), is a halogen-substituted phenolic compound. It is not as quick-acting as chlorhexidine or iodophors, and its residual activity is less pronounced than that observed with chlorhexidine gluconate (<LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 1999</LINK>). In 1994, the FDA TFM tentatively classified chloroxylenol as having insufficient data to classify as safe and effective (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-23 17:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). In this review we recorded issues with unit of analysis, for example where a cluster trial had been undertaken but analysed at the individual level in the study report. We assessed blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of outcome data for each of the review outcomes separately. For this review, we anticipated that blinding of participants (surgical staff) may not be possible. For this reason the assessment of the risk of detection bias focused on whether trials reported blinded outcome assessment (because wound infection can be a subjective outcome, it can be at high risk of measurement bias when outcome assessment is not blinded).</P>
<P>We presented our assessment of risk of bias using two 'Risk of bias' summary figures; one which is a summary of bias for each item across all studies, and a second which shows a cross-tabulation of each trial by all of the risk of bias items. We summarised a study's risk of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-11-23 12:54:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were entered into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Continuous outcomes (i.e. CFUs) were reported as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Dichotomous outcomes (i.e. SSIs) were presented as risks ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We reported findings narratively and considered pooling of data after exploring clinical and statistical heterogeneity. We examined clinical heterogeneity by looking at the type of intervention, the participant population and the type of surgery. For assessment of statistical and related heterogeneity we used I<SUP>2</SUP> values (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> examines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Very broadly, we considered that I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 25%, or less, may mean a low level of heterogeneity <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>, and values of more than 75%, or more, indicate very high heterogeneity.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Handling of data where the appropriateness of the analysis reported in the paper was unclear.</HEADING>
<P>Where the trial had a cross-over design or was cluster-randomised but the analysis did not appear to take this into account, we reported the available raw data (e.g. mean values) as well as the effect estimate calculated in the paper and discussed the likely effect of an incorrect analysis on the effect estimate.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>In the update, in line with current Cochrane methods, we planned to present the main results of the review in &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables where we had pooled data. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined and the sum of available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>). We planned to present the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison.</P>

<P>We present an overview of included studies and comparisons in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified and included 14 eligible trials in this review. Four trials reported the primary outcome, namely SSI (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergara_x002d_Fernandez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergara-Fernandez 2010</LINK>). The remaining 10 trials reported the number of CFUs (on the hands of the surgical team), which is a surrogate outcome that is thought to give an impression of the likelihood of infection. All 14 trials took place in operating departments, with 8 studies involving surgery and 6 testing interventions in surgical staff but without surgery taking place. Of the included studies, four compared different durations of scrubs or rubs (<LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the included studies had complicated designs: <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK> was an equivalence, cluster, cross-over trial where the unit of randomisation was the surgical service. Each surgical service carried out one intervention for one month and then switched to the alternative intervention the following month. <LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK> also used a cluster, cross-over design, whereby operating theatres were allocated to an intervention with cross-over every two months. We also considered <LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK> to be a cluster trial, as it randomised four surgeons to different antisepsis methods which they used prior to surgery on multiple participants. Seven other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pietsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>) were also cross-over trials.</P>

<P>We summarise our 'Risk of bias' assessment in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and in the 'Risk of bias' assessment tables. Overall, most studies were at unclear risk or high risk of bias for one of the following: selection bias, detection bias and attrition bias. Only two studies were at low risk of bias for all these (<LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We considered four studies to be at low risk of detection bias, as they blinded outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2009</LINK>).

<P>We also judged two studies to be at high risk of attrition bias. <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK> reported that 9/32 randomised members of staff failed to complete with no reasons given for withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK> excluded 100 of 600 patients from the analysis for reasons such as their condition was revised on subsequent histopathological examination, they had incomplete forms, or they "failed follow-up".</P>
<P>We judged several studies to be at unclear risk of other bias due to uncertainty as to whether a cluster-randomised or cross-over design had been taken into account in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK> were at unclear risk of other bias as a cluster design was detected but it did not seem that clustering had been taken into account in the analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK> were at unclear risk because it appeared that the crossover designs had not been taken into consideration in the analyses.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK> compared soap and water with an alcohol rub which contained hydrogen peroxide as an additional active ingredient. Surgeons in both groups scrubbed with soap and water for 4 to 5 minutes before the first procedure of the day and subsequently if there was visible soiling. For subsequent procedures, surgeons were randomised in clusters based on operating theatre to soap and water or 7 to 10 ml of a locally produced hand rub based on isopropyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide, which they applied for 3 minutes and kept wet. The trial used a total of 10 clusters, each defined by six operating theatres, across five two-month intervals, with cross-over after each two-month period. The trial included 3317 patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgery and assessed SSI at 30 days using modified CDC definitions. There appeared to be a low risk of bias for all domains except the blinding of participants and personnel, which would have been difficult to achieve. Trialists accounted for both the clustering and cross-over in the power calculation and in the analyses.</P>

Control of the order of interventions was through a Latin square design. Investigators took hand bacterial samples immediately after the initial scrub, 2 hours after the initial scrub and 2 hours after the subsequent scrub.

However, overall this is low or very low quality evidence, and the number of CFUs is a surrogate outcome for SSI. Some of the studies included appeared to have been incorrectly analysed and one was at high risk of attrition bias.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK> compared a 5 minute scrub using either 4% povidone iodine (Betadine) or 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiscrub) versus a 5 minute handrub using 75% propanol-1, propanol-2 with mecetronium ethylsulphate (Sterillium). Participants in the aqueous scrub group could choose between chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine solutions. Participants in the handrubbing group carried out a single handwash for 1 minute with non-antiseptic soap at the start of each day. The entire scrub team in each of six hospitals took part. The trial included 4387 consecutive patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgery and assessed SSI at 30 d using the CDC definition. The study was an equivalence, cluster cross-over trial but did not appear to have accounted for the clustering in the analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Vergara_x002d_Fernandez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergara-Fernandez 2010</LINK> compared an aqueous scrub with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (which involved the use of a brush and a sponge) versus a handrub using 61% ethyl alcohol plus 1% chlorhexidine gluconate. Mean duration of the aqueous scrub was 3.9 minutes (SD 1.07), and mean duration of the alcohol rub was 2.0 minutes (SD 0.47). This trial took place in a single institution and involved 400 staff operating on 100 patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgery, who were randomised to the two hand antisepsis groups. Investigators assessed SSI at one month using the CDC definition. Twenty per cent of the included staff had hand samples sent for microbiological examination, and samples were assessed as positive or negative for hand cultures.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review.</P>
<P>Only four trials reported risk of surgical site infection (SSI), the primary outcome for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergara_x002d_Fernandez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergara-Fernandez 2010</LINK>). These results were inconclusive, and it is not clear whether any method of hand antisepsis is any more effective than another in reducing subsequent SSI. Most of the evidence was of low or very low quality, mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision. Most of the studies were too small to detect a difference in SSI rates even if one existed.</P>
<P>The remaining 10 trials measured the number of CFUs on hands. Where trials were cluster and/or crossover trials they were often not analysed correctly, which may impact on the precision of estimates.</P>
<P>In four comparisons of aqueous scrub solutions containing chlorhexidine versus those containing povidone iodine, (three studies) there was evidence that chlorhexidine-gluconate containing scrubs reduce numbers of CFU on the hands more than povidone iodine (<LINK REF="STD-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furukawa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>). The evidence was of low or very low quality. High levels of heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Results of studies comparing alcohol rubs with aqueous scrubs were mixed. In three comparisons (two studies) alcohol rubs containing additional active ingredients were found to be more effective than aqueous scrubs in reducing the number of CFUs on hands (moderate and very low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pietsch 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2007</LINK> reported no difference between povidone iodine scrubs and ethyl alcohol based rubs of 61% and 70% (very low quality evidence). <LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK> found chlorhexidine aqueous scrubs more effective than chlorhexidine in alcohol rubs (very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>In terms of the duration of hand antisepsis, there was evidence that a 3 minute scrub reduced the number of CFUs compared to a 2 minute scrub (<LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>) (very low quality evidence). Data on other comparisons were not consistent, and interpretation is difficult.</P>
<P>One three-arm trial assessed the use of a disposable nail pick or disposable nail brush under running water prior to scrubbing with chlorhexidine and found no clear difference in the number of CFUs (very low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>, which found no difference in SSIs when comparing surgical hand antisepsis with basic hand hygiene (moderate quality evidence), has interesting implications for practice, which warrant further research.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-21 16:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical hand antisepsis is carried out to reduce the number of bacteria on the hands of the surgical team so that in the event of a breach in glove barrier protection, the risk of transferring infections to patients is reduced. Therefore, the most appropriate outcome measure for a study of surgical hand antisepsis is postoperative SSI. Only four studies used this measure (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nthumba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nthumba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergara_x002d_Fernandez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergara-Fernandez 2010</LINK>), while the remaining 10 trials measured CFUs. It is widely assumed that interventions reducing CFUs may impact on incidence of SSIs but there is little evidence to support this assertion. There was considerable variation in the timing of outcome assessment for measuring CFUs as well as some differences in the methods used to obtain samples.</P>
<P>All of the studies included in this review were underpowered in terms of small sample sizes, a limited number of outcome events or both. RCTs need to be adequately powered so that they are able to detect treatment effects of a specified size if they exist, and sample size calculations should be used to help estimate the number of people recruited to a trial. Evidence from limited numbers of participants and/or where limited numbers of events occur can also lead to confidence intervals that are fragile (that is not stable) which is also likely to have been a risk for all comparisons here.</P>
<P>A key issue with the included studies was the incorrect or unclear analysis and presentation of cross-over and cluster data. When these methods are used, correct planning, conduct and reporting are vital to maximise the value of the research. Cross-over studies involve an individual receiving more than one of the treatments of interest, with the randomisation consisting of the sequence in which these are received. The analysis requires statistical tests that take the paired nature of these data into account. If investigators do not use these approaches, they may overestimate standard errors, leading to confidence intervals which are less precise than they might be - that is, there is a risk of a type II error (concluding no significant difference when there is one). Cluster trials, where allocation of treatment is made at a group level and the unit of assessment is at the individual level, require careful planning and analysis to avoid producing artificially small standard errors which can lead to type I errors - that is, finding a statistical significant difference when one does not exist.</P>

<P>We attempted to overcome potential publication bias through rigorous searching. We had two studies translated, one from German and one from Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergara_x002d_Fernandez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergara-Fernandez 2010</LINK>).

However the addition of these new studies did not result in a change to the findings of the earlier review.</P>
<P>We identified two other systematic reviews of surgical hand antisepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK>). We discussed <LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK> in the earlier version of this Cochrane review, but <LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK>, published in 2012, is new to this update. <LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK> included 23 studies and two systematic reviews (the previous version of this Cochrane review and <LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK>), focusing on traditional scrubs versus alcohol rubs. It included randomised trials, non-randomised trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, descriptive studies and case reports. <LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK> included six randomised studies which fell within the search dates of this update review but are excluded from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hobson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hobson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulberry-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulberry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rotter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rotter 2006</LINK>); <LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK> also included one unpublished study that we were unable to retrieve (<LINK REF="REF-Sigler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigler 2001</LINK>). However, we did include three of the same randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pietsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pietsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Goncalves-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goncalves 2012</LINK> concluded that alcohol preparations can replace traditional scrubs using aqueous chlorhexidine or iodine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK> was published in 2006 and includes three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bryce-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bryce 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>). This Cochrane review update also included <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK> but excluded <LINK REF="STD-Bryce-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bryce 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Larson-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2001b</LINK>, as they were not randomised. <LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK> failed to identify six of the eight trials published before 2006 that were included in this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="STD-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furukawa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pietsch 2001</LINK>), and they excluded <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK> because it measured SSIs rather than CFUs. <LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2006</LINK> draws two conclusions: that surgical handrubs using alcohol-based products are more effective than 6 minute scrubs using 4% chlorhexidine, and that there is no evidence that a 2 minute scrub is more effective than a 3 minute scrub using 4% chlorhexidine.</P>
<P>Guidelines for hand antisepsis have changed slightly since the first version of this Cochrane review was published. The main changes are the increasing status of alcohol rubs, which are now considered to have equal standing to traditional scrubs and are acceptable alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>); and the use of brushes which has been downgraded from not necessary to not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The conclusions one can draw from the evidence in this review are limited for the following reasons. Ten of the 14 trials included in this review measured CFUs rather than SSIs (<LINK REF="STD-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furukawa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kappstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kappstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pereira-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pietsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>). Two of these trials used the finger press method rather than the recognised standard glove juice test (<LINK REF="STD-Hajipour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajipour 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herruzo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herruzo 2000</LINK>). Sample sizes are small in most of the trials. In three trials, participants in the scrub group had a choice of antiseptic solutions (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Naami-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Naami 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wheelock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wheelock 1997</LINK>), and details of the randomisation are poor in many of the trials.</P>

<P>Uncertainty remains about the optimal method of hand antisepsis for minimising SSI outcomes: only four studies reported this outcome, and they were heterogeneous, at high risk of bias and mainly greatly underpowered. For the secondary (and surrogate) outcome of the number of CFUs on the hands, there is some generally low or very low quality evidence that quality chlorhexidine aqueous scrubs may reduce CFUs compared with povidone iodine aqueous scrubs and that an alcohol rub with added ingredient reduced the number of CFUs on the hand compared with aqueous scrubs (different types) immediately after antisepsis and at the end of the surgical procedure. The evidence regarding the impact of using a nail pick or brush on CFUs is unclear. In terms of duration of antisepsis, scrubbing for 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes may lead to fewer CFUs on the hand (low or very low quality evidence). Other data are more difficult to interpret.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-06 14:19:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials should attempt to measure the impact of hand antisepsis on SSIs. Investigators should also adhere to a recognised definition of SSI, which includes a 30 day follow-up. Trials should use adequate sample sizes based on a priori sample size calculations and take account of any data cross-over and/or clustering. The following trials might address important clinical questions - these and related uncertainties should be prioritised in conjunction with health professionals and policy makers. Future studies should be adequately designed and powered.<BR/>

<P>Tanner conducted a randomised controlled trial in April to June 2008 comparing nail brushes and nail picks with 164 operating room staff. This study found no difference in the number of colony forming units on the hands of the scrub staff one hour after they had scrubbed with antiseptic solution and a nail pick, antiseptic solution and a nail brush or antiseptic solution alone. The authors of this review have not been informed of other studies in this field.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-24 12:59:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process, such as referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; tossing a coin; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example, sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process available to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or were not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or is not described in sufficient detail to allow a definitive judgement, for example, if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Blinding (participants, personnel and outcome assessors) - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others is unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
