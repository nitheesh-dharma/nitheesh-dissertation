<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-11 10:36:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In some cultures, food and drinks are consumed during labour for nourishment and comfort to help meet the demands of labour. However, in many birth settings, oral intake is restricted in response to work by Mendelson in the 1940s. Mendelson reported that during general anaesthesia, there was an increased risk of the stomach contents entering the lungs. The acid nature of the stomach liquid and the presence of food particles were particularly dangerous, and potentially could lead to severe lung disease or death. Since the 1940s, obstetrical anaesthesia has changed considerably, with better general anaesthetic techniques and a greater use of regional anaesthesia. These advances, and the reports by women that they found the restrictions unpleasant, have led to research looking at these restrictions. In addition, poor nutritional balance may be associated with longer and more painful labours, and fasting does not guarantee an empty stomach or less acidity. This review looked at any restriction of fluids and food in labour compared with women able to eat and drink. The review identified five studies involving 3130 women. Most studies had looked at specific foods being recommended, though one study let women choose what they wished to eat and drink. The review identified no benefits or harms of restricting foods and fluids during labour in women at low risk of needing anaesthesia. There were no studies identified on women at increased risk of needing anaesthesia. None of the studies looked at women's views of restricting fluids and foods during labour. Thus, given these findings, women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-12 12:38:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>We identified 19 studies of which we included five, involving 3130 women. We excluded eight studies, one awaits classification and five are ongoing studies. All the included studies looked at women in active labour and at low risk of potentially requiring a general anaesthetic. One study looked at complete restriction versus giving women the freedom to eat and drink at will; two studies looked at water only versus giving women specific fluids and foods and two studies looked at water only versus giving women carbohydrate drinks.</P>
<P>When comparing any restriction of fluids and food versus women given some nutrition in labour, the meta-analysis was dominated by one study undertaken in a highly medicalised environment. There were no statistically significant differences identified in: caesarean section (average risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.25, five studies, 3103 women), operative vaginal births (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10, five studies, 3103 women) and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (average RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.68, four studies, 2902 infants), nor in any of the other outcomes assessed. Women's views were not assessed. The pooled data were insufficient to assess the incidence of Mendelson's syndrome, an extremely rare outcome. Other comparisons showed similar findings, except one study did report a significant increase in caesarean sections for women taking carbohydrate drinks in labour compared with water only, but these results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was small.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-08 07:43:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the evidence shows no benefits or harms, there is no justification for the restriction of fluids and food in labour for women at low risk of complications. No studies looked specifically at women at increased risk of complications, hence there is no evidence to support restrictions in this group of women. Conflicting evidence on carbohydrate solutions means further studies are needed and it is critical in any future studies to assess women's views.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-30 09:21:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, in some societies, special food and drinks were offered during labour and specific foods were sometimes discouraged (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2002</LINK>). In the early 1900s, Dr DeLee, an American obstetrician, recommended that women take liquids to preserve their strength during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988a</LINK>). However, by the 1940s views had changed, and practitioners believed that eating and drinking in labour might be dangerous. Work by Mendelson in the 1940s showed high morbidity and mortality in women under general anaesthesia for caesarean section who inhaled liquids and particles of food from the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 1946</LINK>). This led to common policies of food and fluid restrictions during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Champion-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Champion 2002</LINK>). Although many women may not feel like eating in labour (<LINK REF="REF-McNabb-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNabb 2002</LINK>), some women find this restriction unpleasant and sometimes harrowing (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>). The importance of this aspect of a woman's autonomy, choice and control in labour should also be a consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A survey of labour ward policies in England in 1985 revealed that over a third of consultant maternity units allowed no fluids whatsoever during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1985</LINK>). In the United States, a survey in 1988 showed that almost half the hospitals and birth centres had a policy of 'nil by mouth' except ice chips (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1988</LINK>). A later survey of 351 units in England and Wales found that one-third allowed some form of food and drink and more than 90% allowed some form of oral intake, usually water (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 1991</LINK>). More recently, in 2003, a survey in the UK showed a liberalising trend, with 47% of women having 'access' to food and drink in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2006</LINK>).   </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-09 06:37:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluid and nutrient needs during labour are not well studied (<LINK REF="REF-Micklewright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micklewright 2002</LINK>). The need for energy is increased during pregnancy and labour, and metabolic processes generally adjust to address these needs (<LINK REF="REF-Pipkin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pipkin 2001</LINK>). Many believe that elevated levels of ketone bodies, which accumulate during exercise or starvation (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1971</LINK>), and at times during labour are a physiological response with little clinical significance. However, associations between ketone levels and longer labours and maternal psychological stress have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>). It is difficult to determine whether ketone production contributes to the longer labour or whether such production is a consequence of longer labour. The presence of ketonuria should be considered a signal for metabolic imbalance, though the effect of the imbalance is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-04 12:03:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People take for granted the ability to eat and drink in response to hunger and thirst. Hence, withholding all food and fluids, or withholding all food but allowing only sips of water, from women during labour is an 'intervention'. This intervention is generally used during active labour when women are in hospital, and many women in early labour will eat and drink at will at home. Some hospitals prescribe specific foods which are 'allowed' in labour, but this is also considered an intervention since it limits a women's autonomy and freedom of choice. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-04 12:03:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for withholding food and fluid during labour is to decrease the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality from Mendelson's syndrome if a general anaesthetic is required (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 1946</LINK>). It was thought that fasting would ensure small gastric volumes, but recent reviews suggest that there is no evidence to support this belief (<LINK REF="REF-Micklewright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micklewright 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Sullivan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Sullivan 1994</LINK>). Interventions to reduce stomach contents or the acidity of the content, both by pharmacological means and by restriction of oral intake, have not proved successful (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1975</LINK>). Also gastric emptying is delayed during labour, which may contribute to the problem (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 1975</LINK>). Irrespective of whether a woman has been starved or not during labour, anaesthetic precautions are necessary to reduce the risk of gastric content aspiration. These include using regional rather than general anaesthesia, and using rapid sequence induction with airway protection for general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Am-Soc-Anesth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Am Soc Anesth 1999</LINK>). With modern techniques, particularly the use of regional analgesia, the risk of gastric content aspiration has become extremely small (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravenous therapy instead of oral hydration is common practice during labour. Historically, practitioners administered high-dose glucose solutions to combat the development of ketones (<LINK REF="REF-Ketteringham-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ketteringham 1939</LINK>). More commonly now, intravenous fluids are isotonic or low-dose glucose, as high-dose glucose solutions are associated with increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) (<LINK REF="REF-Grylack-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grylack 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendiola-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendiola 1982</LINK>). Dextrose-only solutions cause a fall in serum osmolality and sodium concentration (hyponatraemia) (<LINK REF="REF-Begum-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begum 1999</LINK>). Regardless of solution type, intravenous therapy predisposes women to immobilisation, stress, increased risk of fluid overload, and does not ensure a nutrient and fluid balance for the demands of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Simkin-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simkin-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 1986b</LINK>). The value and safety of routine intravenous fluid therapy has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Begum-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begum 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-04 12:03:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Restricting oral food and fluid intake of women in active labour in hospitals is a strongly held obstetric and anaesthetic tradition. Restriction of oral intake is not a common practice in home births or birth centres (<LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1989</LINK>), nor is the practice consistent across hospital sites (<LINK REF="REF-Haire-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haire 1991</LINK>). Few, if any, centres have policies that are reflective of women's preferences (<LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998</LINK>). Most are based on historical, but important concerns, related to the risks of gastric content regurgitation and aspiration into the lungs during general anaesthesia, a risk first identified by Mendelson in the 1940s. The incidence is very rare with modern anaesthetic techniques and the use of regional anaesthesia rather then general anaesthesia. However, the syndrome is potentially fatal.</P>
<P>The risks of regurgitation and Mendelson's syndrome exist, although the incidence of each is very rare. The policy of routine restriction of foods and fluids in labour in many hospitals across the world generally does not reflect women's preferences or cultural expectations (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988b</LINK>). It is critical that any policy should be based on evidence of overall benefit to women and babies. This systematic review may assist in resolving the clinical uncertainty, which is currently apparent.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>Five studies assessed this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheepers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scheepers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scrutton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scrutton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2005</LINK>). The overall quality of the studies was reasonable with three studies having adequate randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment and no exclusions of loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheepers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scheepers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2005</LINK>). The large size of the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK> study in comparison with the size of the other studies means that for any outcome that included data from the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK> study will be dominated by these data. This study was undertaken in a highly medicalised environment where women entering the study were considered to have no known obstetric or medical complication that would increase the likelihood of an operative birth, yet 30% of women in the trial had a caesarean section. Other interventions, including oxytocin augmentation, IV fluids, epidurals, and instrumental births, also showed high rates in this study (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since in this comparison we were pooling a range of restrictive practices and a range on comparison forms of care, we considered we had clinical heterogeneity. We, therefore, used the random-effects model of meta-analyses as we did not expect a single common (or 'fixed') effect underlying every study in the meta-analysis. Rather, we assumed that the individual studies were estimating different treatment effects and that the different effects had a distribution with some central value and some degree of variability. For those analyses where there was moderate or high statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 30%), we have provided estimates of Tau<SUP>2</SUP> I<SUP>2</SUP> and the P value of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity.</P>

<P>This review includes five studies involving 3130 women. There are four comparisons with associated data and 41 meta-analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For women considered at low risk of potentially needing general anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>We identified no benefits or risks of restricting oral fluids and foods in labour, in women at low risk of potentially requiring general anaesthesia in this review. In particular, in none of the primary outcomes of caesarean section, operative vaginal birth and five-minute Apgar score less than seven did we see any statistically significant difference between the groups. Maternal satisfaction and hypoglycaemia, both also primary outcomes in this review, were not reported in any of the included studies. No women included in this review suffered from regurgitation during general anaesthesia or Mendelson's syndrome, a very rare complication in modern anaesthesia. We were not able to undertake a systematic review of such adverse outcomes, but plan to do so in a future update if data become available. There were no significant differences identified in any of the outcomes assessed in the review for women at low risk of potentially needing general anaesthesia in any of the comparisons made, though this may be related to the small numbers of women involved in the assessment of some individual outcomes. However, one large study dominated the findings in this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK>) and this hospital had high medical intervention rates. In particular, this study (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK>) included only women with no known obstetric or medical complication that would increase the likelihood of an operative birth, yet 30% of women in the study had a caesarean section. It may be that in less medicalised environments there might be differences in outcomes identified. Also, women were told that "...eating was not recommended in labour...but were actively encouraged to do so if randomised to the feeding arm". Since most women do not want conflict with their caregivers, this may have influenced their behaviour.</P>
<P>Only one study looked at restricting oral intake in labour with women who had freedom to eat and drink at will during labour. No benefits or risks of restricting women in this way were identified for women at low risk of needing a general anaesthetic.</P>
<P>Looking at restricting women to water only compared with giving them carbohydrate drinks during labour, identified different findings for the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheepers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scheepers 2002</LINK>). One study, involving 203 women, showed a reduction in caesarean section for women taking water only (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.77, 201 women) and the authors postulated that this may be due to a re-distribution of blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract from the myometrium (<LINK REF="STD-Scheepers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scheepers 2002</LINK>). However, the other study found no difference in the incidence of caesarean sections (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.38, 60 women). It is unclear where this difference arises from and could merely be a result of small numbers of women included in the studies. It would be important to investigate this further as some carbohydrate drinks may increase the risk of caesarean section. It would be worth comparing the use of carbohydrate drinks compared with freedom to eat and drink at will during labour to see if this really is a problem.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For women at increased risk of potentially needing general anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>There were no studies looking at this population of women. Again, the better general anaesthetic techniques and the increased use of regional anaesthesia mean that the incidence of Mendelson's syndrome and regurgitation during general anaesthesia are very rare in this population of women as well.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 09:29:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When considering any restriction of fluids and food during labour compared with some fluids and food available to women, the pooled data are dominated by one large study involving 2443 women at low risk of complications (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2009</LINK>). However, in this study there were very high intervention rates, particularly for women considered at low risk of complications (over 50% oxytocin augmentation, just under 70% getting intravenous fluids and epidurals in labour, 30% caesarean sections, 27% operative vaginal births). In addition, 20% of the women in the water-only arm ate during labour and 29% of the women in the food and fluids arm chose not to eat in labour (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This clearly reflects the wide variation in women's wishes for food and fluids during labour.</P>

<P>The possibility of introducing bias was present at every stage of reviewing process. We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways; two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Each worked independently.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-04 12:03:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although restricting fluids and foods during labour has been standard policy in many countries over many years (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998</LINK>), current policies are tending to be less restrictive (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). This possibly reflects an acknowledgement of the lack of evidence to restrict women's access to fluids and food during labour (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) and some women's unpleasant and harrowing experiences of such restrictions (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>). Although NICE suggested that women should be informed that isotonic drinks may be more beneficial than water, our evidence suggests otherwise (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). Where NICE looked at one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2002</LINK>) that assessed the impact of isotonic drinks on blood levels of biochemical substances, we assessed the impact on clinical outcomes and included all studies assessing carbohydrate solutions, with one study showing an increase in caesarean sections with carbohydrate solutions compared with water. There clearly needs to be more research on this aspect.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-12 14:06:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence identified no benefits or harms associated with restricting women's access to fluids and foods during labour for women at low risk of potentially requiring a general anaesthetic, although the studies did not assess women's views or feelings of control. Hence, women should have the autonomy and freedom to choose whether to eat or drink in labour, or not. Women should be able to consume what they desire and in doing so experience no adverse impact on labour, maternal or fetal outcomes. Most women seem to naturally reduce their intake as labour progresses and becomes more intense. We found no evidence from randomised trials on which to base practice regarding food or fluids in labour for women at increased risk of complications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>

<P>Further research would be helpful to determine the impact of differing fluids and foods taken during labour, such as carbohydrate solutions. While Mendelson's syndrome is an important adverse outcome, it is very rare and not the most appropriate outcome measure for studies exploring the effectiveness of food and fluid intake during labour. A better approach to the problem of this very rare but important complication of regurgitation during general anaesthesia and Mendelson's syndrome, would be to study interventions that have been shown to be effective at reducing the acidity and volume of stomach contents for elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2010</LINK>) to see if such interventions are effective if implemented during labour once it has been decided that a general anaesthetic is required. In addition, research is needed to determine the most effective nutrient and hydration strategies for women in labour within the context of common medical and obstetrical practices, such as epidurals and oxytocin stimulation.</P>

<P>All three review authors have contributed to the preparation of the protocol. All three authors undertook data extraction. G Gyte (GG) entered the data into RevMan and M Singata (MS) and J Tranmer (JT) checked this for accuracy. GG drafted the results section. All three authors discussed and agreed the interpretation. GG prepared the 2013 update, which was approved by MS and JT.</P>

<P>The protocol said an additional search would be undertaken of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using specific search terms.</P>
<P>#1 (ORAL near FEED*)<BR/>#2 (ORAL near FLUID*)<BR/>#3 (ORAL near HYDRAT*)<BR/>#4 (ORAL near INTAKE)<BR/>#5 EAT*<BR/>#6 DRINK*<BR/>#7 FOOD<BR/>#8 LABOR<BR/>#9 LABOUR<BR/>#10 LABOR*:ME<BR/>#11 ((((((#1 or #2) or #3) or #4) or #5) or #6) or #7)<BR/>#12 ((#8 or #9) or #10)<BR/>#13 (#11 and #12)</P>
<P>However, as this was already covered in the search undertaken by the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group office, we did not undertake the additional search and we have removed the reference to it.</P>
<P>We have modified the wording in the methods sections for &#8216;Assessment of heterogeneity&#8217;, &#8216;Assessment of reporting bias&#8217; and &#8216;Data synthesis&#8217; to update them with the new methods being used by the group, developed in conjunction with the group's statistician, Simon Gates, and Richard Riley. We have used these new methods in the review.</P>
<P>In contrast to the published protocol, we included 'allowing particular oral food and fluid regimens' in our types of interventions.</P>
<P>We have added 'maternal mortality' as a secondary outcome and changed 'Breastfeeding success' to 'Fully breastfeeding at discharge'.</P>

<U>There is a typing error in the published paper</U>. Where it reports (page 323) "Intravenous therapy was initiated in 85% (n = 278) of all labours, generally between 3 and 4 cm dilatation. Normal saline or Ringers lactate solutions were the most common solutions used in conjunction with epidural. When labours were augmented with oxytocin, the oxytocin was administered in a solution of 2/3 glucose and 1/3 saline". <U>This should have read</U> "Intravenous therapy, with isotonic solutions of either Ringer's lactate or normal saline, was used in 85% of labours (n = 278), most commonly for initiation of oxytocin therapy or fluid hydration for initiation of epidural analgesia. In 2 instances, one in the control and one in the intervention group, women received a solution of 2/3 glucose and 1/3 saline". (Tramner 2009, personal communication).</LI>
<LI>During early labour at home, most women in both groups tended to follow their normal dietary pattern with around 50% reporting carbohydrate intake. Oral intake was recorded both at home and in hospital.</LI>
<LI>Oral intake (but not inclusion in the study) was restricted when women developed intrapartum complications or had epidural analgesia.</LI>
<LI>Women rated their perceptions of thirst, hunger, nausea and fatigue on 7-point Linkert-type scales anchored at each end with descriptors, such as <I>worst nausea</I> to <I>no nausea</I>.</LI>
<LI>Intervention rates: IV oxytocin 41%; epidurals 77%; CS 22%; OVB 2%.</LI>
<LI>Of the 78% who returned the questionnaire, 56% (63/119) of women in the unrestricted access group reported they ate or drank some source of carbohydrates, in comparison to only 13% (15/120) in the ice-chips/sips of water-only group.</LI>

<P>20% of women in the water-only group ate in labour. This may have caused some bias in the outcome estimations, but shows in part women's views of restricting food and fluids during labour.</P>
<P>29% of women chose not to eat any food during labour. This would be considered part of women's freedom of choice whether to eat or not during labour.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Oral intake was restricted when women developed intrapartum complications or had epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia was used in 120/165 (73%) of women in the water-only group and 129/163 (79%) women in the freedom to eat group. It is unclear whether this impacted on outcomes.</P>
<P>Of the 78% who returned the questionnaire, 56% (63/119) of women in the unrestricted access group reported they ate or drank some source of carbohydrates, in comparison to only 13% (15/120) in the ice-chips/sips of water-only group</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of oral intake during labour on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. The authors' conclusions were that oral fluids and food during labour do not effect neonatal or obstetric outcomes. However, a fully dilated cervix is a major contributor to spontaneous delivery, and the quicker the cervix dilates the shorter the labour.  The kind of food laboring mothers need is food that contributes to the process of cervical dilation, thus shortening labour, that gives them energy, and that hydrates them and prepares them for the afterbirth period. The foods used in the studies in this review were those rich in carbohydrates, thus providing energy and hydration to the patients. They lacked nutritional benefits that might help with cervical dilation process. This may have caused the balance between the two groups, hence the observation of no difference between the groups.</P>
<P>The review needed to include foods rich in oxytocin for improvement in rate of dilation, carbohydrates for energy; potassium to reduce the incidence of vomiting, and foods that contribute to milk production. One food that is rich in these essential components is the date fruit<SUP>1</SUP>. The botanical name of the date palm is <I>Phoenix dactylifera</I>, a member of the family Palmae (Arecaceae). If such foods had been included in the review then there would have been an effect on some of the outcome variables, such as labour duration and cervical dilation rate.</P>

<P>Thank you for your feedback. You are proposing an interesting hypothesis. In fact, the objective of this review was not to evaluate the effects of oral intake in labour on obstetric and neonatal outcomes but <I>&#8220;To determine the benefits and harms of oral fluid and food <U>restriction</U> during labour...&#8221;</I>, so we considered the restriction of what women might normally consume during labour as the intervention. We concluded that &#8220;<I>The evidence identified no benefits or harms&#8230;&#8221; so we</I> were careful not to say that &#8216;oral foods and fluids do not affect neonatal and obstetric outcomes&#8217;, but that we found no evidence to this effect; that is, we found &#8216;no evidence of effect&#8217; and not &#8216;evidence of no effect&#8217;.  We can only include in the systematic review trials that have been undertaken, and we identified none which tested your hypothesis on the consumption of dates. If we were in the future to identify such a trial, we would include it, if appropriate; for example, in Comparison 6 &#8216;Complete restriction of oral fluid and food (other than ice chips) versus specific oral food and fluids&#8217;, In addition, for some women it is not the length of labour which is important but their ability to work with their body to give birth to their baby, and restricting food and fluids in labour may interfere with how women feel about the birth.</P>

<P>Aspiration in association with obstetric anaesthesia is a condition with significant maternal morbidity and risk of maternal mortality.  This review includes a relatively small number of cases of the rare but serious complications of aspiration. It is therefore possibly open to debate for the authors to state in the abstract conclusion: "there is no justification for the restriction of fluids and food in labour for women at low risk of complications".  </P>
<P>The next sentence states that as there are no studies looking specifically at women with increased risk of complications: "there is no evidence to support restrictions in this group of women".  This conclusion could potentially be misconstrued as supporting women in the high risk group eating in labour.  As there are no specific studies comparing diet in labour in high risk women, the conclusion for high risk women, could have been: "as there are no studies looking specifically at women with increased risk of complication, there is no evidence to support not restricting food in this group of women". <BR/>

<P>Thank you for your feedback. We agree that in the absence of evidence regarding the risk for women with high risk of complications, the conclusion of the review should be neutral, so we have modified our wording to make this clearer: &#8220;We found no evidence from randomised trials on which to base practice regarding food or fluids in labour for women at increased risk of complications&#8221;.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving the third author.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should have produced comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods used as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. random number table; computer random-number generator; tossing a coin, minimisation);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study all the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We also provided any information relating to whether the intended blinding was effective. Where blinding was not possible, we assessed whether the lack of blinding was likely to have introduced bias.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the completeness of outcome data for each main outcome, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition/exclusion where reported, and any re-inclusions in analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P> We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. where there were no missing data or where reasons for missing data are balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (e.g. where missing data are likely to be related to outcomes or are not balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>unclear (e.g. where there is insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit a judgement to me made).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was examined by us and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> 6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. For example, was there a potential source of bias related to the specific study design? Was the trial stopped early due to some data-dependent process? Was there extreme baseline imbalance? Has the study been claimed to be fraudulent?</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>

<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> 7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about risk of bias for important outcomes both within and across studies. With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses; see '<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>'.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but used different methods. <B> </B>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We found no cluster-randomised trials, but had we done so, we would have included them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Their sample sizes would have been adjusted using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we noted the levels of attrition. We would have explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis, had the issue arisen.</P>
<P>Where data have not been reported for some outcomes or groups, we attempted to contact the study authors for further information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T<SUP>2</SUP>, I<SUP>2</SUP> and Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistics.  We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if  T<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than zero and either I<SUP>2 </SUP>was greater than 30% or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>Where we might have suspected reporting bias (see 'Selective reporting bias' above), we would have attempted to contact study authors asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this was not possible, and we thought the missing data could introduce serious bias, we would have explored the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Had there been 10 or more studies in a meta-analysis, we would have investigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.  We would have assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually, and used formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes, we would have used the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we would have used the tests proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Peters-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry had been detected by any of these tests or had been suggested by a visual assessment, we would have performed exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intention-to-treat analysis</HEADING>
<P>We analysed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.  If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects analysis to produce an overall summary, if this was considered clinically meaningful. If an average treatment effect across trials had not been clinically meaningful, we would not have combined the heterogeneous trials. If we used random-effects analyses, we presented the results as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Had there been sufficient data, we would have conducted planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Women at low risk of potentially requiring general anaesthesia versus women at high risk of potentially requiring general anaesthesia. We looked at all outcomes for this subgroup analysis as we believed this to be such an important consideration.</LI>
<LI>Routine administration of intravenous (IV) fluids in the restricted group versus no routine administration of IV fluids in the restricted group. We restricted these analyses to primary outcomes only.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We were unable to undertake the subgroup analysis comparing the administration of IV fluids as the data did not exist. We will restrict any future subgroup analyses to primary outcomes only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality for primary outcomes in the review. Where there was risk of bias associated with a particular aspect of study quality (e.g. inadequate allocation concealment), we explored this by sensitivity analysis.</P>
