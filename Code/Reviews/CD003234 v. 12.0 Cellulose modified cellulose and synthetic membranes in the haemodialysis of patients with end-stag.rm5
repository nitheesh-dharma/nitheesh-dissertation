<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Not enough evidence to show the effect of synthetic membranes when compared with cellulose membranes for haemodialysis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>When the kidney fails the blood cannot be filtered properly. Protein breakdown and water need to be removed by haemodialysis, a mechanical process that passes blood over a special filtering membrane. Natural membranes such as cellulose are used. The more expensive synthetic types are considered more compatible as they cause less of an immune response but it is not clear how real clinical outcomes are affected. The review compared synthetic membranes with cellulose/modified cellulose membranes. Not enough evidence was found to show a beneficial effect for synthetic membranes although some improvements were noted. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Thirty two studies were identified.

When analysed for change in ß<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin, a fall was only noted with high-flux membranes. The incidence of amyloid was less in patients who were dialysed for six years with high-flux synthetic membranes (one study, RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.54). There was a significant difference in favour of the synthetic (high-flux) membrane in comparison to cellulose membranes for triglycerides (MD -0.66; 95% CI -1.18 to -0.14) but not for modified cellulose membranes. Dialysis adequacy measured by Kt/V was marginally higher when cellulose membranes were used (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.16 to 0.04), whereas synthetic membranes achieved significantly higher Kt/V values when compared with modified cellulose membranes (MD 0.20, 95% 0.11 to 0.29) .

<P>We found no evidence of benefit when synthetic membranes were compared with cellulose/modified cellulose membranes in terms of reduced mortality no reduction in dialysis-related adverse symptoms.

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 13:30:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>When the kidney fails the blood-borne metabolites of protein breakdown and water cannot be excreted. The principle of haemodialysis is that such substances can be removed when blood is passed over a semi-permeable membrane with dialysate flowing on the other side. Metabolites are removed mainly by diffusion, and water removed by applying a pressure gradient across the membrane.</P>
<P>Cellulose-based membranes are produced principally from cotton. They were the first membranes produced for dialysis and in their standard form have a low permeability to water molecules (&lt;10 mL/h/m<SUP>2</SUP>/mm Hg) and are commonly known as low-flux membranes. They characteristically also have poor clearance of molecules larger in size than urea and creatinine which may be responsible for some of the clinical features of uraemia. In recent years standard cellulose membranes have been modified to make both larger molecule and water removal more efficient; such membranes are called modified cellulose, substituted cellulose or semi synthetic membranes and can more readily be made with a higher flux than cellulose membranes. They are generally more expensive than standard membranes. <BR/> <BR/>In the early 1970s synthetic, polymer-based membranes became available which could be manufactured with either high- or low-flux characteristics. They remove ß<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin, (a middle molecule which may cause dialysis-related amyloid disease) more effectively particularly those which are high-flux. Such membranes have been used by those wishing to reduce the number of hours in a dialysis session as they can provide increased dialysis adequacy in a shorter period. Synthetic membranes are also regarded as more "biocompatible" in that they incite less of an immune response than cellulose-based membranes. In certain renal units dialysis membranes are cleaned or "reprocessed" after use and reused for the same patient. This is more commonly done for the more expensive synthetic membranes.</P>
<P>The greater stimulation of the immune system by the cellulose membranes may increase patients susceptibility to infection and malnutrition and may also, through production of cytokines and stimulation of the complement system, be partially responsible for the adverse symptoms experienced during haemodialysis treatment. It is of particular importance to evaluate the benefits of the synthetic membranes particularly those of high-flux since they are generally around three to four times more expensive than cellulose or modified cellulose membranes. Despite the economic and practical importance of the choice of dialysis membrane it is not clear to nephrologists or health care purchasers what the benefits of synthetic membranes are and, if benefits exist, whether they justify their extra cost.</P>
<P>Comparison of membranes according to material and flux requires two systematic reviews. We selected membrane material as the main comparator for this review because it is generally accepted that biocompatible membranes exert less of an inflammatory response and hence may cause less morbidity and possibly mortality than cellulose-based membranes. In all cases, however, we noted the flux of the membranes used. A second review comparing low- and high-flux has been undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Rabindranath-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabindranath 2004</LINK>)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Initial search</HEADING>
<P>Because this was one of a number of reviews we undertook relevant to the management of ESRD, a broad search strategy was employed which attempted to identify all RCTs or quasi-RCTs relevant to the management of ESRD. Eight electronic databases were initially searched: MEDLINE 1966-1996, EMBASE 1980-1996, CINAHL 1982-1996, BIOSIS 1985-June 1995, <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 1996), SIGLE (1980-June 1996) and NRR (14th consolidation Sept 1996) (all searches were performed during 1995 and 1996). This search strategy was created independently by our reviewers in the absence of any Cochrane Renal Collaborative Review Group at the inception of this study. Authors of included studies were contacted, reference lists of identified RCTs and relevant narrative reviews were screened, relevant biomedical companies were contacted and one nephrology journal (Kidney International 1980-1997, inclusive) was handsearched (full-text searching).</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<I>Handsearching: </I>Kidney International (including supplements) 1980 to 1997 was handsearched. However, conference proceedings, published in abstract form only, were only searched for one year, 1994. Hand-searching was performed by two members of the team, one of whom was a nephrologist. Two quality assurance controls were implemented. A 'Gold Standard' was devised. This consisted of the 1990 and 1995 volumes of Kidney International which were searched by both hand-searchers independently. After discussion an agreed assessment of all studies in these issues was made; this became the 'Gold Standard'. A sensitivity and precision (specificity) of greater than 90% was required of each searcher. Quality of hand-searching throughout the period of the review was maintained by each reviewer checking 5% of the other reviewer's studies. This 5% was chosen at random. We attempted to identify all possible RCTs and controlled clinical trials regardless of subject matter. All identified trials were notified to the Renal Cochrane Collaborative Group and to the Baltimore Cochrane Centre. Hard copies were made of the complete identified trials relevant to any of the systematic reviews in the management of ESRD which we are undertaking.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Bibliographies: </I>Bibliographies of all studies included in this review, of all other identified relevant studies and of relevant book chapters were examined by subject-experts (nephrologists). We limited this bibliography searching to the 'first generation' studies only. We therefore did not search the bibliographies of studies originally identified from a previous bibliographic search.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Contacting authors: </I>Authors of included studies and of studies whose methodology we were seeking clarification were contacted to ascertain if they knew of any further published, unpublished or still-to-be completed RCTs on this particular subject.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Contacting biomedical companies: </I>Relevant biomedical companies were contacted to identify further published, unpublished or incomplete studies.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Translation: </I>Foreign language studies were assessed and translated if required.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Advertisement of interest: </I>We advertised our interest in finding published and unpublished RCTs and quasi-RCTs in any language relevant to this topic at the Exploratory meeting for the Renal Cochrane Collaborative Review Group, in Lyon, in March 1996 and at the Renal Association, UK, April 1996.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Review update</HEADING>
<P>Updated electronic searches specific to this review, using a more topic-focused search strategy, were undertaken in June 2004. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (June 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (May 1996 to June 2004), EMBASE (May 1996 to June 2004), CINAHL (April 1996 to June 2004), HealthSTAR (1975 to December 2000), and PreMEDLINE (29 November 2000) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>- <I>Electronic search strategies</I>).</P>

<P>During an initial pilot project all abstracts were read by both a subject expert and a methodology expert. There was a high degree of concurrence between them but they were assessed markedly more quickly by the subject experts and we decided that they alone should assess the abstracts.</P>
<P>The sensitive search strategy resulted in a large number of abstracts (11,800). All potentially eligible trials relevant to the management of ESRD were identified. These were assigned where appropriate to our specific topic files and the complete published paper retrieved. Hard copies of studies were assessed for subject relevance and methodological quality by a subject expert (nephrologist) and methodology expert. Quality and details of random allocation, blinding, withdrawals, dropouts, numbers lost to follow-up and whether it was possible to analyse the data on an intention-to-treat basis were recorded. The assessors were not blinded to author, institution nor journal of the assessed studies. Any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion. If agreement could not be reached, a third assessor evaluated the study, and, ware of the previous team's deliberations reached a final decision.</P>
<P>A single investigator abstracted data from each study describing the characteristics of participants, interventions and outcome measures using a standard form. Only published data in the identified trials were used; no raw data were sought although authors were contacted to clarify points in the Methods or Results sections of their papers.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis was performed where possible on quantitative data using RevMan 4.2. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data and a mean difference (MD) for continuous data using a random-effect model but the fixed effects model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers. Unfortunately because different studies used different methods of recording data for similar outcomes these data could not always be combined. Qualitative synthesis was then performed where appropriate.</P>
<P>Crossover studies were summarised separately from parallel group trials (in other data tables), where results from paired statistical tests are quoted.</P>
<P>Results from trials which randomised by patient yet analysed by dialysis session (without adjustment for clustering) were post-adjusted for the clustering effect using the method of (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1992</LINK>). Using estimates calculated from previous published data, an intra cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 was assumed for symptomatic hypotension and an ICC of 0.3 was assumed for patient symptoms such as headache, and nausea and vomiting.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Thirty two studies were identified that met our eligibility criteria of being randomised, quasi randomised or crossover controlled trials. The descriptions of method of allocation published were accepted and authors' confirmation was not sought. All included studies had been published in complete form. Clarification from the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 1993</LINK>) of the number of dialysis treatments with each type of membrane was sought and obtained such that the number of episodes of anaphylaxis per dialysis session could be calculated. A further 32 trials were excluded because no outcomes relevant to the review were reported, and 12 because the comparison was not between cellulose and synthetic membranes (see table of excluded studies). Eight studies were excluded because they were not RCTs.</P>

The majority of trials were thus relatively recent and for the most part describe membranes in current use. Twelve studies commented on the comorbid illnesses present in the dialysis patients and 13 excluded patients on the basis of comorbidity, although the nature of the excluding conditions varied from study to study. In some of the studies it was not possible to derive data for the outcome measure in question either because outcomes were not given in numerical form at all or because they were not given in sufficient detail (e.g. means given without SD or SE).

The ß<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin value before the last dialysis session of each study was entered into meta-analysis. Based on the data that was meta-analysable, the use of synthetic membranes was not associated with a significantly lower pre-dialysis &#946;<SUB>2 </SUB>levels in comparison with cellulose membranes (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>
<U>.1</U> (four trials, 407 patients): MD -14.67, 95% -33.10 to 4.05). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity between these four studies (I² = 97.1%) probably due to differences in membrane flux. <LINK REF="STD-Hakim-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hakim 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1996</LINK> showed no significantly lower value with synthetic membranes and they were characterised by the use of cellulose and synthetic membranes with a similar low-flux.

<P>The change (rise or fall) in &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin values across the trials was also noted.

In <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1996</LINK> the values fell but not significantly (from 40.4 to 37.5 mg/L).

Overall &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin values fell or rose less when biocompatible membranes were used. A fall in values was seen only with high-flux membranes. In a linked trial described in <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1996</LINK>, &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin fell significantly with high-flux synthetic membranes. <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 2000</LINK> quoted the median and interquartile range (IQR) and hence could not be entered into the meta-analysis. It showed a significant beneficial treatment effect (P &lt; 0.004) for a high-flux synthetic membrane (median 32.6, IQR 28.7 to 45.4) compared with a cellulose membrane (median 24.7, IQR 20.2 to 30.5). <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1997</LINK> studied &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin after five dialyses with cellulose and low-flux synthetic membranes in 35 patients who had six treatments on each of four dialysers (one cellulose, one cellulose acetate and two synthetic).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 13:29:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review has generated no evidence of benefit when synthetic membranes were used compared with cellulose/modified cellulose membranes in terms of reduced mortality nor reduction in dialysis-related adverse symptoms. Despite the relatively large number of RCTs undertaken in this area none of the included studies reported any measures of quality of life.</P>
<P>In two studies which measured triglyceride values there was a significant effect in favour of the synthetic (high-flux) membrane. In a further study by <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1996</LINK> there was also a reduction in cholesterol but it was not clear how the controls were selected. Serum albumin was higher in patients treated with synthetic membranes (both low and high-flux). <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1997</LINK> showed that URR was significantly greater when cellulose membranes were used. There was no significant difference between these membranes for any of the other outcome measures however there were only a few studies for each outcome, participant numbers were in general small and confidence intervals around these estimates were in most cases wide.</P>
<P>Many types of membranes are now manufactured; 111 "commonly used dialysers" are listed in the "<I>Handbook of Dialysis</I>"<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Daugirdas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daugirdas 2001</LINK>). They vary in surface area, clearance of various molecules, UFc, geometry (hollow fibre or parallel plate) as well as in the material from which they are made. Biocompatibility is generally believed to be a property of the material of the membrane, the more biocompatible the membrane, the fewer the blood-membrane interactions releasing complement and activating leucocytes. Whether such reactions lead to clinical sequelae such as malnutrition and infection is not totally clear as others have discussed (<LINK REF="REF-Baurmeister-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baurmeister 1989</LINK>). Synthetic membranes are more biocompatible and therefore have been made with a larger surface area. They can more easily be made porous and hence are suitable for more rapid removal of water and molecules larger than urea and creatinine, particularly &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin, (persistently high concentrations of which are generally believed to result in the development of amyloid over a period of several years in dialysis patients). This correlation, however, is still in some doubt (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1990</LINK>). Some synthetic membranes with high-flux characteristics and possibly also an ability to absorb substances such as &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin on to their surfaces are used to shorten dialysis time. This is popular both with patients and busy dialysis units, although rapid fluid removal may result in hypotension, which was not shown in this review. The beneficial effect of synthetic membranes on serum albumin levels, however, occurred in trials using both low and high-flux membranes. Although two studies showed lower pre-dialysis &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin values following the use of low-flux synthetic membranes although any drop in values across the studies could not be demonstrated as the values at the first dialysis were not given.<BR/>
<BR/>It is therefore somewhat disappointing, given the plethora of membranes and the claims made for them that more large well planned RCTs taking into account the material of the membrane and its flux have not been carried out. In particular, relatively small number of trials have been done which used outcome measures of symptoms felt by patients.</P>
<P>We identified 32 RCTs which had clinical outcome measures as their end points and some data from most of them have contributed to this review. <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1993</LINK> showed that a given symptom is recorded more frequently when patients rather than staff are asked to undertake recording. We had to choose which results to display although both were calculated for the four outcome measures. For hypotension, data from staff were shown. For the other outcomes (headache, nausea and vomiting and pruritus) patient-recorded data were displayed, although the risk ratios were generally similar whichever type of data were used. Most trials did not mention the method of symptom recording. Recording of symptoms is subjective and future trials should be explicit and record predominantly patient-reported data with blinding of the patients and the staff to the treatment where possible.</P>
<P>Significant heterogeneity between trials was noted when &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin values were assessed in parallel studies. This may have been because the trials varied in size and both low and high-flux membranes were used. There was some indication that values rose less across a trial with low-flux synthetic membranes than with cellulose membranes. Two small crossover studies suggested that the use of one low-flux synthetic membrane resulted in lower &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin values. These studies were relatively short, and compared pre-dialysis values at the end of the study between the membranes but did not indicate whether there was a reduction across the studies. &#946;<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin was used as a surrogate for amyloid as this disease takes many years to develop and in the one very small, unblinded six-year study, found the incidence of clinical amyloid, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthropathy or bone cysts was less with a high-flux synthetic membrane.</P>
<P>The comorbid illnesses of patients taking part in the trials were mentioned in some but not all of the studies. It is possible to argue that biocompatible membranes may be more suitable for patients with complex illnesses, but also that long dialysis commonly done with low-flux cellulose membranes may also be beneficial for some patients particularly those with cardiovascular instability. It would be useful, given the increasing comorbidity of dialysis patients, to be able to address these issues in a secondary stratified analysis but data to allow this is not currently available. Furthermore, it would be particularly useful to compare substituted cellulose membranes (which can be made with a higher flux than standard cellulose membranes (UFc around 15), and synthetic membranes with a similar flux.</P>
<P>Trials comparing cellulose with synthetic membranes which reported Kt/V as an outcome measure were varied greatly. Duration of dialysis session, blood flow and dialysate flow however, were not stated in all studies and this, along with the different population characteristics and study designs, makes it difficult to draw conclusions. <LINK REF="STD-Hakim-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hakim 1996</LINK> used inadequate Kt/V in the first two weeks of the trial as an exclusion criteria although not as an outcome measure. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1996</LINK> were not used, as achieving a given target Kt/V was an aim of the study management. Furthermore, in studies which described the methodology in some detail (<LINK REF="STD-Hakim-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hakim 1996</LINK>) there was a large dropout rate because of transfer of patients to another modality of dialysis, transplantation, transfer to another centre and non-compliance. Variation within the studies is therefore a major limitation of this review. <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1993</LINK> found that URR was significantly better when cellulose membranes were used, but <LINK REF="STD-Bonomini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bonomini 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1993</LINK> showed no difference when synthetic membranes were compared with cellulose and modified cellulose membrane in crossover studies. The effect of membrane material on dialysis adequacy is therefore not clear from the current data.</P>
<P>The management of ESRD is a high technology specialty for a relatively low volume of patients at great cost. Trials, therefore, tend to be on small groups of patients which are further reduced by the dropout rates mentioned above. Decision-making in this area is important because of the high cost of dialysis. RCTs can potentially make a valuable contribution, but to be really useful they require large numbers of patients with prolonged follow-up so that longer term implications which are important to patients can be adequately measured.</P>
<P>Surrogate outcome measures such as complement levels are more likely than primary outcome measures to change significantly over the course of a short study. They are easier to measure and hence are more frequently carried out. There is a real need, as others in the field have already suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Baurmeister-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baurmeister 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daugirdas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daugirdas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1996</LINK>) for further large multi-centre studies which assess hard clinical end-points such as mortality and hospitalisation. Such trials should state the patients' comorbid illnesses and perhaps stratify by co-morbidity before trial entry. The trials should be designed to evaluate the role of flux as well as the material from which the membrane is made and should have sufficient follow up so that clinical outcomes can be measured. In this way we could determine whether the new membranes which are being rapidly developed have improved the effectiveness over previously available membranes for patients or sub-groups of patients on haemodialysis. The recently published HEMO study (<LINK REF="REF-HEMO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">HEMO 1999</LINK>) has evaluated the role of flux and dialysis dose in chronic dialysis patients and have found that neither high-dialysis dose nor high-flux membranes confer any significant advantage over standard dialysis dose or low-flux membranes.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We are hesitant to recommend the universal use of synthetic membranes for haemodialysis in patients with ESRD because of the small numbers of trials particularly for modified cellulose membranes (many with low patient numbers), the heterogeneity of many of the trials considered, the variations in membrane flux and the differences in exclusion criteria particularly relating to comorbidity and the absence for benefit found for any patient-centred outcomes. Furthermore, this review has generated no evidence of benefit in terms of reduced mortality or reduction in dialysis related adverse symptoms; no study reported any measures of quality of life. In this review we have insufficient information to carry out a satisfactory economic evaluation. Such evidence as we have favours synthetic membranes but the extra benefit is likely to be at considerable cost, particularly if high-flux membranes were to be used.</P>

<BR/>The search strategy 018 to 037 is our translation from Silver Platter syntax of the first two of three stages of a strategy recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for the identification of the highest possible proportion of published randomised clinical trials (Dickersin 1994). By using only the first two of the three stages we increased the precision (specificity) but decreased the sensitivity of the search.<BR/>
