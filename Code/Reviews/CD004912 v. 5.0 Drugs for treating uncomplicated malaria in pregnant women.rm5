<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Susceptibility of pregnant women to malaria</HEADING>
<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes and endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. Pregnant women attract twice the number of mosquitoes as their non-pregnant counterparts, which probably increases their exposure to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2000</LINK>). Malaria contributes to illness and premature death in endemic areas, and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to the disease. It can cause severe maternal anaemia and malaria infection of the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menendez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menendez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 2001</LINK>), and can contribute to an increased risk of maternal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brabin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>) and low infant birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). As with any febrile illness, clinical disease also increases the risk of preterm birth, and preventing malaria infection in pregnant women with drugs appears to reduce perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2006</LINK>). The burden of malaria infection during pregnancy is caused mainly by the <I>Plasmodium falciparum </I>parasite.</P>
<P>The specific manifestation of malaria during pregnancy depends, in part, on the mother's level of acquired clinical immunity. Women living in areas where malaria transmission is low and unstable, such as Asia, have little or no immunity. These women are at risk of developing severe clinical disease as well as severe anaemia, which can result in maternal and fetal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). In areas of low or unstable malaria transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the risk of severe malaria illness is at least doubled in pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). Where there is a low incidence with less than one malaria infection per pregnancy some primigravidae will not become infected. This means that the higher risk of severe illness is likely to remain in subsequent pregnancies.</P>
<P>In areas where malaria transmission is high, such as parts of Africa, by the time women reach reproductive age they will normally have acquired partial immunity. This reduces the risk of illness and attenuates the clinical illness. The immunosuppression with pregnancy does, however, make women more susceptible and increase the risk of anaemia. Why this happens is debated: some suggest that the immune system may be down regulated in an attempt to protect the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2001</LINK>). In these areas, pregnant women are most at risk during their first and second pregnancies, with less suppression in later pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). Most women will not be aware that they are infected as they will experience no obvious clinical symptoms, but there is an increased risk of maternal anaemia and low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Brabin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabin 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Control of malaria in pregnant women</HEADING>
<P>Regional leaders at the African Summit on Roll Back Malaria (April 2000) committed themselves to an intensive effort to halve the malaria mortality in Africa by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003a</LINK>). Progress towards this target has so far been limited by resource shortages in the most affected countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RBM-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2005a</LINK>). In 2005, the WHO consolidated the strategy with the aim of covering 80% of pregnant women at risk of malaria with available control tools by 2010, and looking for equity and sustainability in the long-term progress being made towards 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2005b</LINK>). To achieve this target the WHO promotes a strategic framework for malaria control during pregnancy. In Africa, where malaria transmission is high, the framework recommends a three-pronged approach &#8211; intermittent preventive treatment, insecticide-treated nets, and case management of malaria illness &#8211; to reduce the burden of malaria infection among pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cochrane Reviews have demonstrated the effects and safety of malaria prevention strategies for pregnant women, including intermittent preventive treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2006</LINK>) and insecticide-treated nets (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2006</LINK>). In areas of low or unstable transmission (such as Asia), the focus is on the use of insecticide-treated nets and prompt case management when women become ill. Preventive interventions are for all pregnant women, but there is little attention in policy documents to the treatment of women with moderate to severe anaemia or who have symptoms of malaria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment of malaria in pregnant women</HEADING>
<P>Pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria infection should receive prompt treatment with effective antimalarial drugs to clear infection fast (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2001</LINK>). Unlike severe malaria, where the aim is to save the pregnant woman's life, in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria a judgement must be made between the risks and benefits of a potentially toxic treatment and the consequences of infection. The options for treatment of pregnant women with malaria are few, and many endemic countries still lack an official policy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>). Some data are available on the safety of drugs when used in prevention regimens, but pregnant women have been systematically excluded from most malaria treatment trials for fear of toxicity to the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Guerin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerin 2002</LINK>). Thus the options for treatment are limited by potential teratogenicity (the ability to cause defects in the developing fetus) coupled with a paucity of safety data for the mother and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some antimalarial drugs are not recommended in pregnancy because of recognized adverse effects. The tetracyclines and doxycycline are excluded because of adverse effects on bone growth (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). No data exist on the use of halofantrine in pregnant women, but the cardiotoxicity of the drug has compromised its role in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). Primaquine is not prescribed in pregnancy due to the risk of intravascular haemolysis in the mother and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Clyde-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyde 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). A study from Thailand examined stillbirth and exposure to mefloquine suggested that mefloquine use in pregnancy was associated with a small increased risk of stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 1999</LINK>); conversely, a large randomized controlled trial showed no difference in the stillbirth rate between women who were treated with mefloquine or chloroquine before starting prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Steketee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steketee 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment options are further reduced by the spread of drug-resistant <I>P. falciparum</I>. In recognition of the widespread resistance and decreased efficacy of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (particularly in Asia) (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>), the WHO now recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin in all trimesters of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). However, quinine sometimes causes hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), even in uncomplicated infections (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been shown to be safe and effective, and increasing experience with the use of these treatments in over 1000 pregnancies has not reported any serious adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Adjuik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adjuik 2004</LINK>). The WHO now suggests that the ACTs being used in the region (or artesunate plus clindamycin) should be deployed, as an alternative to quinine plus clindamycin in the second and third trimester (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Current guidelines do not recommend artemisinin compounds for malaria in women in the first trimester of pregnancy unless treatment is believed to be life saving for the mother and other antimalarial drugs are considered unsuitable (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, to slow the development of resistance, these drugs should only be used in combination. The selection of combination partner can be difficult, and the WHO gives no guidance on this. Further evidence of the safety of artemisinin compounds, and their partner treatments, in pregnancy will help inform decisions about their use as conventional therapies fail.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial design and location</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials were randomized, and two were quasi-randomized. Five were conducted in South-East Asia: one in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Bounyasong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bounyasong 2001</LINK>), and four in camps for displaced Karen people on the Thai-Burma border (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGready-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGready-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGready-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2005</LINK>). Five trials were conducted in Africa &#8211; each in a different country: Burkina Faso (<LINK REF="STD-Coulibaly-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Coulibaly 2006</LINK>); Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (<LINK REF="STD-Mbanzulu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mbanzulu 1993</LINK>); Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Sowunmi-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Sowunmi 1998a</LINK>); Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>); and Malawi (<LINK REF="STD-Kalilani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalilani 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Local antimalarial resistance was not stated in the Malawi trial. The Ghana trial was conducted in an area with chloroquine resistance. The Burkina Faso trial in an area of increasing chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. The DRC trial was conducted in an area with known resistance to a number of conventional treatments (including chloroquine, amodiaquine, and quinine). The other trials were conducted in areas with multiple-drug-resistant malaria.</P>
<P>Malaria transmission was stated for those trials carried out in the camps (low and seasonal), for the Burkina Faso trial (endemic and seasonal), and for the Malawi trial (perennial and seasonal).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>This review includes 1805 women, 900 of these from the Ghana trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>). All women were recruited in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. Although some trials included a high proportion of primigravidae, all trials included women of a range of parities.</P>
<P>The Nigerian trial evaluated women with acute symptomatic malaria who had all previously failed treatment with chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, or chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The five trials from Thailand evaluated treatments in women who were usually asymptomatic with parasitaemia detected at regular screening. The Burkina Faso trial recruited symptomatic women only. It is unclear whether malaria was symptomatic in the other trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared artesunate plus mefloquine with quinine (<LINK REF="STD-McGready-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bounyasong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bounyasong 2001</LINK>); and two trials compared sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine with chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-Coulibaly-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Coulibaly 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>). The remaining trials evaluated a wide variety of treatments, often in combination. All treatments were given at antenatal clinics. Women in the camps and in the Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Malawi trials were supervised when taking the drugs. In the Ghana trial the first dose was supervised. It is not clear if treatment was supervised in the other trials. <LINK REF="STD-Kalilani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalilani 2007</LINK> gave two courses of treatment at least four weeks apart.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>In most trials treatment failure was defined by parasite status only or the need for treatment. Clinical information was only reported in the Burkina Faso trial. Five trials excluded participants with new infections from the results. Seven of the 10 trials assessed a variety of pregnancy outcomes. Labour was monitored and newborns were generally followed up for up to 12 or 24 months. Five trials reported on low birthweight, and another two reported the mean birthweight only.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-11 10:52:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials assessing the safety and efficacy of treatments for uncomplicated malaria have involved 1805 pregnant women, 900 of which were involved in just one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>). These 10 trials examined 12 different regimen comparisons, so statistical power to detect differences was generally low. As most trials were rather small and varied in the treatments evaluated, it is not surprising that this review was unable to demonstrate any clear direction for policy.</P>
<P>Data from two trials in Thailand have shown that artesunate plus mefloquine (given in two different regimens) appears to be better than quinine in terms of clearing parasites and fever (<LINK REF="STD-McGready-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bounyasong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bounyasong 2001</LINK>). Although one trial reported that hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in the quinine group (<LINK REF="STD-Bounyasong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bounyasong 2001</LINK>), no details of how hypoglycaemia was defined, how it was measured, and how frequently it was tested were given, so the clinical significance is difficult to determine. Furthermore, artesunate plus atovaquone-proguanil appears to be more effective at clearing parasites than quinine (in Thailand); but these data are from one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-McGready-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2005</LINK>). Artesunate may be quicker at clearing parasites than quinine plus clindamycin (in Thailand; <LINK REF="STD-McGready-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">McGready 2001a</LINK>), which is consistent with the known pharmacokinetic properties of artemisinin derivatives. When chloroquine was compared with amodiaquine and amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in one trial in Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>), the two newer regimens were found to be more effective at clearing parasites. There are early indications that adding artesunate or azithromycin to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may improve parasite clearance (in Malawi; <LINK REF="STD-Kalilani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalilani 2007</LINK>); however, there are no reliable data on adverse events with this regimen.</P>
<P>Apart from the one large trial that was well-conducted and reported (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2006</LINK>), the methods used in the other trials were generally not clearly reported. Although it is not always easy to blind such trials, most trials were either quasi-randomized or did not report the method of generation of the allocation sequence, and only three reported any method of concealing treatment allocation.</P>
<P>There remains a concern over a possible association between stillbirth and mefloquine. There were not enough data from trials to allow this review to evaluate this. However, one large trial of prevention in Malawi (which was not included in this review) evaluated mefloquine prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Steketee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steketee 1996</LINK>). Women received a treatment course of mefloquine on entry to the trial. The trial recruited over 4187 women and showed that those allocated to the mefloquine group had similar numbers of stillbirths to the control group taking chloroquine. This contrasts with a retrospective analysis of observational data from Thailand that suggested an association between mefloquine use and stillbirth, after making an adjustment for confounding (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 1999</LINK>). However, the possibility of residual confounding remains.</P>
<P>None of the trials included women in their first trimester. As many trials did not state if the women were symptomatic or how many previous pregnancies they had experienced, it is not possible to assess the impact of these factors on treatment outcomes. Most trials supervised treatment or followed up the participants intensively. Hence, trials may not reflect what effects the treatments would have had when used in standard conditions.</P>
<P>Generally, trials in non-pregnant women are likely to inform treatment in pregnant women, and current treatments in Africa are moving towards artemisinin-based combination treatments. Fetal safety is clearly important. In 2003, an expert panel reviewed evidence from a variety of sources and considered that the risks of not using artemisinin derivatives in pregnancy outweighed any putative adverse effects in relation to embryo-lethality (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>). The WHO's new treatment guidelines for malaria reflect this opinion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). However, there are still not enough safety data to recommend their use in the first trimester of pregnancy.</P>
<P>Clearly, more trials are needed evaluating the current best regimens for malaria. The trials must be well-designed to reduce bias and methods must be clearly reported. Trialists should ensure that they investigate all relevant outcomes in the mother and fetus, including a systematic collection of data on adverse events and pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<P>When we prepared the first version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Orton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orton 2005</LINK>), we made some changes to the protocol. We specified the inclusion of quasi-randomized controlled trials, split the outcome measures into "maternal treatment response", "maternal adverse events", and "fetal outcomes" for added clarity, and excluded placental infection as an outcome measure because it is not a measure of treatment response. We also updated the methods for assessing blinding, changed the phrase "loss to follow up" to "inclusion of all randomized participants in the analysis" to reflect changes within the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and decided to use only the chi-squared test for heterogeneity (and not the I<SUP>2</SUP>).</P>
