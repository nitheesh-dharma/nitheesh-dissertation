<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Breastfeeding (BF) can improve the child's health, the mother's health and mother-infant bonding. BF infants have lower rates of stomach and breathing problems, fewer ear infections and better speech, vision and overall development of physical and mental skills. The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed from birth to six months and then breastfed alongside age-appropriate, complementary feeding for two years and beyond. Many women are unable to follow these recommendations, and we want to know how to help women to breastfeed.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Antenatal BF education is teaching women about BF during pregnancy, before the baby arrives. One reason women are unable to breastfeed has to do with lack of education and knowledge about how to breastfeed. We believe that improving pregnant women's knowledge of BF may help them to breastfeed longer, but we are unsure what types of education are most helpful to women.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We included 24 studies with 10,056 women in the review, and 20 studies involving 9789 women contributed data to the analyses. Most studies took place in high-income countries including the USA, Canada, UK and Australia. Peer counselling, lactation consultation and formal BF education during pregnancy do not appear to improve uptake of BF or duration. However, some larger trials in different settings (one in Nigeria and one in Singapore) had some evidence that education may help.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>We are still unsure if antenatal BF education is able to help women; at present, there is no good evidence from randomised controlled trials to suggest these efforts to educate pregnant women translate into more and longer BF. Women who receive standard care before birth tend to choose BF at about the same rate as women who have extra BF education. We are confident in the results of studies measuring women's uptake of BF at birth and BF at six months; education does not appear to impact these decisions. We have some doubts about the impact of education on exclusive BF at three and six months; education does not seem to help women, but future studies may change our understanding. Future studies are likely to change our understanding of the impact of BF education during pregnancy on BF at three months. Most of the studies in this review took place in higher income countries, so we are not confident that our conclusions are relevant in other settings.<BR/>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-27 15:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register on 1 March 2016, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 1 March 2016) and Scopus (January 1985 to 1 March 2016). We contacted experts and searched reference lists of retrieved articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-28 10:59:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All identified published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of formal antenatal BF education or comparing two different methods of formal antenatal BF education, on the duration of BF. We included RCTs that only included antenatal interventions and excluded those that combined antenatal and intrapartum or postpartum BF education components. Cluster-randomised trials were included in this review. Quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-08 14:22:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. Two review authors extracted data from each included study using the agreed form and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-01 15:26:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review update includes 24 studies (10,056 women). Twenty studies (9789 women) contribute data to analyses. Most studies took place in high-income countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Australia. In the first five comparisons, we display the included trials according to type of intervention without pooling data. For the 'Summary of findings' we pooled data for a summary effect.</P>
<P>Five included studies were cluster-randomised trials: all of these adjusted data and reported adjustments as odds ratios (OR). We have analysed the data using the generic inverse variance method and presented results as odds ratios, because we were unable to derive a cluster-adjusted risk ratio from the published cluster-trial. We acknowledge that the use of odds ratio prevents the pooling of these cluster trials in our main analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>One method of BF education with standard (routine) care</B>
</P>
<P>There were no group differences for duration of any BF in days or weeks. There was no evidence that interventions improved the proportion of women with any BF or exclusive BF at three or six months. Single trials of different interventions were unable to show that education improved initiation of BF, apart from one small trial at high risk of attrition bias. Many trial results marginally favoured the intervention but had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. BF complications such as mastitis and other BF problems were similar in treatment arms in single trials reporting these outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Multiple methods of BF education versus standard care</B>
</P>
<P>For all trials included in this comparison we have presented the cluster-adjusted odds ratios as reported in trial publications. One three-arm study found the intervention of BF booklet plus video plus Lactation Consultant versus standard care improved the proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.40; women = 159) and marginally at six months (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.76; women = 175). For the same trial, an intervention arm without a lactation consultant but with the BF booklet and video did not have the same effect on proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.05; women = 159) or six months (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.70; women = 184). One study compared monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone message versus standard care and reported improvements in the proportion of women exclusively BF at both three and six months (three months OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.95; women = 390; six months OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.11; women = 390). One study found monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone messages improved initiation of BF over standard care (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.24; women = 380).</P>
<P>
<B>BF education session versus standard care, pooled analyses for 'Summary of findings' (SoF)</B>
</P>
<P>This comparison does not include cluster-randomised trials reporting adjusted odds ratios. We did not downgrade any evidence for trials' lack of blinding; no trial had adequate blinding of staff and participants. The SoF table presents risk ratios for all outcomes analysed. For proportion of women exclusively BF there is no evidence that antenatal BF education improved BF at three months (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; women = 822; studies = 3; moderate quality evidence) or at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; women = 2161; studies = 4; moderate quality evidence). For proportion of women with any BF there were no group differences in BF at three (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; women = 654; studies = 2; I² = 60%; low-quality evidence) or six months (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; women = 1636; studies = 4; I² = 61%; high-quality evidence). There was no evidence that antenatal BF education could improve initiation of BF (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09; women = 3505; studies = 8; I² = 69%; high-quality evidence). Where we downgraded evidence this was due to small sample size or wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, or both.</P>
<P>There was insufficient data for subgroup analysis of mother's occupation or education.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-28 17:12:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no conclusive evidence supporting any antenatal BF education for improving initiation of BF, proportion of women giving any BF or exclusively BF at three or six months or the duration of BF. There is an urgent need to conduct a high-quality, randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Evidence in this review is primarily relevant to high-income settings.</P>

<P>Breastfeeding (BF) is well recognised as the best food source for infants (<LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2015</LINK>). Complementary foods offered before six months of age tend to displace breast milk and do not confer any health advantage over exclusive BF (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK>). BF has been advocated to improve child health, maternal health and mother-infant bonding (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2002</LINK>). BF has been associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, otitis media and allergies, better visual acuity, and speech and cognitive development (<LINK REF="REF-Innis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Innis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wold-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wold 2000</LINK>). It is also cost effective (<LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012</LINK>). Infants who are breastfed have a lower risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Horta-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horta 2015</LINK>), sudden infant death syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012</LINK>) and childhood cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Amitay-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amitay 2016</LINK>). Recent research indicates that the type of infant feeding may contribute to children becoming overweight and obese in early and late childhood. BF has been shown to protect against child obesity and cardiovascular risk outcomes and is dose related - the longer the infant is breastfed, the lower the risk (<LINK REF="REF-Arenz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arenz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harder-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane Review by <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK> indicated that exclusive BF for six months has several advantages over exclusive BF for three to four months followed by mixed BF.</P>
<P>Delay in return of fertility has been associated with frequent and long periods of exclusive BF, as well as a lower risk of developing breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Chowdhury-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhury 2015</LINK>). Women who had not breastfed their babies were four times more likely to have osteoporosis than women who had breastfed (<LINK REF="REF-Blaauw-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaauw 1994</LINK>). Better emotional health has also been attributed to women who breastfed. <LINK REF="REF-Virden-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virden 1988</LINK> found that, at one month postpartum, women who breastfed their infants had scores indicating less anxiety than women who had bottle fed their infants. The retrospective review of medical records of 800 pregnancies by <LINK REF="REF-Acheson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acheson 1995</LINK> revealed an association between lack of BF and physical and sexual abuse of the women or her children, or both. This was a small review, the results of which warrant further study. A recent published study found that women who breastfed for at least one year were less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than women who did not breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-Stuebe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuebe 2005</LINK>). Some studies have shown a benefit of BF in enhancing couple and family relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falceto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falceto 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF proposed the following standard terminology for the collection and description of data on BF behaviour; these were updated in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>), and are now widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Dettwyler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dettwyler 1992</LINK>). Breastfeeding means the infant receives breast milk but allows the infant to receive any food or liquid including non-human milk. Exclusive BF is defined as an infant being fed only breast milk, with the possible exception of vitamin D in certain populations and iron in infants of relatively low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Dewey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewey 2001</LINK>). Predominant BF is when the infant receives breast milk as the predominant source of nourishment but allows the infant to receive liquids (water and water-based drinks, fruit juice, oral dehydration solutions) and drops or syrups (vitamins, minerals, medicines) but does not allow the infant to receive anything else (in particular, non-human milk and food-based fluids). Complimentary BF is the situation when the infant receives breast milk and solid or semi-solid foods and allows the infant to receive any food or liquid including non-human milk.</P>
<P>Despite the many advantages and extensive promotion of BF, <LINK REF="REF-Susin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susin 1999</LINK> reported that the trend towards BF in many countries has been increasing slowly. However, according to the UNICEF report (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2005</LINK>), six million lives a year are being saved by exclusive BF and global BF initiation rates have risen by at least 15% since 1990. At the same time, women breastfeed for a shorter time than they intended or wished to (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2002</LINK>). The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed from birth to six months and then breastfed alongside age-appropriate, complementary feeding for two years and beyond (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-29 18:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antenatal BF education is defined as BF information being imparted during the pregnancy in a variety of forms. This could be on an individual or group basis, could include home visiting programmes, peer education programmes or clinic appointments specifically aimed at imparting BF knowledge and could involve prospective fathers or not. BF education is usually a formalised, defined, descriptive and goal-orientated programme with a specific purpose and target audience.</P>
<P>BF education differs from BF support. BF support is usually aimed at the individual person as the need arises and is defined as a person, a group or an organisation providing support in many ways. This could be psychological support (affirming and encouraging the mother), physical support (providing meals, caring for her other children, house cleaning and gardening), financial support or BF information services available to be tapped into when a BF question arises. BF support usually starts in the postnatal period, not antenatally.</P>
<P>Although we recognise the potential importance of interventions in the postnatal period on BF outcomes, the focus of this review is on antenatal BF education only, and we have not included trials examining interventions that also involve intrapartum or postpartum BF education. Other Cochrane Reviews examine BF education and support interventions in the intrapartum and postnatal periods (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sikorski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikorski 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-28 17:22:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Another Cochrane Systematic Review provides evidence that various forms of BF education are effective at increasing rates of BF initiation among women on low incomes in the USA and initiation will, therefore, not be the main focus in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>). The impact of antenatal BF education on the duration of BF, however, has not been widely reported. In Australia, more than 90% of mothers initiate BF; however, only 48% of mothers are BF at one month postpartum and only 23% maintain any form of BF at six months (<LINK REF="REF-Lund_x002d_Adams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund-Adams 1996</LINK>). Similar BF duration rates have been reported in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Raj-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raj 1998</LINK>) and Britain (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoddinott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoddinott 2000</LINK>), as well as in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 1998</LINK>). A variety of BF promotion methods including educational programmes have been studied to support the trend to increase BF duration. It is generally believed that, by improving the mothers' knowledge of BF antenatally, the rates and duration of BF would increase (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2002</LINK>). Lack of antenatal information and education about BF has been one factor attributed by New Zealand mothers interviewed about discontinuing BF (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included studies where individual women were randomised and cluster-randomised studies where, for example, clinics were the unit of randomisation. Five included studies were cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Flax-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Flax 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kools-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kools 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mattar 2007</LINK>); all of these studies report results for review outcomes with adjustments made for clustering effects.</P>

We acknowledge that the use of odds ratios prevents the pooling of these cluster trials in our main analyses (comparison 6).</P>
<P>Where there was no adjustment for cluster design effect in the published report, or where raw data were available, we adjusted the data ourselves and have presented risk ratios, because we feel this statistic is more appropriate for BF outcomes. (For example, <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2005</LINK> provides an intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) of 0.01, as well as mean cluster size and design effects for each BF outcome; we used these to adjust the sample size for outcome data in <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). If we adjusted data ourselves, we combined the adjusted data in analyses and report pooled risk ratios. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both individual and cluster-randomised trials if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>In future updates, if we identify any more cluster-randomised trials we will include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. If adjustment for the cluster design effect has not already been made by the trial authors, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions; Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6 </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>) using an estimate of the ICC derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC.</P>

<P>Four studies contributing data to our review included multiple treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Forster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forster 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kistin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kistin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mattar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlickau-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlickau 2005a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ryser-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ryser 2004</LINK> also included multiple treatment arms but did not contribute any data to this review.</P>
<P>We treated trials with three arms as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>We included two intervention arms comparing one form of BF education versus another form (group antenatal BF class and individual antenatal counselling) in Comparison 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Kistin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kistin 1990</LINK>). In this study, the third comparison arm was a control group which was not randomised and therefore not included in this review.</LI>
<LI>We included only the intervention arms comparing an information booklet, educational video and session with a lactation consultant versus the same information booklet and video without the lactation consultant session in Comparison 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Mattar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mattar 2007</LINK>), the third comparison was a control group and was included in Comparison 5.</LI>
<LI>For comparisons 1 to 5, we included more than one intervention arm compared with control, so the study ID will appear in the forest plot twice (a footnote identifies the arms). We did not split the control groups for these analyses because the trials were not pooled.</LI>
<LI>We kept intervention arms separate and split the control group to avoid double counting for pooled data in Comparison 6 (<LINK REF="STD-Forster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forster 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Schlickau-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlickau 2005a</LINK> presented continuous data, and so we compared single intervention arms with control.</LI>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager (RevMan) software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: that is, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

We have set out information about care for control groups in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, and it is important that this is taken into account in the interpretation of results. Intrapartum and postpartum care could also have an impact on BF duration; these aspects of care also varied across included studies.</P>
<P>Comparisons in the studies were mostly reported as 'routine' or 'standard' antenatal care. In 13 studies standard/routine care included some form of BF education or support (<LINK REF="STD-Finch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Finch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forster 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kluka-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kluka 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kools-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kools 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mattar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pate-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossiter-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rossiter 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlickau-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlickau 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlickau-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Schlickau 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serwint-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Serwint 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2014</LINK>).

Cluster trials presenting adjusted odds ratios were not included in this comparison. We expected substantial heterogeneity due to the different interventions and settings of trials. We used a random-effects model for all analyses with high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>; and <LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:18:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update we have included 24 studies with 10,056 women. Twenty studies involving 9789 women contributed data to the analyses. There was no evidence that antenatal breastfeeding (BF) education of any sort could improve the initiation of BF, the proportion of women with any BF and exclusive BF at three or six months as well as duration of BF over the standard care. However, It is important to mention here that of the 20 studies contributing data to this review, 13 had BF education or support as part of the standard care comparator. We have presented cluster trials with adjusted odds ratios separately in comparisons 4 and 5; most cluster trials did not contribute to the pooled effects in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-28 17:13:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two out of 24 studies were from high-income countries, mainly the USA, Australia, Canada and the UK. The only two included studies not from a high-income country were from Nigeria and Iran. Applying the results to low- and middle-income countries should be done cautiously. Although we have 24 included studies, there were diverse interventions among these studies. The overall completeness of evidence in this review is therefore too limited to make any strong conclusions or generalisations.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-29 18:28:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the comparison BF education versus standard care, we assessed five outcomes according to GRADE methodology. We did not downgrade any trial for lack of blinding, and no included trial had adequate blinding of participants or staff. We did not downgrade for substantial heterogeneity, though we have noted this on the 'Summary of findings' (SoF) table. Evidence for two outcomes was of high quality (initiation rate of BF and proportion of women with any BF at six months). A grade of high quality suggests confidence that the result is robust to future studies. Future trials should also find that antenatal education does not appear to improve uptake of BF or BF at six months. We assessed evidence for two further outcomes as of moderate quality, suggesting some doubt about the robustness of the observed effect due to small sample size in one analysis (proportion of women exclusive BF at three months) and a wide confidence interval crossing the line of effect in another (proportion of women exclusive BF at six months). Future studies may improve our understanding of the impact of antenatal education on exclusive BF at these time points. Lastly, we assessed evidence for the outcome of proportion of women with any BF at three months as of low quality, having the most uncertainly. Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for further details.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-28 17:17:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We strictly followed the review process recommended by Cochrane (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>). We obtained all relevant studies identified from search results. We independently reviewed all potentially relevant studies and resolved disagreement by discussion. Potential bias in the review process should be minimal.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-29 18:28:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of professional support interventions for BF concluded that interventions expanding from pregnancy to the intrapartum period and throughout the postnatal period were more effective than interventions concentrating on a shorter period. In addition, intervention packages using various methods of education and support from well-trained professionals are more effective than interventions concentrating on a single method (<LINK REF="REF-Hannula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannula 2008</LINK>). However, this review included not only educational but also support interventions and did not restrict the included studies to randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane Review found that health education and peer support interventions can result in some improvements in the number of women beginning to breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>). This review is currently being updated (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>). We we were unable to confirm if peer counselling was significantly better than formal BF education for initiation of BF due to small single trials in our subgroups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-28 17:18:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was not enough evidence to suggest that any antenatal BF education was more effective than standard care or any other BF education method for improving BF initiation, any BF or exclusive BF at three or six months and BF duration.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-02 10:36:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an urgent need to conduct a high-quality, randomised controlled study with an adequate sample size and that is free from commercial influence to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low- and middle-income countries where BF should have a more significant impact. It is recommended that such trials initially test the effect of individual interventions against no BF educational interventions. The no educational interventions group could be defined as no breastfeeding information or any breastfeeding information that is given in a non-formal and non-standardised way during the course of normal antenatal care consultation and would not involve any formal methods such as videos, written materials, a specific curriculum, involvement of fathers or a consultation with a lactation consultant or peer counsellor. The intervention and standard care provided in the no interventions group should be described in detail. Outcomes should include the duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding and the proportion with any or exclusive breastfeeding at 3 or 4 and 6 months as well as adverse breastfeeding outcomes such as engorgement and adverse neonatal and infant outcomes such as sepsis and respiratory infections.</P>
