<P>There are only a few good quality studies comparing the acute treatment of early episode schizophrenia with an antipsychotic medication compared to placebo or psychosocial treatment. It appears that initial medication treatment reduces the study attrition rates while also increasing the risk for medication-induced side effects. Data are too limited to assess the effects of initial antipsychotic medication treatment on outcomes for individuals with an early episode of schizophrenia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-02 13:02:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications in early episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders is common, but both short and long-term effects on the illness are unclear. There have been numerous suggestions that people with early episodes of schizophrenia appear to respond differently than those with multiple prior episodes. The number of episodes may moderate response to drug treatment.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-05 13:06:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="John R Bola">
<P>Working independently, we critically appraised records from 681studies, of which five studies met inclusion criteria. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) where possible. For continuous data, we calculated mean difference (MD). We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-16 16:24:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies (combined total n=998) met inclusion criteria. Four studies (n=724) provided leaving the study early data and results suggested that individuals treated with a typical antipsychotic medication are less likely to leave the study early than those treated with placebo (Chlorpromazine: 3 RCTs n=353, RR 0.4 CI 0.3 to 0.5, NNT 3.2, Fluphenaxine: 1 RCT n=240, RR 0.5 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNT 5; Thioridazine: 1 RCT n=236, RR 0.44 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNT 4.3, Trifulperazine: 1 RCT n=94, RR 0.96 CI 0.3 to 3.6). Two studies contributed data to assessment of adverse effects and present a general pattern of more frequent side effects among individuals treated with typical antipsychotic medications compared to placebo. One trial suggested a higher rehospitalisation rate for those receiving chlorpromazine compared to placebo (n=80, RR 2.29 CI 1.3 to 4.0, NNH 2.9). However, a higher attrition in the placebo group is likely to have introduced a survivor bias into this comparison. One study contributes data to a comparison of trifluoperazine to psychotherapy on long-term health in favour of the trifluoperazine group (n=92, MD 5.8 CI 1.6 to 0.0); however, data from this study are also likely to contain biases due to selection and attrition. One other study contributes data to a comparison of typical antipsychotic medication to psychosocial treatment on six-week outcome measures of global psychopathology (n=89, MD 0.01 CI -0.6 to 0.6) and global improvement (n=89, MD -0.03 CI -0.5 to 0.4), indicating no between-group differences. On the whole, there is very little useable data in the few studies meeting inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>With only a few studies meeting inclusion criteria, and with limited useable data in these studies, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The preliminary pattern of evidence suggests that people with early episode schizophrenia treated with typical antipsychotic medications are less likely to leave the study early, but more likely to experience medication-related side effects. Data are too sparse to assess the effects of antipsychotic medication on outcomes in early episode schizophrenia.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-04 08:46:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In early-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, clinical practice guidelines recommend intervention with conventional or atypical antipsychotic medication for at least one year (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CPA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPA 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frances-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frances 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">National 2002</LINK>). At the heart of this recommendation is an assumption that early antipsychotic treatment is beneficial. The overall risk-benefit balance is thought, in the short term (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehman 1998</LINK>) as well as long term (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1991</LINK>) to be favourable and outweighs risks of drug-induced adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Popp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popp 1998</LINK>). This is thought to be particularly true in view of the more benign adverse effect profiles of the atypical or second-generation medications.</P>
<P>The conclusion of a long-term benefit from immediate antipsychotic treatment in early episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1991</LINK>) has several far-reaching implications, including:<BR/>a. emphasising the importance of early antipsychotic treatment in psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-DeQuardo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeQuardo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falloon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falloon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewander 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linszen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linszen 1998</LINK>);<BR/>b. discouraging drug-free research on the ethical grounds of withholding a proven treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kirch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirch 1992</LINK>);<BR/>c. contributing to the psychosis may be biologically toxic hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2001</LINK>); and<BR/>d. stimulating interest in primary prevention through antipsychotic treatment of high-risk adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Cornblatt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornblatt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeGrazia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeGrazia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGlashan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGlashan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGorry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yung-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>An influential review on this important early treatment question incorporated many uncontrolled studies and used an unspecified analytic method (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1991</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis failed to find a long-term advantage from initial antipsychotic treatment in early episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Bola-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bola 2006</LINK>), yet included only published studies. The Cochrane review on chlorpromazine for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2006</LINK>) acknowledged that there may be differences in treatment response for people in their first episode of illness, such as the lower effect observed in the first-episode, multi-site, double-blind NIMH study (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1967</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2006</LINK>, however, only assesses one medication. The few available early episode studies of chlorpromazine do not permit a sensitivity analysis comparing response across episodes. In evaluating relapse rates in people who have been withdrawn from medication, <LINK REF="REF-Gaebel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaebel 2002</LINK> found different rates of relapse across treatments when comparing people in their first episodes with those later in their illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Pietzcker-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietzcker 1993a</LINK>). This suggests that episode may moderate treatment response. A related Cochrane review, <LINK REF="REF-Rummel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rummel 2003</LINK>, compares second generation antipsychotic medications with conventional (first-generation medications) in people in their first episode of illness. <LINK REF="REF-Rummel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rummel 2003</LINK> identified few relevant studies and, although outcomes such as leaving the study early did favour the newer drugs, other findings on global and mental state were not convincing.</P>
<P>In this review we examine the evidence on the effects of antipsychotic medications in early episode schizophrenia spectrum, which has a broader definition than simply first episode. There is a lack of evidence for any differential responsiveness to treatment when comparing people in their first episode with those in their second (<LINK REF="REF-Bola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bola 1998</LINK>). We therefore decided to include people in their first or second episode of psychotic illness in this review and by doing so hope to thoroughly examine the literature in relation to a pragmatic definition of early episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</P>

There is no clear evidence that the different diagnostic categories included in the schizophrenia spectrum (e.g. brief reactive psychosis, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, etc.) are caused by fundamentally different processes or require different treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>). <B>

<P>The Schizophrenia Group's trials register is based on regular searches of BIOSIS Inside, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO; the hand searching of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. A full description is given in the Group's module.</P>

<P>Reviewers (JB, DK) extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, HS independently extracted data from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. Again, we discussed any disagreements, documented decisions and, if necessary, contacted authors of studies for clarification. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included only if two reviewers independently had the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial. Ideally the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly, and we noted in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> if this was the case or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between person variability from the analysis. On the other hand calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis and we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>2.4 Skewed data</B>
</P>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered into additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means, if the sample size is large we entered this data into syntheses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, where relevant we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This was done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>a). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for typical antipsychotic training. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not improved') we reported data where the left of the line indicated an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.8 Summary of findings table</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>) and used GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Profiler" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Profiler</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan)</LINK>) to create 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes we rated as important to patient-care and decision making.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-01 18:29:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Again JB and DK worked independently to assess risk of bias by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, authors of the studies were contacted in order to obtain further information. Non-concurrence in quality assessment was reported, but if disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion. The level of risk of bias was noted in both the text of the review and in the Summary of findings tables.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, has been superseded by Summary of findings tables and calculations therein.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups. We prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, if scales of very considerable similarity are used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-10-05 13:04:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies was possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added and combined these data within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I>. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.

<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0% and 50% and where these data are not clearly described, we will present data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early are all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes we will use the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - for those who did not. We will undertake a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes are to change when 'completer' data only are compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations were not reported, we tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or T value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>): when only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) were calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formula did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>.

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We will not use funnel plots for outcomes where there are ten or fewer studies, or where all studies are of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots are possible, we will seek statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed effects model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We analysed the effects of excluding trials that were judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no further details available): allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. If the exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of the effect estimates, then data from these trials were included in the analysis</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>We also undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials where we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster randomised trials.</P>
<P>If substantial differences were noted in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we did not pool data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome, but presented them separately.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>We excluded 675 of 681 studies. The primary reason for excluding studies was the lack of a non-medication treated group. Many studies compared types of medications, including some that compared conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications. It might be reasonable to address these comparisons in a subsequent version of this review. A second main reason for excluding studies is that they were medication-withdrawal, follow-up or other types of non-acute studies that address questions other than the effectiveness of initial treatment for early episode schizophrenia psychoses. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The searches</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group provided search results that included records from 670 studies. An additional 11 studies were either known to us or suggested by reviewers. Although antipsychotic treatment of acute early episode schizophrenia psychoses is uniformly recommended around the world in published clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Gaebel-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaebel 2005b</LINK>), we found only five studies meeting inclusion criteria for this review. It is possible that we have failed to identify all relevant studies. We have as yet been unsuccessful in gaining access to unpublished data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnstone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnstone 1988</LINK>), thus we have not included these data in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-08 13:07:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found only five very short-term trials that used a total of 15 different treatments. Data reporting was generally very poor. Data were not available for all outcomes, and we could only analyse four outcomes, global state, rehospitalisation, adverse effects and leaving the study early.</P>
<P>With only a few studies meeting inclusion criteria and with limited useable data in these studies, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The data suggest that early episode patients treated with typical antipsychotic medications are less likely to leave the study early and more likely to experience medication-related side effects. Data are too sparse to assess the effects of antipsychotic medication on outcomes in early episode schizophrenia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Global outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>One study <LINK REF="STD-Mosher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mosher 1995</LINK> contributed data to a comparison of typical antipsychotic medication to psychosocial treatment on six-week outcome measures of global psychopathology (1 RCT, n=89, MD 0.01 CI -0.6, 0.6) and global improvement (1 RCT, n=89, MD -0.03 CI -0.5, 0.4), indicating no between-group differences (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). This same study did not find between-group differences on the six-week measurement of improvement in psychopathology (1 RCT, n=89, MD -0.03 CI -0.49 to 0.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-May-1976" TYPE="STUDY">May 1976</LINK>) contributed data to a two-year post-discharge comparison of global state using the Menninger Health-Sickness Scale <LINK REF="REF-Luborsky-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luborsky 1962</LINK> finding that trifluoperazine-treated individuals had higher mean scores than psychotherapy treated individuals (1 RCT, n=92, MD 5.8 CI 1.61 to 9.99) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). However, data from this study contain both selection and attrition biases.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1965</LINK>) contributed data to an eight-year post-discharge comparison of chlorpromazine versus placebo on a dichotomised rating scale (improved or not improved) that did not find a significant between group difference (1 RCT, n=40, RR 0.76 CI 0.53 to 1.11, NNT 5 CI 2.17 to 16.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2. Rehospitalisation</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rappaport-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rappaport 1978</LINK>) (n=80) suggested a higher rehospitalisation rate after two years for chlorpromazine treated completing participants compared to placebo (1 RCT, n=80, RR 2.29 CI 1.31 to 4.03, NNT 2.9 CI: 1.82 to 7.14) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Due to higher attrition in the placebo group in <LINK REF="STD-Rappaport-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rappaport 1978</LINK>, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on an intent-to-treat basis, which remains statistically significant (1 RCT, n=127, RR 2.30 CI 1.50 to 3.54, NNT 3.33 CI 2.17 to 6.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This is similar to the finding of lower rehospitalisation in the placebo treated group at the one-year follow-up to <LINK REF="STD-Cole-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1964</LINK> reported in <LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1967</LINK>. However the <LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1967</LINK> paper does not quantify the differences in rehospitalisation and the original data appear to have been lost.</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-May-1976" TYPE="STUDY">May 1976</LINK>; n=506) contributed data to an assessment of adverse effects and present a general pattern of more frequent adverse effects among individuals treated with typical antipsychotic medications compared to placebo.</P>

<P>We endeavoured to avoid publication bias; however, it is possible that all relevant studies have not yet been discovered. This review found five studies, each with methodological problems, and most with inadequate data reporting. Selection bias was apparent in one study (<LINK REF="STD-May-1976" TYPE="STUDY">May 1976</LINK>) and attrition was significant in at least two studies (<LINK REF="STD-May-1976" TYPE="STUDY">May 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rappaport-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rappaport 1978</LINK>). This review found very few studies, and available evidence does not support a conclusion that antipsychotic treatment in an acute early episode of schizophrenia is effective. This does not mean that antipsychotic treatment is not effective, only that evidence is not available to adequately evaluate its effectiveness. This is of particular concern given the widespread use of antipsychotic medications around the world in the acute treatment of early episode schizophrenia-type psychoses (<LINK REF="REF-Gaebel-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaebel 2005b</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Trials in this review preceded the international review of schizophrenia practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Gaebel-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaebel 2005b</LINK>) uniformly recommending treatment with an antipsychotic medication in early episodes. Clear reporting of outcomes would certainly have resulted in this review being more informative.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>The effectiveness of antipsychotic medications in early episode schizophrenia is under-researched and current evidence is inadequate to support international practice guideline recommendations.  Even though antipsychotic medications have been used for decades, there are only a small number of randomised, placebo-controlled trials measuring the efficacy of these medications for people with an early episode of schizophrenia. The use of antipsychotic medications for millions of people with an early episode appears based on the evidence for those with multiple previous episodes (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2006</LINK>). It is possible that early episode schizophrenia includes a higher proportion of people with a relatively better prognosis and potentially different response to treatment. Undertaking placebo-controlled trials for people with schizophrenia is problematic and many would disagree as to whether such a study was ethical (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischhacker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischhacker 2003</LINK>). There is however, some evidence that carefully conducted short-term placebo controlled trials can be conducted safely and without long-term harm to those later found to need medications (<LINK REF="REF-Bola-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bola 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnstone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnstone 1999</LINK>). We feel that one or more large, well-planned, conducted and reported randomised, placebo-controlled trials is indicated. Preliminary evidence also suggests a possible benefit from an active therapeutic milieu or other psychosocial intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Bola-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bola 2006</LINK>) that might be considered in a three- or four-arm study. Concrete and simple outcomes are of interest such as clearly reporting improvement, 'hospital admission' 'days in hospital' or even 'healthy days'. In addition, future trials need to report not only those clinically useful data but also information relating to cost effectiveness, employment, family burden, and satisfaction with care which are currently lacking. Any data on adverse effects, including those of medium- or long-term, would be most welcome. Most of these outcomes do not necessitate the use of scales as outcome measures.</P>

<P>In reviewing studies for inclusion in this review, we realised that additional focusing of our review question was needed. The initial intent of this review was to assess the evidence supporting the clinical practice guideline to treat early episodes of schizophrenia psychosis in the acute phase with antipsychotic medications. We have therefore excluded (and left for a subsequent edition of this review) studies addressing the question about medication maintenance in the post-acute phase. For example, the <LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1989a</LINK> study treated all first-episode patients in the acute phase with antipsychotic medications and, after stabilisation, randomised to two medication dosages and placebo that was followed up for two years. This, and similar studies, can address the effectiveness of maintenance medications in the post-acute phase of early episodes, but not the effectiveness of antipsychotics in the acute episode, since in that phase there was no un-medicated group. In addition, we have preliminarily excluded RCTS that compare two or more antipsychotic medications in the acute treatment of individuals with early episode schizophrenia. Subsequent editions of this review might include the medication to medication comparisons to address questions of differential medication effectiveness. Pseudo-random studies have not yet been included in this version of the review, but might be incorporated in a subsequent version of the review, along with a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of their inclusion. We have also updated the protocol method's section with the Cochrane schizophrenia group's current guidelines.</P>
