<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Platinum-based chemotherapy shows small benefit over non-platinum for advanced ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel trials were not reviewed</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ovarian cancer is the seventh commonest female cancer worldwide. Single-drug or combination chemotherapy is used routinely to treat it. This review found a small benefit in platinum-based chemotherapy over non-platinum therapy. It also found that platinum combinations may offer improved survival over single platinum and that cisplatin and carboplatin are equally effective. The trials were done when paclitaxel (an effective new drug) was not used routinely. The results therefore, will need to be looked at in the light of new evidence from paclitaxel trials.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Ovarian carcinoma is the seventh commonest female cancer worldwide and is responsible for the greatest number of deaths from gynaecological malignancy in Europe and North America. Although many studies have explored the use of chemotherapy in this disease, most individual trials have been too small to show clear benefit of any one type of chemotherapy. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The type and intensity of chemotherapy used routinely for women with advanced ovarian cancer has varied because of uncertainty about the effectiveness of the different regimens. The objective of this review was to compare single drugs versus combinations of drugs, platinum versus non-platinum, and carboplatin versus cisplatin-based chemotherapy in women with advanced ovarian cancer. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, and CancerLit bibliographic databases and the National Cancer Institute and the UK Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research registers of trials. We also handsearched the proceedings of meetings and contacted experts in the field and drug companies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials of: <BR/>(1) single non-platinum versus non-platinum combination chemotherapy <BR/>(2) single non-platinum versus platinum combination chemotherapy <BR/>(3) non-platinum regimen versus the same regimen plus cisplatin <BR/>(4) single platinum versus platinum combination chemotherapy <BR/>(5) cisplatin versus carboplatin-based chemotherapy <BR/>in women with advanced ovarian cancer. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Individual patient data were obtained from the trial investigators, checked by the reviewers and verified by the trial investigator. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Forty-nine trials involving 8763 women were included. The data were combined to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for survival on an intention-to-treat basis. For single non-platinum versus platinum combination chemotherapy the overall HR for survival was 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to1.05 favouring platinum-based combination chemotherapy. For non-platinum regimens compared with the same regimen plus cisplatin the survival HR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98 in favour of adding platinum to drug regimens. Single platinum compared with platinum combination gave a HR of 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05 favouring combination chemotherapy. Cisplatin versus carboplatin gave a HR of 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12. Sub-group analyses for age, stage, grade, histology, resection, bulk of residual tumour and performance status were undertaken for cisplatin versus carboplatin only. No difference in effect was found. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Available evidence, although not conclusive, suggests platinum-based chemotherapy is better than non-platinum therapy. There is some evidence that combination therapy improves survival compared with platinum alone. No difference in effect has been shown between cisplatin and carboplatin. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-13 11:50:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Ovarian carcinoma is the seventh most common cancer of women in the world. Some 140,000 new cases are diagnosed every year and the disease is responsible for the greatest number of deaths from gynaecological malignancy in Europe and North America (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-et-al--1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin et al 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although many studies have explored the use of chemotherapy in this disease, most individual trials have been too small to show clear benefit of one type of chemotherapy over another. Nevertheless, many of these trials have had an important influence on clinical practice, and consequently the type and intensity of chemotherapy used routinely for patients with advanced disease have fluctuated greatly over time.</P>
<P>In 1989 the British Medical Research Council (MRC) Gynaecological Cancer Working Party initiated an individual patient data meta-analysis to combine the results from all available randomised trials examining the role of platinum and of combination chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. At the outset the MRC secretariat contacted the investigators responsible for each trial, inviting their collaboration. In so doing it established the Advanced Ovarian Cancer Trialists Group (AOCTG), under whose auspices the meta-analysis was conducted. The first cycle of analyses was published in the British Medical Journal in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The AOCTG recognised the importance of updating these results especially for the comparison of carboplatin and cisplatin, where the initial data were relatively immature. The comparison of platinum analogues was considered of such clinical importance that further new investigations were initiated to identify whether any particular type of women or tumour would benefit more from either cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. These analyses were completed in 1996 and were published in the British Journal of Cancer in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Trials were identified by bibliographic searches using MEDLINE and CancerLit. This was supplemented by searching the trial registers produced by the National Cancer Institute (Physicians Data Query) and the United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research. Trials were also identified by hand searching relevant meeting proceedings, by writing to experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies and by discussion within the AOCTG. Initial bibliographic searches were done using a simple search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>), but for the update (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1998</LINK>) a modified version of the Cochrane optimal search strategy was used.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>This review is based on individual patient data obtained directly from the responsible trialist or data centre. The methods used were prespecified in a protocol. </P>
<P>Data were sought for all patients randomised in all eligible randomised trials (published or unpublished) and updated follow-up was requested. For all comparisons the following data were collected: patient identifier, treatment allocated, date of randomisation, survival status, date of last follow-up or death and whether the individual was excluded from the original analyses. For trials comparing cisplatin with carboplatin further data on age, stage, grade, histology, extent of operation, residual tumour bulk and performance status were collected at the second cycle of analyes </P>
<P>All data were checked thoroughly and the final database entries for each trial were verified by the responsible trialist or data centre.</P>
<P>All analyses were based on intention to treat. Survival analyses were stratified by trial, and the log rank expected number of deaths and variance used to calculate individual and pooled hazard ratios (HRs) using the fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-et-al-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf et al 1985</LINK>). HRs (representing the overall chance of dying on treatment as compared to control) were also calculated for pre-specified subgroups of patients using similar stratified methodology. Chi-squared tests were used to test for gross statistical heterogeneity over all trials in a comparison and between subsets of trials using the test for interaction or trend as appropriate. These tests are aimed primarily at detecting differences in effect size rather than direction and were chosen because qualitative differences were not anticipated. Survival curves were drawn as simple (non-stratified) Kaplan-Meier curves. These are not currently reproducable in the Cochrane Library but can be found in the meta-analysis publications (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1998</LINK>). Improvements or detriments to absolute survival were calculated by applying the HR to baseline survival (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1982</LINK>); proportional hazards are assumed. Baseline survivals of 45% at two years and 25% at five years were used based on the survival curves for the carboplatin/cisplatin comparison. All p-values quoted are two-sided and unless otherwise specified chi-square values are on one degree of freedom.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>At the first cycle of analysis (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>) 53 eligible randomised trials were identified. Two additional potentially eligible studies were excluded on the grounds that they were judged not to be appropriately randomised. At the second cycle of analysis four new trials were identified. In total, information was available from 49 eligible trials (8763 patients) and unavailable from eight eligible trials (502 patients). Thus data were available from 95% of all individuals randomised in known randomised trials.</P>
<P>In the first cycle of analyses, five treatment comparisons were made. However, the comparison of single-agent versus combination non-platinum drugs was not updated as it was likely to yield minimal additional data and was primarily of historical interest. For the remaining four comparisons, data were available for all but three trials (256 women) and most were able to provide updated survival information.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only trials with adequate methods of randomisation (those which did not allow prior knowledge of treatment assignment) were included. All data received were checked thoroughly to ensure both the accuracy of the meta-analysis database and the quality of randomisation and follow up in the trial. Any queries were resolved in discussion with and the final database entries verified by the responsible trial investigator or statistician.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>(1) Single non-platinum versus non-platinum combination chemotherapy</P>
<P>Data were available from 16 trials, comparing 1379 women randomised to receive a single non-platinum agent and 1767 to receive non-platinum combinations. The reason for the imbalance in numbers is that some trials used two or more combination arms. A total of 2817 deaths were observed. Data were not available from six trials which included a total of 403 patients. With the exception of a single trial [SCOCG1] which indicated a significant improvement in survival with combination chemotherapy, all the trials had wide confidence intervals and were inconclusive. The overall results were inconclusive, providing no clear evidence that for non-platinum based therapies, a single drug or combination of drugs provides greater overall survival (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.91-1.05, p = 0.42).</P>
<P>There was no gross statistical heterogeneity between trials chi-square(18) = 20.46, p = 0.31).</P>
<P>(2) Single non-platinum versus platinum combination chemotherapy</P>
<P>Data were included from a total of 11 trials including 1329 women and 1169 deaths. Data were not available for two trials which included a total of 99 patients. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-b_x002f_c-OCSG-77_x002d_61_x002d_02" TYPE="STUDY">b/c OCSG 77-61-02</LINK>) of 42 patients showed a conventionally significant benefit for combination chemotherapy, the remainder had wide confidence intervals and were inconclusive. The overall results are inconclusive (p = 0.23) but favour combination chemotherapy with an HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83-1.05), representing a 7% reduction in the overall risk of death. This translates to a suggested 3% benefit in absolute survival at both two and five years, improving survival from 45% to 48% and from 25% to 28% respectively (95% CI, 7% benefit to 2% detriment).</P>
<P>There was no gross statistical heterogeneity between trials (chi-square(10) = 16.42, p = 0.09). Excluding the small trial with the positive result (<LINK REF="STD-b_x002f_c-OCSG-77_x002d_61_x002d_02" TYPE="STUDY">b/c OCSG 77-61-02</LINK>) gives an overall HR of 0.96 (p = 0.51). </P>
<P>(3) Non-platinum regimen versus the same regimen plus cisplatin</P>
<P>Data were available from all nine eligible trials, that compared a non-platinum drug regimen with the same regimen plus cisplatin . A total of 1704 patients and 1428 deaths were included. The overall HR of 0.88 (95%CI 0.79 - 0.98) favours the addition of platinum and is marginally significant (p = 0.02). The suggested 12% reduction in the risk of death translates to a 5% improvement in survival at both two (45-50%) and five (25-30%) years (95% CI 1 to 8% benefit). Although the best evidence of a benefit is shown in the trials with a combination control arm (HR = 0.85), there is no clear evidence that the results between the two subsets of trials differ (Interaction chi-square = 0.64, p = 0.42).</P>
<P>There is no gross statistical heterogeneity between those trials with a combination control arm (p = 0.43) but, for those with single-agent control arms there is evidence of statistical heterogeneity (p = 0.02). Excluding the small positive trial (<LINK REF="STD-b_x002f_c-OCSG-77_x002d_61_x002d_02" TYPE="STUDY">b/c OCSG 77-61-02</LINK>) reduces the heterogeneity within this subset of trials (chi-square(3) = 2.18, p = 0.54) and does not alter the main results materially, with an overall HR of 0.90 (p = 0.05).</P>
<P>(4) Single platinum versus platinum combination chemotherapy </P>
<P>Data were available from all nine eligible trials and a total of 1095 patients and 894 deaths were included. One trial [GICOG 1992] showed a conventionally significant result at the 5% level, the remainder were inconclusive. Overall the results favour the use of combination chemotherapy with a HR of 0.91 (95%CI = 0.79-1.05) suggesting a 9% reduction in the overall risk of death, although this is inconclusive (p=0.21). This is equivalent to a 3% benefit in survival at both two (45-48%) and five years (25-28%) (95% CI, 8% benefit to 2% detriment). </P>
<P>There is no evidence of gross statistical heterogeneity between trials (chi-square(8) = 10.35, p = 0.24).There is perhaps some visual suggestion of a qualitative interaction, that cisplatin-based trials favour combination chemotherapy (HR = 0.86, p = 0.07) whereas carboplatin-based trials favour single drug therapy (HR = 1.05, p = 0.21). However, the carboplatin result is based on a relatively small number of events and confidence intervals are wide such that there is no clear evidence of a difference in effect between the results for these groups of trials (Interaction chi-square = 1.76, p = 0.18)</P>
<P>If the Royal Marsden trial [Royal Marsden 1986] is excluded from the analysis, because it compared a high dose cisplatin on its own with low dose cisplatin plus chlorambucil, the overall HR is 0.88 (p = 0.08 ) and the HR for cisplatin-based trials is 0.80 (p = 0.02).</P>
<P>(5) Cisplatin versus carboplatin</P>
<P>Data were available from all 12 eligible trials which compared cisplatin and carboplatin either as single agents or each in combination with the same drugs in multi-drug regimens. In total this includes 2219 patients and 1745 deaths. Data from one further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Belpomme-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Belpomme 1992</LINK>) including 157 women were unavailable. The results of individual trials are very consistent and there is no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. There is no good evidence of any difference between cisplatin and carboplatin when given either as a single drug (HR = 1.01, p = 0.92) or in combination (HR = 1.02, p = 0.74) (Interaction chi-square = 0.003, p=0.96). The overall HR of 1.02 (p = 0.74) suggests a 2% benefit of cisplatin, but the confidence intervals are such that it could be consistent with modest benefits of either drug. In terms of absolute survival at both two and five years, the 95% confidence interval is consistent with improvements in overall survival of 3% benefit for cisplatin and 4% benefit for carboplatin.</P>
<P>Survival curves for the above comparisons are presented in the meta-analysis publications (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1998</LINK>)</P>
<P>Treatment effects in different sub-groups</P>
<P>Different patient subgroups were analysed using data provided for 11 of the trials included in the carboplatin/cisplatin comparison (all except one trial [Japan] for which this information was not available.) There is no good evidence that any group of women specified by age (interaction chi-square = 0.18, p = 0.67), stage (trend chi-square = 0.64, p = 0.42), performance status (interaction chi-square = 0.68, p = 0.41), residual tumour bulk (interaction chi-square = 0.68, p = 0.41), extent of operation (trend chi-square = 0.04, p = 0.84), histology (interaction chi-square(6) = 11.56, p = 0.07) or grade (interaction chi-square = 2.30, p = 0.13) do any better or worse when treated with either cisplatin or carboplatin. There is perhaps some suggestion that stage II tumours may benefit more from cisplatin. However, very few stage II tumours were included, the confidence intervals are wide and it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the result</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results for the comparison of single non-platinum drugs versus platinum-based combinations, which is undoubtedly the most clinically heterogeneous comparison, tend to favour platinum combination chemotherapy. However, the confidence limits are such that the results remain inconclusive. For the comparison of the addition of platinum to otherwise similar drug regimens, the results are marginally significant (at conventional levels) in favour of platinum. An absolute benefit of around 5%, at two and five years is suggested. Given that there are now few patients at risk for whom additional follow up will be possible in either of these comparisons, it is unlikely that these results will change over time unless further large trials emerge. Thus these results will probably remain the best and least biased estimates of the benefits of platinum-based therapy over non-platinum regimens (which were mostly based on alkylating agents). When interpreting these results, however, it should be appreciated that many women in these trials are likely to have received platinum on relapse from which they may have derived a late benefit, and that drugs were sometimes administered at doses and schedules that would not be considered adequate today. Thus, in effect these comparisons are likely to be comparing a policy of immediate versus delayed platinum-based therapy. The results therefore suggest that the policy of giving immediate platinum-based treatment results in better overall survival than delaying such treatment until relapse.</P>
<P>The results for the comparison of single-agent platinum with platinum in combination are inconclusive, but for the cisplatin-based trials there is a strong trend in favour of combination chemotherapy. These results are driven largely by the GICOG multi-centre Italian trial [GICOG 1992] which contributes 50% of the total information. In most of these studies the dose of platinum used as a single-agent was lower than is currently standard and the observed difference could be attributable to the higher total drug dose in the muliple drugarms rather than combination chemotherapy per se. For these trials there are reasonable numbers of patients for whom further follow up is possible. It may therefore be important to update this analysis in future and to incorporate data from currently ongoing trials. If, as these results suggest, there may be a modest advantage of combination chemotherapy, then it is important to have a good estimate of effect with tight confidence intervals as the trade-offs involved and the subsequent choice between the two types of treatment is not necessarily straightforward. In such circumstances precise estimates of any survival differences are essential.</P>
<P>The comparison of cisplatin and carboplatin show no obvious advantage of one compound over the other in terms of survival. These results appear very consistent across trials. Data were not available for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Belpomme-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Belpomme 1992</LINK>) whose preliminary results showed a significant prolongation of median survival for cisplatin. As far as is known this trial, which prohibited the crossover to cisplatin, has never been published in full. As in other comparisons, this meta-analysis compares treatment policy, in this case the policy of immediate cisplatin versus immediate carboplatin. The individual patient data collected for this meta-analysis shows that crossover rates during the treatment period were not excessive and are comparable on each treatment arm. With the exception of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-e-Royal-Marsden-1981" TYPE="STUDY">e Royal Marsden 1981</LINK> , <LINK REF="STD-e-Mayo-Clinic-846151" TYPE="STUDY">e Mayo Clinic 846151</LINK>), comprising 10.6% of the total patients, such crossover rates were less than 10%. However, it remains likely that patients may have been treated with the alternative platinum analogue on relapse if this happened outside the period of primary treatment. Thus the comparison could in fact be one of immediate versus delayed treatment with the two platinum compounds. It will be important to update this analysis in future, looking at long-term survival, especially since the results are somewhat inconsistent with those found in testicular cancer, where cisplatin has been shown to be superior to carboplatin (<LINK REF="REF-Bajorin-et-al-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajorin et al 1993</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Horwich-et-al-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horwich et al 1994</LINK>). However, the consistency of the results in the sub-group analyses lends support to the interpretation that neither drug is superior in terms of improving overall survival in advanced ovarian cancer. There was no good evidence that cisplatin was more or less effective in any particular pre-defined subgroup of patients and therefore no good grounds for selecting women on the basis of age, performance status, extent of operation, tumour stage, residual bulk, grade or histology to receive one or other treatment. The somewhat extreme HR in favour of cisplatin in stage II tumours is based on very small numbers of patients. Owing to this, and the increased possibility of false positive results owing to multiplicity of subgroup analysis, this result should certainly not be regarded as anything more than hypothesis generating. It should be noted that trials included in the meta-analysis do not include recent and ongoing randomised trials using taxanes as a component of combination chemotherapy. Future updates will aim to include data from these trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Just as no clinical trial can provide prescriptions of how to treat individual cases, neither can a meta-analysis. Although not conclusive the results suggest that platinum based chemotherapy is better than non-platinum therapy, that platinum combinations may offer improved survival over single-agent platinum and that cisplatin and carboplatin are equally effective. However patients are not uniform in their preferences and the trade-offs between choosing more and less intensive therapy are not always straightforward. Ultimately the treatment chosen is to be decided by the patient and clinician and will depend on many factors including toxicity and quality of life in addition to survival estimates. However the results of this meta-analysis provide the current most reliable estimates of the relative survival benefits of the treatments studied to be used as part of this decision making process.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Currently much research effort is focussed on paclitaxel, but it is still not clear what should be used as the appropriate 'control' arm in these trials. These results sugest that this should be either platinum as a single-agent or in combination. If the latter, this should probably be the CAP regimen which a separate meta-analysis has shown to be superior to CP (<LINK REF="REF-OCMP-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">OCMP 1991</LINK>). However, in that meta-analysis, the doses of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide were similar in the two treatment arms and the observed difference could therefore have been attributable to either the addition of doxorubicin or to higher total doses of drug on the CAP arm. The full results of ICON2 (<LINK REF="REF-Torri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torri 1996</LINK>), comparing CAP with single-agent carboplatin, are awaited with interest. When these results are available, taken together with the results presented here, the best 'standard' therapy may be identified which can be used as the baseline against which to measure current and future drug development.</P>
