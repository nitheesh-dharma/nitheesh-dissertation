<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Oral magnesium supplementation for high blood pressure in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review examined whether taking magnesium supplements could be recommended for treating adults with high blood pressure from no known cause. It reviewed 12 trials enrolling 545 people, which compared magnesium supplementation with a dummy drug (placebo) or no treatment, and measured blood pressure 8 weeks to 6 months later. The results of trials varied a lot: some trials found magnesium lowered blood pressure much more than placebo, while others found little difference between magnesium and placebo. On average, people receiving extra magnesium achieved slightly lower diastolic blood pressure at the end of trials. None of the studies reported any serious side effects of taking magnesium supplements.</P>
<P>However, most included trials were of poor quality, so their results may not be reliable. The trials were not long enough or large enough to measure whether extra magnesium can reduce possible consequences of high blood pressure: death, heart attack or stroke. </P>
<P>The review did not find robust evidence that oral magnesium supplementation reduces high blood pressure in adults. Larger, longer duration, better quality trials are needed to clarify whether magnesium supplementation can lower high blood pressure.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Epidemiological evidence on the effects of magnesium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up &#8805;8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#8805;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#8805;85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve RCTs (n=545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5, I<SUP>2</SUP>=67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9, I<SUP>2</SUP>=47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>High blood pressure, or hypertension, is associated with a variety of structural changes in the blood vessels and heart which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. It is one of the ten leading risk factors influencing the global burden of disease and is estimated to lead to over 7 million deaths each year, about 13% of the total deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Reducing blood pressure levels is associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSC 2002</LINK>). The most common form of hypertension, occurring in around 95% of all cases, is primary hypertension which is defined as high blood pressure with no identifiable cause (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>). Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure with an identifiable cause, e.g. renal disease or endocrine disturbances.</P>
<P>The epidemiological evidence about the effects of dietary magnesium intake on blood pressure is inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ma-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizushima-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizushima 1998</LINK>). Although several studies suggest that higher levels of magnesium in the diet are associated with lower blood pressure, this association is not easy to interpret, firstly because of the difficulty in estimating accurately a person's intake of magnesium and, secondly, because the amount of magnesium in diet is correlated with that of other nutrients that may modify blood pressure. Furthermore, conflicting results may be due to the effect of magnesium supplementation being influenced by dietary magnesium intake, type of medication, or level of hypertension. </P>
<P>Although metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure, the mechanism by which magnesium deficiency might increase blood pressure is a matter of speculation (<LINK REF="REF-Buemi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buemi 2002</LINK>). Studies in both animals and humans provide substantial evidence of a complex relationship between electrolytes: sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Magnesium is a vasodilator when infused into veins and arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Teragawa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teragawa 2001</LINK>) and can cause a small but significant reduction in blood pressure (4/3 mmHg) in the short term (<LINK REF="REF-IMAGES-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IMAGES 2004</LINK>). Magnesium regulates the physical properties of cellular membranes and their permeability, and could therefore alter the permeability of cells for calcium and sodium, which is important in the development of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1989</LINK>). It has also been hypothesised that an impairment in ionic metabolism may lead to an increase in intracellular calcium and a reduction in intracellular magnesium - characteristic features of hypertension - with a consequent alteration in sodium balance, which could raise blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Resnick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnick 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found one systematic review and one meta-analysis summarising the findings of randomised controlled trials of oral magnesium supplements on blood pressure. The systematic review of trials in hypertensive populations found no clear evidence of benefit of magnesium supplements and did not recommend it as a treatment for hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1999</LINK>). The meta-analysis of 20 trials in both hypertensive and normotensive populations reported a small but non-significant reduction in blood pressure overall, but estimated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of around 4.3 mmHg and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of around 2.3 mmHg for every 240 mg/day increase in magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence about the benefits and harms of dietary magnesium supplementation for patients with primary hypertension, in order to inform decisions about recommendations for treatment. Ideally, we would assess the benefits and harms from the effects of the supplements on the risk of mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes - heart attack and stroke. However, as trials of nutritional supplements are usually small and short-term, these outcomes are rarely reported; we therefore concentrated on BP measurements, which are correlated wtih cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We also summarised evidence about adverse effects, such as gastro-intestinal disturbances. </P>

</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a parallel or crossover design that had an intervention period of at least 8 weeks and allowed an intention to treat analysis. Crossover trials were restricted to designs with 2 interventions and 2 treatment periods.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults over 18 years of age, with elevated blood pressure (a minimum of 140 mmHg for SBP or 85 mmHg for DBP), without a known primary cause. The inclusion criterion for diastolic blood pressure is slightly lower than the standard (90 mmHg) for hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-VII-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VII 2003</LINK>), in order to include individuals at the lower end of the spectrum of raised blood pressure. We excluded:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>studies of pregnant women, since hypertension during pregnancy is often due to syndromes such as preeclampsia, with a pathophysiology different from that of other forms of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>studies including patients on antihypertensive medication which varied during the course of the study, since the results of such studies are potentially confounded.</LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention: oral magnesium supplements, or dietary interventions which manipulated only magnesium intake; </LI>
<LI>Control: placebo, no treatment, or usual care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We excluded trials which combined change in magnesium intake with other interventions: for example, those that aimed to increase magnesium while reducing sodium intake, and those that changed several aspects of diet.</P>

<LI>SBP at end of follow-up;</LI>
<LI>DBP at end of follow-up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>If the mean or standard deviation of final BP was not reported, the difference in BP between randomisation and the end of the study (change score) was used instead, if its standard deviation was available. If BP was measured both supine and standing, supine measurements were preferred; if BP was measured both sitting and supine, sitting measurements were preferred. If blood pressure was measured in clinic and at home or in the workplace, clinic measurements were preferred. If only ambulatory blood pressure was measured, 12/7 was added to these measurements, as the British Hypertension Society recommends an upward correction of 12/7 mmHg to ambulatory values before comparing them with clinic values (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1999</LINK>).</P>

<LI>total withdrawals from treatment;</LI>
<LI>withdrawals due to adverse effects;</LI>
<LI>adverse effects (gastro-intestinal disturbances, other);</LI>
<LI>serum magnesium levels at end of follow-up: although not specified in the initial protocol this was abstracted and post-hoc meta-analysis performed. Final values or change scores were abstracted as for blood pressure (see above).</LI>

<P>There was no language restriction.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were screened independently by two reviewers and those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Copies of the full text of potentially relevant references were obtained and their eligibility was assessed by one of two methods: one reviewer was primary assessor and decisions were checked by a second reviewer, or assessments were done independently by two reviewers. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third reviewer. </P>
<P>Methodological quality of included trials was assessed independently by two reviewers using the following criteria:</P>
<P>
<U>Blinding</U> <BR/>We coded the blinding of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<U>Randomisation</U>
<BR/>We coded the randomisation of participants to intervention groups as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, e.g. a computer-generated random sequence or a table of random numbers;</LI>
<LI>inadequate, e.g. date of birth, clinic id-number or surname;</LI>
<LI>unclear, e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<U>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</U>We coded the concealment of the allocation sequence from treatment providers and participants as:<U>
<BR/>
</U>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (A) i.e. where the allocation sequence could not be foretold;</LI>
<LI>inadequate (B) e.g. a method of allocation which allowed treatment providers to predict which arm of the trial the next participant was assigned to; this included use of sealed opaque envelopes;</LI>
<LI>unclear (C) e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<U>Loss to follow-up</U>
<BR/>We recorded the number of participants in each intervention arm whose blood pressure was not reported at the end of the study; we noted if loss to follow-up was not reported.</P>
<P>
<U>Carryover effects<BR/>
</U>For crossover trials, we noted whether carryover effects were assessed and, if so, whether any were detected.<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>Two reviewers independently abstracted endpoint data and data which might facilitate interpretation of any heterogeneity in the findings of trials: country in which the study was conducted, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline (age, gender, ethnicity, mean blood pressure, whether previously treated with antihypertensive drugs), trial quality, and duration of follow-up using a pre-specified form. Differences were reconciled by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. Authors were contacted for missing endpoint data.<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>The findings of all included trials were aggregated in separate meta-analyses for (i) crossover and (ii) parallel designs; these were combined in the same meta-analysis if they did not show heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002</LINK>). For meta-analysis of parallel trials separately, final SBP and DBP (and standard deviations) in magnesium and control arms were input to the weighted mean difference facility of RevMan. For crossover trials separately, and for parallel and crossover trials combined, the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan was used. The mean difference (and standard deviation) between final blood pressure for magnesium and control interventions for both SBP and DBP was calculated. If standard deviations of final values were not available, change scores were used if their standard deviations were available. If no standard deviations were available, they were imputed. In particular, the standard deviation of the crossover treatment effect was imputed (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), assuming the mean within-person correlation observed in other crossover trials which evaluated the effect on blood pressure of oral supplements of calcium, sodium and magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Australian-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australian 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galloe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galloe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kawano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawano-1998-_x0028_ii_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawano 1998 (ii)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarron-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarron 1985</LINK>). For factorial trials, the effect of magnesium was estimated by comparing effects among participants assigned and not assigned to magnesium, assuming no interaction between magnesium and the other intervention. Mean differences were weighted according to the precision of each trial and combined in meta-analyses using a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), to estimate an overall pooled weighted mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Sub-group analyses were performed, grouping the trials into those in which (i) participants in the active treatment arm received higher (&gt;15mmol/day) and lower (&lt;=15 mmolday) doses of magnesium, (ii) participants' mean baseline systolic blood pressure was higher (SBP&gt;150 mmHg) and lower (SBP&lt;=150 mmHg), and (iii) percentage of male participants (&lt;=50%, &gt;50%). </P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding trials which did not report (i) adequate concealment of allocation, (ii) blinding of both participants and treatment providers, and (iii) sufficient data to allow estimation of the standard deviation of the treatment effect. A post-hoc analysis was performed, excluding one trial which had very different findings compared to the other trials<I>. </I>Further post-hoc analyses comprised: (i) evaluation of the effect of magnesium supplementation on serum magnesium levels using similar methods to above, and (ii) meta-regressions (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2001</LINK>), to evaluate whether the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP varied with dose of magnesium, the percentage of male participants, or initial BP.</P>
<P>For parallel trials, we assessed the tolerability of the intervention by calculating the difference in the rate of withdrawal in treatment and control arms, and using a random effects model to calculate a pooled risk difference. Crossover trials are designed with the intention that all participants receive both the active and control interventions, and the treatment effect is estimated from the differences in response of the same participant to the different treatments. Hence participants who withdraw from either treatment cannot be included in the analysis and so the question of differential withdrawal between treatment arms does not arise. </P>
<P>We assessed gastro-intestinal adverse effects by calculating the difference in the rate of these effects in treatment and control arms, and using a random effects model to calculate a pooled risk difference.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search strategy found 304 potentially relevant references which we electronically screened (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We excluded 277 references and retrieved 27 for detailed evaluation.<I> </I>Of these, we excluded 15 references reporting 14 trials for the following reasons: normotensive participants (six trials), follow-up of less than eight weeks (four trials), the intervention consisted of multiple supplements (one trial, two references), participants not randomly allocated to the sequence of treatment (one trial), medication varied during the trial (one trial), and observational study (one trial) - see table <B>Characteristics of Excluded Studies</B>. The 12 remaining RCTs met our inclusion criteria and are described in the table <B>Characteristics of included studies</B>. </P>

One trial evaluated hawthorn and magnesium using a factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2002</LINK>).

<P>The number of participants in each trial ranged from 13 to 91. There was substantial heterogeneity between trials. The median duration of follow-up was 11 weeks, (range: 8 weeks to 26 weeks). Entry criteria varied between trials, but participants' mean baseline SBP ranged from 143 to 173 mmHg and their DBP from 88 to 97 mmHg. Overall mean blood pressure at baseline was 148/91 mmHg. All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1986</LINK> reported gender and in these 45% of the participants were male. One trial was restricted to women (<LINK REF="STD-Witteman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Witteman 1994</LINK>). The overall mean age was 54 years (range: 20 to 77 years).

<P>Most trials did not report any details of the normal diet of participants; one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Witteman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Witteman 1994</LINK>) reported that treatment and control groups did not differ significantly on their dietary intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium or energy at baseline. <I> </I> One trial advised all participants to reduce their intake of sodium chloride <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Plum_x002d_Wirrel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Plum-Wirrel 1994</LINK>) and one trial placed all participants on a low sodium (50-70 mmol/day) diet (<LINK REF="STD-Nowson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nowson 1989</LINK>). All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Nowson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nowson 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2002</LINK> reported that mean serum electrolyte levels were within the normal reference range at baseline in both treatment and control groups. <BR/>

<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>The intervention was provided as a simple oral magnesium supplement taken as a tablet or powder stirred in water, between one and six times per day, varying between trials.

<P>Although all twelve studies claimed to be randomised, the method of randomisation was confirmed to be adequate in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2002</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Wirell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wirell 1994</LINK>: one heart attack)<I>,</I> we were able to meta-analyse only blood pressure, adverse effects, overall withdrawals from treatment and serum magnesium levels. </P>
<P>
<B>Primary meta-analyses<BR/>
</B>Two trials found a statistically significant reduction in SBP and DBP among participants receiving magnesium compared to those receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Borrello-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Borrello 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kawano 1998</LINK>); and two trials reported a significant reduction in DBP alone (<LINK REF="STD-Wirell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wirell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witteman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Witteman 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of nine parallel trials found magnesium supplements compared to placebo had little effect on SBP (mean difference: 0.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.2 to 4.8) or DBP (mean difference: -2.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.1 to 0.1) - see comparison 1. There was substantial heterogeneity between trials for both SBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%) and DBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%), largely reflecting the inconsistency between the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Borrello-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Borrello 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1992</LINK>. <B>

</B>The meta-analysis of three crossover trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kawano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kawano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plum_x002d_Wirrel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Plum-Wirrel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wirell 1994</LINK>) confirmed that they had consistent results and showed that overall participants receiving magnesium supplements had a small, statistically significant reduction in both SBP (mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.5 to -1.5, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and DBP (mean difference: -2.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.1 to -1.0, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) compared to control - see comparison 2.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>As the confidence intervals of the treatment effects for the nine parallel and three crossover trials overlapped substantially (for both SBP and DBP), we combined these trials in a single meta-analysis. This showed that, overall, participants receiving magnesium supplementation had no significant difference in SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5) compared to control, but achieved a small, statistically significant reduction in DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9) - see comparison 3. There was substantial heterogeneity between trials for both SBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%) and DBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%), reflecting the heterogeneity already found within parallel trials. </P>
<P>This heterogeneity was not explained by differences in magnesium dose: <I> </I>although<I> </I>trials administering higher (&gt;15 mmol/day) doses of magnesium showed greater net reductions in systolic blood pressure in the magnesium group than trials administering lower doses (&lt;=15mmol/day), the difference between the high and low dose trials was not statistically significant - see comparison 3. High and low dose trials showed similar changes in diastolic blood pressure. Heterogeneity between trials was apparent only among the low dose trials. <I> </I>
</P>
<P>The heterogeneity was not explained by differences in baseline blood pressure: although trials whose participants had higher baseline blood pressure (&gt;150 mmHg SBP) showed greater net reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the magnesium group than trials whose participants had lower baseline blood pressure (&lt;=150 mmHg SBP), the difference was not statistically significant (- see comparison 4). </P>
<P>The heterogeneity in SBP was not explained by differences in the proportion of males among the participants, whereas this was a possible explanation for the heterogeneity in DBP. Although trials enrolling a lower proportion of males (&lt;=50%) showed greater net reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the magnesium group than trials enrolling a higher proportion of males (&gt;50%), the difference was statistically significant only for DBP where it accounted for the statistical heterogeneity between trials - see comparison 5. </P>

We therefore conducted a further post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding these poor quality trials. A meta-analysis of the remaining 10 trials found magnesium supplementation had no effect on SBP (mean difference: 0.4 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.1 to 3.3) and achieved a small significant reduction in DBP (mean difference -2.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.6 to -0.3) - see comparison 6.

<B>Sensitivity analysis excluding the Paolisso 1992 trial</B>
<BR/>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK> had an unusually high baseline BP (mean = 173/96 mmHg) and reported an effect of treatment much larger than that found in the other studies (mean difference in SBP: -12.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -29.5 to 5.5; mean difference in DBP: -6.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -17.4 to 5.4). We therefore conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding this trial. A meta-analysis of the remaining 11 trials resulted in a smaller reduction in SBP which was still non-significant (mean difference: -1.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.8 to 1.7) and an unchanged significant reduction in DBP (mean difference -2.1 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.8) - see comparison 8.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>Effect of intervention<BR/>
</B>12 RCTs enrolling 545 participants, with between eight weeks and six months follow-up, met the review inclusion criteria. The trials were not designed to assess the effects of magnesium supplementation on mortality or cardiovascular events and only three trials reported such events. Meta-analysis of blood pressure outcomes showed that, overall, magnesium supplementation was associated with a small, statistically significant reduction in DBP but little change in SBP. However, as it is very unusual for an agent to lower DBP more than SBP (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>), these findings for DBP should be interpreted with caution. Further, magnesium supplementation had little effect on serum magnesium levels, which is not surprising as it is known that magnesium is poorly absorbed orally (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trials which are not blinded are more likely to report beneficial effects of the intervention than other trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis excluding trials which did not blind both participants and treatment providers showed similar results to the main analysis. Moreover, restriction of the analysis to the two trials which additionally blinded outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Borrello-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Borrello 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK>) resulted in overall statistically significant net reductions in both SBP and DBP. This finding may not be generalizable, firstly because participants in these trials had higher mean baseline BP than those in most of the other trials and, secondly, because all participants in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK> had been receiving thiazide diuretics for over a year and may therefore have been suffering intracellular magnesium loss. Although these trials were triple blinded, they did not report adequate concealment of allocation, which has been shown to be associated with over-estimation of the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the findings of the trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62% and 47% for SBP and DBP respectively), which could reflect heterogeneity in either the patient populations, the interventions or the methods used in the trials. The possible modifying effects of dose of magnesium and initial blood pressure were evaluated by sub-group analysis, which showed no evidence that they influenced the effect of treatment. Hence it seems unlikely that either dose of magnesium or baseline blood pressure explains the heterogeneity. Trials with 50% or fewer men showed a significantly greater net reduction in DBP in response to magnesium supplementation than other trials, but meta-regression showed no significant trend of the treatment effect with the percentage of male participants. The contrasting findings of the sub-group analysis and the meta-regression are partly because two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2002</LINK>) had exactly 50% men and the meta-regression did not require arbitrary assignment of these trials to one sub-group. The apparently significant difference in DBP outcomes in the sub-group analysis between trials with a high percentage of male participants and others is likely to be a chance finding, as the pattern of results for DBP differed from that for SBP. Findings from multiple subgroup analyses can be misleading as subgroup analyses are observational by nature and not based on randomised comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>). False negative and false positive significance tests increase in likelihood rapidly as more subgroup analyses are performed. Other differences between the populations studied, e.g. dietary sodium or magnesium status, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, were not amenable to sub-group analysis. While methods of measurement of BP varied between trials, this is unlikely to explain the heterogeneity between trials as the same methods of measurement were used for both treatment and control groups within trials. When we excluded trials which did not confirm blinding of both the participant and the treatment provider, heterogeneity between trials changed little; likewise when we excluded trials which did not report the standard deviation of the treatment effect. When the trial reporting the greatest reduction in BP among participants receiving magnesium <LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK> was excluded, the results changed little and substantial heterogeneity remained. <I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Funnel plots showed little evidence of publication bias.</P>
<P>Withdrawals were reported by treatment arm in eight trials enrolling 391 participants; both the rate of withdrawal for all causes and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects were similar in magnesium and control groups. </P>
<P>Adverse effects were reported by treatment arm in six trials enrolling 330 participants. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gastro-intestinal symptoms. The rates of all adverse effects, of gastro-intestinal symptoms and of other adverse effects were similar in magnesium and control groups. Although two serious adverse events - a blood coagulation defect and a myocardial infarction - were reported in crossover trials, they cannot be ascribed to magnesium supplementation as the trials did not report which treatment the participants were receiving when these events occurred.</P>
<P>
<B>Previous findings<BR/>
</B>Our main findings - that magnesium supplementation has little effect on blood pressure - are consistent with those of a previous systematic review which did not include a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK>) differed from ours in many aspects: it was not restricted to trials in hypertensive populations with at least 8 weeks follow-up and did not exclude trials in which participants received antihypertensive medication which varied during the course of the trial. Although it included eight trials which we also included (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kawano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lind-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lind 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nowson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nowson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plum_x002d_Wirrel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Plum-Wirrel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witteman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Witteman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zemel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Zemel 1990</LINK>), it also included 12 trials which we excluded - six trials in normotensive populations (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Purvis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purvis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-1992" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP 1992</LINK>), four trials of less than eight weeks duration (<LINK REF="STD-Cappuccio-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cappuccio 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reyes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Reyes 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanjuliani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanjuliani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Widman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Widman 1993</LINK>), one trial in which antihypertensive medication varied (<LINK REF="STD-Dyckner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dyckner 1983</LINK>) and one trial which was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK>). It excluded four trials which we included - two trials identified from searches of a database (CENTRAL) which <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> did not search (<LINK REF="STD-Borrello-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Borrello 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paolisso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paolisso 1992</LINK>), one trial published after <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> completed their review (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2002</LINK>) and the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Wirell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wirell 1994</LINK>. Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> analysed the difference between blood pressure at baseline and the end of the study (change scores) whereas we analysed blood pressure at the end of the study (final values), and <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> analysed ambulatory/home blood pressure from the study of <LINK REF="STD-Kawano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kawano 1998</LINK>, whereas we analysed BP measured in clinic.<BR/> <BR/>Nevertheless, the two reviews were consistent in finding that, overall, magnesium supplementation had little effect on the blood pressure of hypertensive people: <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> reported overall reductions in SBP (mean difference = -3.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.8 to 0.1) and in DBP (mean difference = -2.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.6 to 1.0 ), consistent with our findings of reductions in SBP (mean change = -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5) and in DBP (mean difference = -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9). The reviews were discordant in their explanation of differences between trials: <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> concluded that blood pressure reduction was significantly greater in participants with higher initial blood pressure, whereas we did not. If such an effect exists, the review of <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> is more likely than ours to detect it, as their review included trials with a wider range of initial blood pressure: our review was restricted to trials in hypertensive populations. <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> also concluded that blood pressure reduction was significantly greater in participants who received larger doses of magnesium (i.e. a dose-response), whereas we did not. The difference is largely due to the influence of a small trial (n=13) with the largest dose of magnesium (40 mmol/day, <LINK REF="STD-Zemel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Zemel 1990</LINK>). Baseline systolic blood pressure in this trial was 145 and 140 mmHg in the treatment and control groups respectively, a difference which could easily have occurred by chance despite randomisation (p=0.5). This difference resulted in a substantial difference between the estimates of the effect of treatment made by <LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK> using change scores and made by us using final values (increases of 4 and 9 mmHg respectively), which was sufficient to change the conclusions regarding a possible dose-response. While it has been argued that it is better to use change scores than final values in a meta-analysis as they allow for differences between participants at baseline, the recommendation in the latest version of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>) is that: "Although sometimes used as a device to 'correct' for unlucky randomisation, this practice is not recommended." There are several reasons for this recommendation:<BR/>- in a meta-analysis of endpoint blood pressure, differences between groups at baseline tend to average out over the included trials,<BR/>- use of change scores involves two sources of measurement error, whereas use of final values involves only one, <BR/>- to exploit the extra precision gained by inclusion of additional cross-over trials, it is essential to analyse the final value rather than the change score as the former is likely to be more highly correlated within individuals and so lead to a more precise estimate of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although epidemiological studies have reported an association between a higher magnesium intake and lower blood pressure in women (<LINK REF="REF-Acherio-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acherio 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kesteloot-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kesteloot 1988</LINK>), we found no robust evidence that the effect of magnesium supplementation differed between men and women. While it is plausible that a biological mechanism specific to women may make them more susceptible to blood pressure reduction with magnesium supplementation than men, these epidemiological findings may have occurred by chance. </P>
<P>The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial found a diet high in fruit and vegetables was effective in reducing blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Conlin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conlin 2000</LINK>). While this diet was high in magnesium, it also high in other nutrients and low in fat and cholesterol, so it is difficult to identify the specific effective components.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>Our meta-analysis demonstrated a small, statistically significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure and no reduction in systolic blood pressure with magnesium supplementation as compared to control. It found no evidence that magnesium supplementation is associated with adverse effects. However, for several reasons - the trials were of poor quality and had inconsistent results, magnesium supplementation had little effect on serum magnesium levels, magnesium is known to be poorly absorbed orally, and it is unusual for an agent to lower DBP more than SBP (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>) - we conclude that the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak. It is our opinion that, as poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment, the apparently significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure is most likely to be due to bias. </P>
<P>Even if increasing magnesium intake results in a reduction in diastolic blood pressure, this reduction is small, 2.2 mmHg, is not known to be sustained beyond 26 weeks and is not known to cause a decrease in morbidity and mortality. This is compared to the evidence for drugs, which singly result in average reductions of about 9.1 mmHg (95%CI: 8.8 to 9.3) in SBP and 5.5 mmHg (95%CI: 5.4 to 5.7) in DBP (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>), are known to have sustained effects and to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, even small changes in blood pressure in large proportions of the population in a common condition such as hypertension could reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Hence, if a clear sustained effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure were established, an increase in dietary magnesium at a population level could have important benefits.<B>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We did not find robust enough evidence that dietary magnesium supplementation reduced raised blood pressure to justify its use as a treatment for elevated blood pressure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More placebo controlled trials are warranted to clarify whether magnesium supplementation can reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. These trials should be randomised, with adequate concealment of allocation of participants to treatment arms, and blinding of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors. They should enrol a large number of participants and have long enough follow-up to allow detection of any meaningful long-term effects of magnesium supplementation. The question of whether the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure varies with dose of magnesium, gender or baseline blood pressure should ideally be evaluated within such high quality RCTs, as comparisons between trials are likely to be confounded by other differences between trials. </P>
