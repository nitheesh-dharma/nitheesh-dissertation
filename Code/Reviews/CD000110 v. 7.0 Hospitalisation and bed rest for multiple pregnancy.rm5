<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:15:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>We found no strong evidence that bed rest in hospital for women with a multiple pregnancy decreases the risk of a preterm birth. Multiple pregnancies have a higher risk of preterm (early) birth and poor growth of the babies than a single pregnancy. Bed rest during the latter half of pregnancy has been widely used as a policy for women carrying more than one baby. This was to reduce the risk of preterm birth and restricted fetal growth and to improve the health of both the mother and her babies. We identified seven controlled trials involving 713 women who were randomly offered bed rest in hospital or only admitted to hospital if complications occurred, and 1452 babies. In five of the trials the women were carrying twins, triplets in the other two trials.</P>
<P>Bed rest did not show benefits for women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy. Overall, routine bed rest in hospital for multiple pregnancies did not reduce the risk of preterm birth or perinatal deaths. There was a suggestion of a decrease in the number of low birthweight infants (less than 2500 g) when women were routinely hospitalised. Only one trial provided information about what women thought about their care in the routinely hospitalised group. While a small number appreciated admission, a number found it psychologically distressing. Four of the seven trials were conducted in Harare, Zimbabwe.</P>
<P>The review of trials found routine bed rest in hospital did not decrease the risk of a preterm birth, but may improve growth of the infants. Benefits of bed rest in hospital for women with triplets were seen but these could equally have been due to chance.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>We included seven trials which involved 713 women and 1452 babies. Routine bed rest in hospital for multiple pregnancy did not reduce the risk of preterm birth, or perinatal mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity related to perinatal death and stillbirth unaccounted for by trial quality. There was a suggestion of a decreased number of low birthweight infants (less than 2500 g) born to women in the routinely hospitalised group (risk ratio (RR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.00). No differences were seen in the number of very low birthweight infants (less than 1500 g). No support for the policy was found for other neonatal outcomes. No information is available on developmental outcomes for infants in any of the trials.</P>
<P>For the secondary maternal outcomes reported of developing hypertension and caesarean delivery, no differences were seen. Women's views about the care they received were reported rarely.</P>
<P>In the subgroup analyses for women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy, with cervical dilation prior to labour with a twin pregnancy and with a triplet pregnancy, no differences were seen in any primary and secondary neonatal outcomes and maternal outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-17 00:07:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently not enough evidence to support a policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy. No reduction in the risk of preterm birth or perinatal death is evident, although there is a suggestion that fetal growth may be improved. For women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy the results of this review show no benefit from routine hospitalisation for bed rest. Until further evidence is available, the policy cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:15:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Multiple pregnancy is associated with increased fetal (the unborn baby) and neonatal (the baby from birth to four weeks of age) mortality compared with singleton pregnancy, and morbidity is high amongst survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2005</LINK>). The higher the order of multiple pregnancy, the greater the risk of mortality and morbidity. The majority of perinatal (referring to the period of time before, during, and the first week after birth) deaths are associated with preterm birth and intrauterine (inside the uterus) growth restriction. Fetal growth is reduced from 27 to 30 weeks in twins and from the 27th week in triplets compared with singletons (<LINK REF="REF-McKeown-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeown 1952</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions for multiple pregnancy that reduce the risk of early birth and/or the risk of poor fetal growth would be an important advance in care. Based on observational studies in the early 1950s that identified improved perinatal outcome in twins born to middle-class women (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1952</LINK>), the suggestion that 'admitting to hospital all twin mothers at the 30th week in order by diet and rest to tide them over the danger period' became widely accepted into obstetric practice. No evidence was produced to show the benefits expected from such a practice. Hospitalisation is often a disruptive and stressful experience for women and their families. In addition, hospitalisation is costly to the health services.</P>
<P>Women at especially high risk of preterm birth might be expected to derive greatest benefit from hospitalisation for bed rest if effective. Beneficial effects of hospitalisation for bed rest might include prolongation of pregnancy to achieve greater fetal maturation at birth, improvement in fetal growth and optimal intrapartum (referring to the period of time during labour and birth) management, as labour if early would begin in hospital. Women with a triplet or higher order multiple pregnancy have an increased risk of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction compared with women having twins. Similarly, women with a twin pregnancy who have evidence on cervical assessment of cervical effacement and dilatation (low cervical score) are at increased risk of preterm birth compared with women who have an uncomplicated twin pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Houlton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houlton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1988</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effect of hospitalisation for bed rest in women with a multiple pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth, fetal and neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and women's satisfaction with their care.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis for combining data where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were are judged sufficiently similar. Where we suspected clinical or methodological heterogeneity between studies sufficient to suggest that treatment effects may differ between trials, we used random-effects meta-analysis.</P>
<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, we noted this and repeated the analysis using a random-effects method.</P>
<P>The denominator for maternal outcomes was the number of women; the denominator for neonatal outcomes was the number of babies.</P>
<P>We synthesised data separately for studies with a low risk of bias and those with a high risk of bias to explore the impact of possible bias on review findings.</P>
<P>When appropriate, we synthesised data from studies where results were expressed as dichotomous and continuous data. We involved the project statistician before attempting to synthesise different measures of treatment effect.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Analyses of all trials</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy did not reduce the risk of preterm birth, or perinatal mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity related to perinatal death and stillbirth unaccounted for by trial quality. There was a suggestion of a decreased number of low birthweight infants (less than 2500 g) in the routinely hospitalised group which reached borderline levels of statistical significance (risk ratio (RR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.00; 7 trials; 1452 babies). No differences were seen in the number of very low birthweight infants (less than 1500 g).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neonatal and maternal secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No support for the policy was found in the secondary neonatal outcomes reported, which included depressed Apgar scores (less than seven), need for admission and length of stay of seven days or more on the neonatal unit. No information was available on developmental outcomes for infants in any of the trials.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For the secondary maternal outcomes reported of developing hypertension and caesarean delivery, no differences were seen. One trial provided information about what women thought about their care in the routinely hospitalised group (<LINK REF="STD-Maclennan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Maclennan 1990</LINK>): 6% 'appreciated admission' and 18% found hospitalisation for bed rest 'psychologically distressing'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Analyses of hospitalisation for bed rest in women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation) was not reduced for routine bed rest in hospital for women with uncomplicated twin pregnancy, nor was the risk of very preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation). No differences were seen in perinatal mortality, and there was substantial heterogeneity related to perinatal death and stillbirth unaccounted for by trial quality. No differences were seen in the measures of neonatal weight. No differences were seen for the neonatal secondary outcomes or maternal outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Analyses of hospitalisation for bed rest in women with a triplet pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Most of the comparisons made between the hospitalised and control groups suggest beneficial treatment effects from routine hospitalisation for bed rest. However, the identified differences between the two groups were not statistically significant and the confidence limits around these treatment effects were wide. All the differences observed between the experimental and control groups were compatible with chance variation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Analyses of hospitalisation for bed rest in women with a twin pregnancy complicated by cervical effacement and dilatation prior to labour</HEADING>
<P>No differences were seen when compared the hospitalisation for bed rest group with the control group in the risk of preterm birth, perinatal mortality, fetal growth, the neonatal secondary outcomes, or in any of the maternal outcomes.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-12-03 11:03:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no sound evidence to support a policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest for women with a multiple pregnancy. No reduction in the risk of preterm birth or perinatal death is evident, although there is a suggestion that fetal growth may be improved. The available evidence suggests the policy to be of no benefit for women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy.<BR/>
<BR/>There has been no long-term follow up of developmental outcome of infants in any of the trials to date. Similarly there is a paucity of information about how women and their families feel about this form of care. The minimal information available suggests that many women find routine hospitalisation distressing.</P>
<P>These seven trials provide only limited evaluation of the policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy and provide no good evidence to support the use of the policy. Four of the seven trials were conducted in Harare, Zimbabwe. The effect of the policy should be known for other obstetric populations and other racial groups.<BR/>
<BR/>The scanty evidence available for women with a triplet pregnancy highlights the need for further research to help clarify whether there are real benefits of hospitalisation that outweigh the social and financial costs. To ensure a trial of adequate size to be able to detect small but clinically important differences, a multinational, multi-centred collaborative trial would be needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:15:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is currently no sound evidence to support a policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy. For women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy, the results of this review suggest no benefit. Until further evidence is available to the contrary, the policy cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>In women with triplets, although mainly beneficial effects of the policy were observed, it must be reiterated that these could all be ascribed to chance variation, and do not provide a basis for adoption of the policy into clinical practice.</P>
<P>For women with a twin pregnancy at high risk of preterm birth, because of signs of cervical effacement and dilatation prior to labour, there is, so far, no basis for the adoption of the policy into clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:15:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy was introduced into clinical practice without adequate controlled evaluation of its efficacy. The policy has been subjected to limited well-controlled evaluation.</P>
<P>Further evaluation of the policy in women considered at higher than average risk of preterm birth and at gestational ages considered at greatest risk would seem appropriate. Further assessment of the favourable effects on fetal growth observed is warranted. Four of the seven trials were conducted in Harare, Zimbabwe. The effect of the policy needs to be known in other obstetric populations and other racial groups.</P>
<P>Any future trials should provide long-term developmental outcomes for the infants, assess women's views of the care received assess costs.</P>
<P>For women with a triplet pregnancy, the policy has not been fully evaluated, and an international, multi-centre trial would be necessary.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-04 17:15:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartikainen_x002d_Sorri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hartikainen-Sorri 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maclennan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Maclennan 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1985</LINK>.</P>
<P>Included trial data were processed as described in <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials under consideration were evaluated for inclusion and methodological quality. There was no blinding of authorship.</P>
<P>Quality scores for concealment of allocation were assigned to each trial, using the criteria described in Section 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>)<BR/>A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, D = not used.</P>
<P>In addition, quality scores were assigned to each trial for completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome assessment as follows:-</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness of follow-up:</HEADING>
<P>(A) &lt; 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 3% - 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) 10% - 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(D) 20% or more excluded;<BR/>(E) unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For blinding of assessment of outcome:</HEADING>
<P>(A) Double-blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.<BR/>(B) Single-blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation. Or, the trial is described as double-blind, but side effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (&gt;= 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified.<BR/>(C) No blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment.<BR/>(D) Unclear.</P>
<P>Data were extracted by the reviewer and double entered. There was no blinding of authorship. Whenever possible, unpublished data were sought from investigators.</P>
<P>Descriptive data included authors, year of publication, setting, country, time span of the trial, pretrial calculation of sample size and number randomised and analysed. Categorical data were compared using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between trials was tested for using the chi-squared test with n (the number of trials contributing data) minus one degrees of freedom. With no significant heterogeneity (p &gt; 0.10), data were pooled using a fixed-effect model. If significant heterogeneity was found, the random-effects model was used.</P>
<P>All eligible trials were included in the initial analysis and sensitivity analyses have been carried out to evaluate the effect of trial quality. This was done by excluding trials given a D rating for quality for allocation concealment. Further analyses explored the effect of hospitalisation for bed rest in women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy, in women with a triplet pregnancy and women with a twin pregnancy complicated by cervical effacement and dilatation prior to labour.</P>
