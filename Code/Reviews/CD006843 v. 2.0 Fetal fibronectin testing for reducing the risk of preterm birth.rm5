<P>Preterm birth before 37 weeks is the main cause of death and sickness for newborn infants. While most women have preterm labor symptoms such as contractions before having a preterm birth, most such women with symptoms deliver at term (greater than or equal to 37 weeks). Fetal fibronectin is a test that can identify the women with symptoms of preterm labor most at risk for preterm birth by measuring the level in secretions from the vagina and/or cervix. This review of five controlled studies that randomised 474 pregnant women did not find enough evidence to support or refute the use of the fetal fibronectin test for the management of women with symptoms of preterm labor. Further research should be encouraged.</P>

<P>Fetal fibronectin (FFN) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein localized at the maternal-fetal interface of the amniotic membranes, between chorion and decidua, where it is concentrated in this area between decidua and trophoblast.

Levels greater than or equal to 50 ng/mL at or after 22 weeks have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth.

<P>Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women between the gestational ages of 22 and 34 weeks screened with FFN for risk of preterm birth.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 05:49:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 13 trials, of which five were eligible for inclusion. The five included studies randomized 474 women, of which 235 were randomized to knowledge and 249 to no knowledge of FFN.</P>
<P>Preterm birth less than 37 weeks was significantly decreased with management based on knowledge of FFN results (15.6%) versus controls without such knowledge (28.6%; risk ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.87). All other outcomes for which there were available data (preterm birth at less than 34, 32, or 28 weeks; gestational age at delivery; birthweight less than 2500 grams; perinatal death; maternal hospitalization; tocolysis; steroids for fetal lung maturity; and time to evaluate) were similar in the two groups. No other maternal or neonatal outcome was available for meaningful analysis.</P>

<P>Although FFN is commonly used in labor and delivery units to help in the management of women with symptoms of preterm labor, currently there is not sufficient evidence to recommend its use. Since this review found an association between knowledge of FFN results and a lower incidence of preterm birth before 37 weeks, further research should be encouraged.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Importance of preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>Preterm birth is defined by the World Health Organization as birth between 20 and 36 6/7 weeks. Its incidence is about 5% to 8% in most developed and developing countries. This incidence is increasing in many countries, including developing countries.<BR/>
<BR/>Preterm birth is the main cause of neonatal morbidity and mortalities in most countries, especially in developed countries. In the USA, 75% of perinatal mortality occurs in preterm babies; more than two-thirds of perinatal mortality (60% of total) occurs in infants born at less than 32 week. Mortality and morbidities are inversely associated with gestational age at birth. Morbidities include respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, retinopathy, etc. All members of a family in which a preterm birth occurs suffer greatly, in several aspects, including medically, socially, psychologically, and financially.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions to reduce preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>Despite extensive research efforts, the incidence of preterm birth is increasing in many countries. It has increased to 12.9% in 2006 in the USA (a greater than 20% increase in the last 10 years), representing more than 500,000 births in this nation alone. Preterm birth can be spontaneous, and follow preterm labor (50%), or preterm premature rupture of membranes (30%); or be iatrogenic (20%). The interventions that have been shown to effectively reduce the risk of preterm birth or improve outcomes for babies born preterm in asymptomatic women have been smoking cessation counselling for smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2004</LINK>); antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2001</LINK>); intramuscular progesterone for women with prior preterm birth now carrying a singleton gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2006</LINK>); ultrasound-indicated cerclage in women with both a prior preterm birth and shortening of cervical length less than 25 mm before 24 weeks in the current singleton pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2005</LINK>); and history-indicated cerclage in women with three or more prior preterm births or second trimester losses (<LINK REF="REF-Drakeley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drakeley 2003</LINK>). In symptomatic women, corticosteroids (betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly for 2 doses 24 hours apart between 24 and 33 6/7 weeks is preferred if available) given to mother prior to preterm birth are effective in preventing RDS, IVH, and neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors are the only class of primary tocolysis shown to decrease preterm birth before 37 weeks in women with preterm labor compared to placebo, but this effectiveness is based on less than 100 randomized women (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Fetal fibronectin to predict and reduce preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>Fetal fibronectin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. Fetal fibronectin in biologic fluids is produced by amniocytes and by cytotrophoblast. It is present throughout gestation in all pregnancies. It is not subject to genetic polymorphism. There are very high levels in amniotic fluid (100 µg/mL) in the second trimester, and 30 µg/mL at term. It is localized at the maternal-fetal interface of the amniotic membranes, between chorion and decidua, where it is concentrated in this area between decidua and trophoblast. Here it acts as a 'glue' between the pregnancy and the uterus. Concentration of fetal fibronectin protein found in blood is 1/5 that found in amniotic fluid; it is not present in urine. In normal conditions, this glycoprotein remains in this area between chorion and decidua, and very low levels are found in cervico-vaginal secretions after 22 weeks (less than 50 ng/mL). Levels above this value (greater than or equal to 50 ng/mL) at or after 22 weeks in the cervico-vaginal secretions collected by a swab have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth.<BR/>
<BR/>The fetal fibronectin test assesses risk of preterm labor and preterm birth by measuring amount of fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions. In fact, fetal fibronectin is one of the best predictors of preterm birth in all populations studied so far, including low- and high-risk women without preterm labor, twins, and women in preterm labor (<LINK REF="REF-Leitich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 1999</LINK>). The overall sensitivity and specificity are 56% and 84% for preterm before 37 weeks, respectively, but vary according to gestational age at collection, population studied, prevalence of preterm birth, single versus multiple screening, etc (<LINK REF="REF-Leitich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 1999</LINK>). Its positive predictive value varies from about 9% to 46% depending on the incidence of preterm labor in the population studies (<LINK REF="REF-Leitich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 1999</LINK>). Even at 13 to 22 weeks, higher (using 90th percentile) fetal fibronectin levels are associated with a two- to three-fold increase risk in subsequent spontaneous preterm labor.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-12 07:34:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our search identified 13 trials, of which five were eligible for inclusion. We identified no quasi-randomized trials. We excluded seven of the eight excluded studies because they only included women with positive or only with negative fetal fibronectin (FFN) results. The other excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Kalchbrenner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kalchbrenner 1999</LINK>) did not report data regarding the results of the FFN test, with no management reported based on FFN results.</P>
<P>The five included studies randomized 474 women, of which 235 were randomized to knowledge and 249 to no knowledge of FFN. Of the included studies, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ness 2007</LINK>) used knowledge of both FFN and transvaginal ultrasound cervical length for management interventions. We requested patient-level databases from all authors, and obtained them from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ness 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plaut-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Plaut 2003</LINK>), and additional information (but not the database) from one other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grobman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grobman 2004</LINK>), despite multiple attempts with the other authors. Our analysis was based on singleton gestations, and this was possible for all included studies, except for <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2002</LINK> (unclear if twins included) and <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2004</LINK> (eight twins included). We avoided repeated entries of the same patients, which was possible since we had patient-level data for the one trial where this occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Plaut-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Plaut 2003</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 05:35:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of selection bias was not present in four of the five included studies. The fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2002</LINK>) did not describe allocation concealment (only the abstract of this study has been published).</P>
<P>All randomized patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Grobman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grobman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ness 2007</LINK>). This could not be assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2002</LINK>), which was reported only as an abstract. Approximately 12% of randomized patients were excluded from analysis after randomization in the other two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plaut-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Plaut 2003</LINK>). Attrition bias in terms of loss of data on outcomes analysed was 21% in <LINK REF="STD-Plaut-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Plaut 2003</LINK>, and even higher for some outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Ness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ness 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>Performance bias was present in all trials, as participants and researchers were aware of the arm to which they were randomized, but this was inevitable.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 05:50:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth before 37 weeks was significantly decreased with management based on knowledge of FFN results (15.6%) versus controls without such knowledge (28.6%; risk ratio (RR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.87). All trials had RRs less than one, with no significant heterogeneity. All other outcomes for which there were available data (preterm birth less than 34, 32, or 28 weeks; gestational age at delivery (weeks); birthweight less than 2500 grams; perinatal death; maternal hospitalisation; tocolysis; steroids for fetal lung maturity; and time to evaluate) were similar in the two groups. No other maternal or neonatal outcome was available for meaningful analysis.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were not feasible, since all women included had signs and symptoms of preterm labor; low-risk singleton gestations were not reported separately from high-risk (e.g. prior preterm labor) singleton gestations; there were insufficient data for multiple gestations, timing of availability of results, and gestational age at collection of FFN to make meaningful comparisons.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 05:35:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Knowledge of fetal fibronectin results in the management of women with symptoms of preterm labor is associated with a lower incidence of preterm birth before 37 weeks. As all our available outcomes were not affected, and no perinatal outcome other than perinatal death was reported, further research is necessary before fetal fibronectin testing can be recommended in this clinical scenario. Furthermore, it is still unclear which interventions are most beneficial once fetal fibronectin results are known. In fact, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ness 2007</LINK>) reported a detailed protocol of management based on fetal fibronectin (and cervical length) results, and could be replicated in further research trials or clinical management. Our review did not include, by design, assessment of effectiveness of interventions based on positive fetal fibronectin testing, or negative fetal fibronectin testing. We identified no trials on women without signs or symptoms of labor.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-02-13 14:40:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although fetal fibronectin is marketed and commonly used in labor and delivery units to help in the management of women with symptoms of preterm labor, currently there is not sufficient evidence to recommend its use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-23 05:38:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since this review found an association between knowledge of fetal fibronectin results and a lower incidence of preterm birth before 37 weeks, further research should be encouraged, minimizing attrition bias. Future studies should include specific populations (e.g. singleton gestations with symptoms of preterm labor), a study group managed with a protocol based on the fetal fibronectin results, and report not only maternal but also significant perinatal outcomes. Cost-effect analyses are also needed.</P>
