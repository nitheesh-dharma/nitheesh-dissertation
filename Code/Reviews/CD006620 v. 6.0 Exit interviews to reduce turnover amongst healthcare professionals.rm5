<P>In many healthcare organisations, exit interviews are conducted to try to understand why staff are leaving the facility. These interviews may be held before the individual leaves or after they have left the organisation; they may be face-to-face interviews or conducted by telephone. The main purpose of the exit interview is to reduce the number of people who leave, by fixing problems that may be identified during the exit interview process. This review sought to determine if the exit interview was useful in achieving this purpose. However, after a wide search, no studies answering the question were found. Further research in this area is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-21 22:33:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of condition</HEADING>
<P>Turnover is defined as "the process whereby staff resign from the organization or transfer within the hospital environment" (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-Jones-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland Jones 1990</LINK>). It is a problem that affects all organisations and has become a focus of healthcare institutions because of high replacement costs. In <LINK REF="REF-Wise-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wise 1993</LINK>, this phenomenon is defined as an erosion of human resources within an organisation resulting in an increase in the cost of doing business. Unfortunately, when health care is involved the end result of turnover can impact on patient care and clinical outcomes. Turnover has been a focus of interest for organisations since the early 1900s (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1986</LINK>). It can be viewed as beneficial to an organisation to a certain degree, stopping it from becoming stagnant and non-productive (<LINK REF="STD-Weisman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Weisman 1981</LINK>). Tai et al suggest that in any organisation, trying to retain staff and keep turnover rates at an acceptable level is beneficial. In healthcare facilities turnover rates range between 10.1% and 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Tai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tai 1998</LINK>), however rates between 15% and 20% annually are considered acceptable to prevent an organisation becoming stagnant (<LINK REF="REF-Capko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capko 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of intervention</HEADING>
<P>Exit interviews are conducted in many organisations to elicit reasons for employee turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Leahey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leahey 1991</LINK>). The practice dates back over half a century (<LINK REF="STD-Melcher-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Melcher 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 1956</LINK>) and takes the form of either a formal or informal verbal interchange, conducted at a point between the time of resignation and the employee's last working day; a written questionnaire, completed either before or after leaving the organisation; or a combination of both approaches. The exit interview can be defined as "a widely used tool for gathering information from separating employees" (<LINK REF="REF-Giacalone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giacalone 2003</LINK>, p.398). An excellent summation of the process is "that the scope of inquiry is not simply why employees quit their jobs, but the impact of the total work environment on those who chose to stay" (<LINK REF="REF-Drost-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drost 1987</LINK>, p.104). Although there is argument for and against the exit interview, it remains a recommended component of the exiting process. Well accepted reasons for conducting such interviews include: attempting to change the person's mind about leaving; using the interview as part of an 'image management' exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Lefkowitz-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefkowitz 1969</LINK>); documenting specific reasons for the resignation so that managers can use the information to improve the service (<LINK REF="REF-Erickson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leahey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leahey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neidermeyer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neidermeyer 1987</LINK>); and, more recently, to 'trend' reasons for turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Erickson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 1996</LINK>). An exit interview also provides organisational feedback about unethical or bad behaviour and information about current practices, working conditions, management and training programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Drost-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drost 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giacalone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giacalone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jurkiewicz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jurkiewicz 2001</LINK>). In ideal circumstances the employee is interviewed by someone other than the line manager; information is then gathered and analysed and fed back to managers and executives in a timely manner.</P>
<P>Although the exit interview is widely used, the validity of the approach has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Jurkiewicz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jurkiewicz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefkowitz-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefkowitz 1969</LINK>). There are often inconsistencies in the way the interview is managed, and it may be conducted by people who are unskilled in interview techniques. The exercise is costly and information may not be analysed and fed back in a timely manner, or may be disregarded completely. More importantly, the information elicited may not be accurate. For example, departing employees may wish to leave a good impression to improve chances of a positive future reference or re-employment (<LINK REF="REF-Hinrichs-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinrichs 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yourman-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yourman 1965</LINK>). They may feel intimidated about discussing the true reason for leaving, especially if conflict is involved and the interview is conducted well before the person's departure date; or they may feel that disclosing their real reason is a waste of time, based on previous experience with the service (<LINK REF="REF-Yourman-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yourman 1965</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>The intervention under consideration in this review is the exit interview and the primary outcome is staff turnover. In theory, the exit interview reduces turnover by alerting management about organisational deficits or problems that may be amenable to quality improvement activities. Responding to concerns raised during the exit interview provides the organisation with a reputation of caring, which may, in turn, contribute to staff retention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review?</HEADING>
<P>There is a worldwide shortage of healthcare professionals<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>), so many strategies have been utilised in an attempt to reduce this phenomena, the exit interview being just one of them. This review is timely and important because retaining healthcare professionals has become a priority for most countries around the world. To understand the organisational environment, the manager must be aware of the tools available to assist them in trying to reduce turnover and retain staff. The exit interview is one such tool, but whether it is effective in reducing turnover or the number of healthcare professionals who leave the profession is still disputed.</P>

<P>We planned to base primary analyses on consideration of dichotomous outcome measures (for example, the proportion of healthcare professionals leaving). When studies reported more than one measure for each endpoint, we planned to extract the primary measure (as defined by the authors of the study) or the median measure identified. We planned to present the results for all comparisons using a standard method of presentation where possible.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-15 14:03:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Despite the large number of published articles about exit interviews, we have been unable to identify any trials or other high quality studies that have assessed the value of exit interviews to reduce turnover amongst healthcare professionals. We found some anecdotal accounts of reductions in turnover after the introduction of exit interviews, but no data were provided to substantiate these statements (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2003</LINK>). This is disappointing in view of the widespread nature of the practice.</P>
<P>Costs associated with replacing staff may be considerable and have been extensively studied (<LINK REF="REF-Mukamel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukamel 2009</LINK>). It therefore seems intuitively sensible to question staff about their reasons for leaving, if this results in organisational changes that lead to lower turnover rates. However, the effectiveness of exit interviews remains unknown, as does the most appropriate method for conducting such interviews.</P>
<P>This review has identified an important gap in turnover research. There is an urgent need for high quality studies to provide managers with evidence to guide decisions about approaches to exit interviews.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 07:51:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-11 00:04:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Joan Webster">
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of exit interviews to reduce turnover is currently not available. Consequently, a range of uncertainties remain about the practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-05 07:51:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Rigorous studies, designed to compare exit interview strategies, are required to inform decisions about healthcare interventions to reduce turnover. Any future studies should include participants from a variety of healthcare settings (e.g. acute, aged care, community), compare interviewers (line managers or independent) and involve interventions such as in-depth interviews, phone interviews or paper-based surveys administered before the person leaves the organisation; and interviews, either by phone or face-to-face, or paper-based surveys after the person leaves the organisation. These interventions may be compared with each other or with no planned exit interview strategy. The inclusion of formal, planned economic analyses in any future trial would be very useful to healthcare administrators.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that studies linking exit interview strategies directly with turnover may be complex. Outcomes may be influenced by a variety of interventions which emerge from exit interview data. Consequently, it may be useful to undertake studies that evaluate the impact of exit interviews on intermediate and final outcomes, such as sick leave absence or measures of organisational culture, using an interrupted time series approach, in line with evaluations of other complex interventions. Any such interventions would need to be clearly documented and defined.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods of sequence generation are computer-generated random sequence, coin toss (for studies with two groups), rolling a dice (for studies with two or more groups), drawing of balls of different colours, dealing previously shuffled cards.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.<BR/>- Quasi-randomised approach: examples of inadequate methods are alternation, birth date, social insurance/security number, date in which they are invited to participate in the study, and hospital registration number.<BR/>- Non-random approaches: allocation by judgement of the clinician; by preference of the participant; based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; by availability of the intervention.</P>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>Assignment must be generated independently by a person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the participants. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about whether the person is eligible to enter the trial. Examples of adequate methods of allocation concealment are: central allocation, including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation; sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.<BR/>Examples of inadequate methods of allocation concealment are: alternate medical record numbers; unsealed envelopes; date of birth; case record number; alternation or rotation; an open list of random numbers any information in the study that indicated that investigators or participants could influence the intervention group.</P>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>Randomisation stated but no information on method of allocation used is available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Was the participant blinded to the intervention?</I>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable?</I>
</P>
<P>The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given.</P>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>- If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow up and 30% for long-term follow up and does not lead to substantial bias (NB. these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature).<BR/>- No missing outcome data.<BR/>- Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).<BR/>- Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.<BR/>- Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.<BR/>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</P>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>Insufficient reporting of of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of 'yes' or 'no'.</P>
<P>
<I>Were all randomised participants analysed in the group to which they were allocated? (intention to treat (ITT) analysis)</I>
</P>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>Specifically reported by authors that ITT was undertaken and this was confirmed on study assessment, or not stated but evident from study assessment that all randomised participants are reported/analysed in the group they were allocated to for the most important time point of outcome measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.<BR/>- Lack of ITT confirmed on study assessment (patients who were randomised were not included in the analysis because they did not receive the study intervention, they withdrew from the study or were not included because of protocol violation) regardless of whether ITT reported or not.<BR/>- &#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</P>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>Described as ITT analysis, but unable to confirm on study assessment, or not reported and unable to confirm by study assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>If all the results from all prespecified outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial.This information is either obtained by comparing the protocol and the final trial report, or in the absence of the protocol, assessing that the published report includes enough information to make this judgment. Alternatively a judgement could be made if the trial report lists the outcomes of interest in the methods of the trial and then reports all these outcomes in the results section of the trial report.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.<BR/>- Not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported.<BR/>- One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified.<BR/>- One or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).<BR/>- One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.<BR/>- The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>Insufficient information to permit judgement of 'yes' or 'no'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Other sources of potential bias</HEADING>
<P>Yes, low risk of bias.<BR/>The study appeared to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
<P>No, high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>used an inappropriate study design;</LI>
<LI>was stopped early due to some data-dependent process;</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalances; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to be fraudulent.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Unclear.<BR/>There may be a risk of bias but there is insufficient information to permit judgement of whether other risks of bias exist.<BR/>
