<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-05 10:52:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>When a person's heart stops beating it may be necessary to deliver an electrical shock (called 'defibrillation') to the person's chest to restart their heart. Two electrodes are placed on the person's chest to allow the defibrillator to deliver the electrical shock. Historically, the electrical current applied to the chest has travelled in one direction between the electrodes. More recently, defibrillators have been designed to send the electrical pulse in one direction and then in the reverse direction. This is known as a 'biphasic' waveform. </P>
<P>
<B>Objective</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers conducted this review to determine whether the newer biphasic waveform defibrillators are better at restarting a person's heart than the 'monophasic' waveform defibrillators previously used.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to 10 September 2014 and tried to find all available research (published and unpublished) that compared these two types of defibrillators. We only included trials with a high-quality study design to avoid the possibility of inaccurate results.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Four trials (552 participants) met the inclusion criteria of our review. Several included trials were potentially at risk of misleading results due to features of their study design. When we combined these trial results, we found that using the newer biphasic waveform defibrillators may be associated with lower failure rates of restarting a person's heart, but these results were imprecise. There was no difference in the number of people who were alive on arrival at the hospital or who were discharged from the hospital alive. No included trials reported on side effects or operator safety.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>We are uncertain as to whether biphasic defibrillators have an important effect on being able to restart a person's heart because the results were imprecise.</P>

<P>Transthoracic defibrillation is a potentially life-saving treatment for people with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and haemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT). In recent years, biphasic waveforms have become more commonly used for defibrillation than monophasic waveforms. Clinical trials of internal defibrillation and transthoracic defibrillation of short-duration arrhythmias of up to 30 seconds have demonstrated the superiority of biphasic waveforms over monophasic waveforms.

<P>We searched the following electronic databases for potentially relevant studies up to 10 September 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Also we checked the bibliographies of relevant studies and review articles, contacted authors of published reviews and reviewed webpages (including those of device manufacturers) relevant to the review topic. We handsearched the abstracts of conference proceedings for the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, European Resuscitation Council, Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Regarding language restrictions, we did not apply any.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-05 08:02:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared biphasic and monophasic waveform defibrillation in adults with OHCA. Two review authors independently screened the literature search results.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-05 08:03:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We resolved any disagreements by discussion and consensus. The primary outcome was the risk of failure to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes included risk of failure to revert VF to an organised rhythm following the first shock or up to three shocks, survival to hospital admission and survival to discharge.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-05 10:48:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four trials (552 participants) that compared biphasic and monophasic waveform defibrillation in people with OHCA. Based on the assessment of five quality domains, we identified two trials that were at high risk of bias, one trial at unclear risk of bias and one trial at low risk of bias. The risk ratio (RR) for failure to achieve ROSC after biphasic compared to monophasic waveform defibrillation was 0.86 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.20; four trials, 552 participants). The RR for failure to defibrillate on the first shock following biphasic defibrillation compared to monophasic was 0.84 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; three trials, 450 participants); and 0.81 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.09; two trials, 317 participants) for one to three stacked shocks. The RR for failure to achieve ROSC after the first shock was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.04; two trials, 285 participants). Biphasic waveforms did not reduce the risk of death before hospital admission (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; three trials, 383 participants) or before hospital discharge (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.42; four trials, 550 participants). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity in any of the pooled analyses. None of the included trials reported adverse events.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-05 10:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). About 25% of people with ischaemic heart disease present with sudden cardiac arrest (<LINK REF="REF-Keuper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keuper 2007</LINK>). In Europe alone there are an estimated 275,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) per year due to coronary artery disease where resuscitation is attempted (<LINK REF="REF-Atwood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atwood 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) as the first recorded rhythm in people with OHCA is difficult to determine, with rates as low as 16.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Nishiuchi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishiuchi 2003</LINK>) and as high as 63.3% reported (<LINK REF="REF-Waalewijn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waalewijn 1998</LINK>). With the deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), first responders can access people with OHCA before emergency medical services arrive. The incidence of VF/VT as the first recorded rhythm may be as high as 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2000</LINK>). VF/VT is the most salvageable rhythm in cardiac arrest and electrical countershock or "defibrillation", the definitive treatment, can be given out of hospital.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-04 20:55:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transthoracic defibrillation is a potentially life-saving treatment for people with VF and haemodynamically unstable VT. VF is characterised by chaotic electrical activity in the person's heart. The resulting absence of coordinated myocardial contraction leads to cessation of forward blood flow from the heart. The lack of cardiac output quickly leads to cerebral, myocardial and end organ death.</P>
<P>In recent years biphasic waveforms have become more commonly used for defibrillation than monophasic waveforms. Biphasic waveforms are characterised by an initial positive current flow followed by a reversal to negative current flow. Extensive research with implantable defibrillators and transthoracic defibrillation of short-duration VF/VT has shown that these waveforms are able to defibrillate with less energy than monophasic, requiring lower voltage and, hence, smaller and lighter battery and capacitor banks (<LINK REF="STD-Bardy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bardy 1996</LINK>). However, more expensive, biphasic waveform technology may be preferred if the results in short duration VF/VT can be replicated in people with OHCA.</P>

<P>Clinical trials of internal defibrillation and transthoracic defibrillation of short-duration arrhythmias of up to 30 seconds have demonstrated the superiority of biphasic waveforms over monophasic ones (<LINK REF="STD-Bardy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bardy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Echt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Echt 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greene-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herre 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szili_x002d_Torok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szili-Torok 2002</LINK>). Biphasic waveforms can reduce the risk of persistent VF by up to 81% compared to monophasic waveforms of the same energy (<LINK REF="REF-Faddy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faddy 2003</LINK>). However, OHCA involves a duration of VF/VT of several minutes before defibrillation is attempted. Success of defibrillation falls by as much as 7% for each minute the VF/VT goes untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1993</LINK>). Biphasic waveforms are increasingly being used for transthoracic defibrillation of people with long-duration OHCA.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-05 11:05:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the proliferation of biphasic waveform defibrillators, research that compares these waveforms to the traditional monophasic waveforms has emerged. Despite clinical trial findings that suggest biphasic defibrillation waveforms are more effective in reversing lethal arrhythmias and improving survival from OHCA, a recent retrospective case review following introduction of biphasic waveform defibrillators showed no improvement in survival rates with biphasic waveforms (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Studies of defibrillation vary widely with respect to their definition of defibrillation success. For the purpose of this Cochrane review, we defined successful defibrillation as termination of the ventricular arrhythmia with ROSC. This definition complies with the Utstein Guidelines for uniform reporting of data from people with OHCA (<LINK REF="REF-Cummins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 1991</LINK>). We contacted any trial authors who reported outcomes outside this definition, such as electrical defibrillation (termination of the arrhythmia to any rhythm including asystole), and asked them to provide their data for re-analysis.</P>
<P>Defibrillation efficacy is defined as the number of participants successfully defibrillated divided by the total number of participants in which defibrillation was attempted. The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> states that when a trial aims to reduce the incidence of an adverse outcome there is empirical evidence that RRs of the adverse outcome are more consistent than RRs of the non-event (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). For this reason, we expressed the secondary outcomes of "first shock efficacy" and "efficacy of up to three shocks" as the "failure to terminate the arrhythmia with resulting return of spontaneous circulation".</P>
<P>In the absence of substantial clinical or statistical heterogeneity, we used a fixed-effect model with RRs and 95% CIs. In the presence of statistical heterogeneity or substantial variability in primary trial populations or interventions, we considered whether to pool the trial results using a random-effects model with appropriate caution in interpretation, or not to combine trial results. We planned to perform further analyses to explore possible the sources of significant heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Our literature search identified 265 unique references of interest. We have presented the results of the study selection process in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Four trials (six articles) met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. We identified two references that referred to the same trial, and the latter reference compared the experimental waveform with two monophasic (control) waveforms separately. A follow-up paper, which compared the efficacy of the intervention using different definitions of shock success, presented the results of another included trial. Thus, we included four trials with a total of 552 participants in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-TIMBER-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TIMBER 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Designs</HEADING>
<P>All included trials were RCTs that randomised the order of biphasic and monophasic defibrillation at either the ambulance station or EMT/first-responder unit level with periods varying from one day to four months. Only one trial was double blinded (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>). One trial blinded the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) but not the trial investigator that interpreted the post-shock ECG (<LINK REF="STD-TIMBER-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TIMBER 2006</LINK>). Another included trial blinded the trial investigator but not the EMTs (<LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Populations</HEADING>
<P>All of the included trials enrolled adult participants experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). One trial compared biphasic and monophasic shocks from automated external defibrillators (AEDs) delivered by non-medical responders prior to the arrival of EMTs (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>). Typically, trials excluded participants whose cardiac arrest was witnessed by EMTs but one trial included participants who received a shock at any time during advanced life support treatment, which may have included EMT-witnessed arrests (<LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All trials included participants in the pre-hospital setting with advanced life support protocols following the ILCOR 2000 guidelines. Three trials investigated the efficacy of an escalating energy biphasic waveform. In two of these trials the first two shocks were delivered at 200 J with subsequent shocks at 360 J. In the third included trial, the energy of delivered shocks was 120 J for the first shock, 150 J for the second shock and 200 J for each shock thereafter. The fourth trial delivered fixed energy biphasic waveform at 150 J. All of the included trials employed escalating-energy 200-200-360 J monophasic waveforms in their control groups.</P>
<P>Two trials used impedence-compensating biphasic truncated exponential (BTE) waveforms, one used a standard BTE waveform and the fourth trial employed a rectilinear biphasic waveform. All trials used monophasic damped sine (MDS) waveforms as controls, and one trial also used a monophasic truncated exponential (MTE) control waveform.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The included trials reported a variety of outcome measures. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the definition of successful defibrillation that each included trial used. This Cochrane review focused on conversion of VF/VT to an organised rhythm and, where possible, we retrieved this information from the included trials.</P>
<P>All trials reported efficacy of the first defibrillation shock and two trials reported the efficacy of two and three consecutive shocks (<LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>). We recorded data on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge from all included trials.</P>
<P>No trials reported on aspects of operator safety or markers of myocardial damage. As such, we could not report these endpoints.</P>

<P>The 'Risk of bias' graph in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> shows that two of the four included trials had allocation concealment that was poorly performed or reported. However, all trials yielded a low risk of bias for randomisation, completeness of outcome reporting and equality of treatments. The 'Risk of bias' summary in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> shows that <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK> was the only included trial to yield a low risk of bias across all five categories we assessed.</P>
<P>We reported that one of the four trials was at high risk of bias regarding allocation concealment (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' section). This finding is unlikely to have affected the trial results. Even if paramedics were aware of the treatment assignment, trials enrolled consecutive participants and paramedics were unable to selectively choose to enrol or exclude a participant from the trial. Similarly, paramedics work within strict protocols and prior knowledge of the waveform in use is unlikely to lead to preferential treatment of one group or the other.</P>
<P>We consider that high risk of bias for allocation concealment does not result in high risk of bias for the included trials. Therefore, two trials were at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>), one study was at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK>) and one trial was at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-TIMBER-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TIMBER 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, blinding was adequate. Two of the four included trials, <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TIMBER-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TIMBER 2006</LINK>, blinded the defibrillator operator. In two trials, <LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>, the defibrillator operator was aware of the waveform assignment. However, as stated above, strict protocols are followed in the treatment of people with cardiac arrest and we do not believe that the lack of blinding led to significant performance bias. Three included trials used multiple outcome assessors who were blinded to the treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-ORBIT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORBIT 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK>). No trial demonstrated any aspect of care that differed between the trial groups.</P>
<P>The included trials poorly described the ITT analyses. However, there was only one defibrillator accessible at any time in three of the four included trials. Therefore, only the defibrillator that was meant to be in use was available to the crew, and minimised the possibility of crossover of treatment. In the fourth trial, <LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK>, the "carrying case of the selected AED type was tagged, clearly indicating which AED had to be used for the entire day". There was minimal loss to follow-up and all included trials reported greater than 97.5% follow-up of enrolled participants. Overall, we considered the ITT analysis acceptable in all included trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Return of spontaneous circulation</HEADING>
<P>The RR for failure to achieve ROSC after biphasic compared to monophasic waveform defibrillation was 0.86 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.20; four trials, 552 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was a moderate, though non-significant, degree of heterogeneity (P = 0.13, I statistic = 47%). This heterogeneity was entirely due to the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK>. The trial authors of <LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK> did not provide a definition of ROSC, but notably their definition of defibrillation differed from all other included trials. When we removed this trial from the analysis, there was no difference in the risk of failure to achieve ROSC (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.26) and no heterogeneity (P = 0.65, I statistic = 0%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ORCA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ORCA 2000</LINK> was the only trial that included a MTE waveform in the control arm. <LINK REF="REF-Martens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martens 2001</LINK> performed a later re-analysis of this trial and compared the biphasic waveform with each of the two monophasic waveforms used for controls. This re-analysis demonstrated identical rates of ROSC for each of the monophasic waveforms, but noted that the primary trial was powered for comparison of biphasic waveforms against all monophasic waveforms. Sensitivity analysis of the biphasic waveform against only the MDS waveform showed no changed in the study's RR, attenuation of the pooled RR and a reduction in the amount of heterogeneity in the pooled analysis.

Despite our repeated requests to the trial authors, we were unable to obtain outcome data using the definitions we had established. Inclusion of this trial in the pooled analysis generated significant statistical heterogeneity. Consequently, we presented the summary estimate of effect without data from this trial. However, although the other three trials defined defibrillation as "termination of VF to an organised rhythm", all three trials used different definitions of "organised rhythm".</P>
<P>The RR value for failure to defibrillate on the first shock following biphasic defibrillation compared to monophasic was 0.84 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; three trials, 450 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There was moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.14, I statistic = 49%). This heterogeneity was entirely due to the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-van-Alem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Alem 2003</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Regarding failure to defibrillate with up to three shocks, the RR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.09; two trials, 317 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). This trial showed no significant reduction in the risk of failure to defibrillate. There was a moderate degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (P = 0.19, I statistic = 41%).</P>
<P>Two trials (285 participants) compared the rate of ROSC after the first delivered defibrillation shock (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-02-05 08:54:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this Cochrane review we investigated whether biphasic or monophasic defibrillation waveforms are superior for transthoracic defibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The pooled results failed to demonstrate a statistically significant beneficial effect of biphasic waveforms over monophasic waveforms. In terms of failure to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), we cannot exclude a decrease in risk of 38% or an increase in risk of 20%.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in failure to defibrillate on the first shock and with up to three shocks, or survival to hospital admission or hospital discharge.</P>
<P>Although not statistically significant (P value of less than 0.1), there was a moderate degree of heterogeneity in several of our pooled analyses. This is likely due to different participant populations, slight differences in waveform characteristics and slightly different definitions of successful defibrillation between trials. We used a random-effects model for pooled analyses to account for these differences.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of publication bias other than a paucity of studies.</P>
<P>This systematic review contradicts conventional beliefs on the superiority of biphasic waveforms for transthoracic defibrillation. All of the included trials showed significant superiority of biphasic waveforms in terms of achieving ROSC. However, when expressed in terms of failure to achieve ROSC, no trial showed significant superiority. In addition, the pooled results of these trials did not have sufficient precision to demonstrate a significant benefit of biphasic waveform defibrillation.</P>
<P>This finding is supported by a more recent retrospective case review in an unselected adult OHCA population before and after the introduction of biphasic waveform defibrillators in an urban population in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2008</LINK>). Failure to achieve ROSC was the same in the biphasic and monophasic groups (70.0% vs 69.4%, P = 0.92) and there was a slightly lower (although not statistically significant) rate of hospital discharge in the biphasic group (10.3% vs 12.3%, P = 0.57).</P>
<P>Similarly, a population-based propensity-matched cohort study performed in Japan found no significant difference between patients defibrillated with biphasic compared to monophasic waveform defibrillators in terms of ROSC before hospital arrival (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; P = 0.42), one month survival (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; P = 0.39) or one month neurologically intact survival (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; P = 0.36) (<LINK REF="REF-Tanabe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanabe 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there are trends towards superiority of biphasic waveforms for first shock efficacy and efficacy of up to three (stacked) shocks, there was insufficient precision in the pooled analysis to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of failure to achieve ROSC at any time during the resuscitation effort.</P>
<P>None of the included trials investigated the potential risks to the trial participants or the rescuer associated with biphasic waveform defibrillation. We did not identify any other studies that specifically investigated adverse events. Therefore we are unable to report on the potential for adverse events from biphasic or monophasic waveform defibrillation.</P>
<P>An a priori definition of this systematic review was that lack of blinding of the defibrillator operator would not result in significant performance bias. The defibrillator operators in two of the included trials were aware of the treatment allocation. Although this should trigger a "high risk of bias" adjudication for these trials, we downgraded the risk for performance bias to "low risk" in line with our stated approach. We acknowledge that this is a value judgement which may not be shared by all readers of this Cochrane review.</P>
<P>This systematic review was subject to a number of limitations. First, we were limited to a small number of relatively small randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Second, for one included trial we were unable to obtain data in a format consistent with our study definitions for the outcome 'failure to defibrillate'. We did not include data from this trial in the pooled analyses for failure to defibrillate with the first shock and failure to defibrillate with up to three stacked shocks. Third, the small number and relatively small size of the primary studies precluded our pre-defined subgroup analyses. Last, all of the trials we included in the analysis were performed using pre-2005 resuscitation guidelines.</P>
<P>In addition, analysis of the primary outcome lacked statistical power to detect the observed level of effect. The pooled relative risk was 0.86 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.20). Power calculations show that this sample size has only 14% power to detect the observed level of effect. Hence, larger RCTs are needed to adequately explore the efficacy of biphasic compared to monophasic waveform defibrillation.</P>
<P>Funnel plots generated from the fixed-effect model of the primary outcome suggest the potential for publication bias. Although there are only a small number of included trials in our analysis, there appears to be an absence of small studies that demonstrate no effect of biphasic waveform defibrillation.</P>

<P>Although now considered standard of care, there was insufficient precision in this Cochrane review to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between monophasic waveforms for defibrillation of people with OHCA. Although this finding is unlikely to have an effect on clinical practice, it may preclude the need for more expensive technology in public access automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by negating the need for capacitors and solid-state circuitry capable of creating biphasic defibrillation pulses.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-05 08:57:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of clarity around the superiority of biphasic waveforms demonstrated in this systematic review and a recent retrospective review needs to be the focus of further research. If biphasic waveforms are to remain the clinical standard, further research to improve the efficacy is required. Research is underway investigating phase duration, waveform tilt and a number of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) factors. The relative efficacy of biphasic and monophasic waveforms should be retested under the current international resuscitation guidelines.</P>
<P>None of the studies published to date have examined quality of life or cost-benefit outcomes of biphasic or monophasic waveform defibrillators. Given the uncertainty around the superiority of biphasic waveform defibrillators, cost-effectiveness analysis is warranted to justify the added cost of biphasic waveform defibrillators.</P>
<P>Several of the outcomes in this Cochrane review were subject to moderate levels of heterogeneity. Clear guidelines should be established to define outcomes in resuscitation research so that all trials report on the same outcomes.</P>
<P>We were unable to assess the potential for adverse effects as none of the included trials provided adequate information on adverse events. Future studies should include assessment of adverse effects.</P>
