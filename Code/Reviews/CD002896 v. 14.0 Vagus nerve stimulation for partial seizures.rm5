<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:33:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where unexpected electrical discharges from the brain cause seizures. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug but sometimes seizures do not respond to drugs. Some people require more than one antiepileptic medication to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of involving the whole brain.</P>
<P>The vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is a device that is useful as an additional treatment for epilepsy that does not respond well to drugs, and only affects one part of the brain. The device is connected to the vagus nerve in the neck, and sends mild electrical impulses to it. This is particularly important for treating people whose epilepsy does not respond well to drugs and who are not eligible for epilepsy surgery, or in whom surgery was not successful in reducing frequency of seizures. The aim of this systematic review was to look at the current evidence on how effective vagus nerve stimulation is in reducing frequency of epileptic seizures and any side effects associate with using the device.</P>
<P>Overall the five multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruited a total of 439 participants and between them compared different types of VNS therapy. Overall there were three randomised controlled trials which compared high frequency stimulation to low frequency stimulation in participants aged 12-60 years and another trial examined high frequency stimulation versus low frequency stimulation in children. Additionally, one trial examined three different stimulation frequencies.</P>
<P>The review of these trials found that vagus nerve stimulation is effective, when used with one or more antiepileptic drugs, to reduce the number of seizures for people whose epilepsy does not respond to drugs alone. Common side effects were voice alteration and hoarseness, pain, shortness of breath, cough, feeling sickly, tingling sensation, headache or infection at the site of the operation, with shortness of breath, voice alteration and hoarseness more common in people receiving high frequency stimulation compared to people receiving low level stimulation.</P>
<P>Out of the five included studies, two studies were rated individually as being of high quality and the other three studies were rated as being of unclear quality due to lack of reported information in the study paper about the methods of study design. The evidence for the effectiveness and side effects of VNS therapy was limited and imprecise from the small number of studies included in this review, so was rated as being of moderate to low quality. Further large, high quality studies are required to provide more information about the effectiveness and side effects of VNS therapy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-13 14:48:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulatory treatment that is used as an adjunctive therapy for treating people with medically refractory epilepsy. VNS consists of chronic intermittent electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, delivered by a programmable pulse generator. The majority of people given a diagnosis of epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures will be controlled by treatment with a single antiepileptic drug (AED), but up to 20%-30% of patients will develop drug-resistant epilepsy, often requiring treatment with combinations of AEDs. The aim of this systematic review was to overview the current evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of vagus nerve stimulation when used as an adjunctive treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review published in Issue 7, 2010.</P>

<P>The following study designs were eligible for inclusion: randomised, double-blind, parallel or crossover studies, controlled trials of VNS as add-on treatment comparing high and low stimulation paradigms (including three different stimulation paradigms - duty cycle: rapid, mid and slow) and VNS stimulation versus no stimulation or a different intervention. Eligible participants were adults or children with drug-resistant partial seizures not eligible for surgery or who failed surgery.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-13 14:49:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) adverse effects; (d) quality of life; (e) cognition; (f) mood. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. Sensitivity best and worst case analyses were also undertaken to account for missing outcome data. Pooled Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl) were estimated for the primary outcomes of seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal. For adverse effects, pooled RRs and 99% CI's were calculated.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:33:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials recruited a total of 439 participants and between them compared different types of VNS stimulation therapy. Baseline phase ranged from 4 to 12 weeks and double-blind treatment phases from 12 to 20 weeks in the five trials. Overall, two studies were rated as having a low risk of bias and three had an unclear risk of bias due to lack of reported information around study design. Effective blinding of studies of VNS is difficult due to the frequency of stimulation-related side effects such as voice alteration; this may limit the validity of the observed treatment effects. Four trials compared high frequency stimulation to low frequency stimulation and were included in quantitative syntheses (meta-analyses).The overall risk ratio (95% CI) for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency across all studies was 1.73 (1.13 to 2.64) showing that high frequency VNS was over one and a half times more effective than low frequency VNS. For this outcome, we rated the evidence as being moderate in quality due to incomplete outcome data in one included study; however results did not vary substantially and remained statistically significant for both the best and worst case scenarios. The risk ratio (RR) for treatment withdrawal was 2.56 (0.51 to 12.71), however evidence for this outcome was rated as low quality due to imprecision of the result and incomplete outcome data in one included study. The RR of adverse effects were as follows: (a) voice alteration and hoarseness 2.17 (99% CI 1.49 to 3.17); (b) cough 1.09 (99% CI 0.74 to 1.62); (c) dyspnea 2.45 (99% CI 1.07 to 5.60); (d) pain 1.01 (99% CI 0.60 to 1.68); (e) paresthesia 0.78 (99% CI 0.39 to 1.53); (f) nausea 0.89 (99% CI 0.42 to 1.90); (g) headache 0.90 (99% CI 0.48 to 1.69); evidence of adverse effects was rated as moderate to low quality due to imprecision of the result and/or incomplete outcome data in one included study. No important heterogeneity between studies was found for any of the outcomes.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:33:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>VNS for partial seizures appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment in 439 included participants from five trials. Results of the overall efficacy analysis show that VNS stimulation using the high stimulation paradigm was significantly better than low stimulation in reducing frequency of seizures. Results for the outcome "withdrawal of allocated treatment" suggest that VNS is well tolerated as withdrawals were rare. No significant difference was found in withdrawal rates between the high and low stimulation groups, however limited information was available from the evidence included in this review so important differences between high and low stimulation cannot be excluded . Adverse effects associated with implantation and stimulation were primarily hoarseness, cough, dyspnea, pain, paresthesia, nausea and headache, with hoarseness and dyspnea more likely to occur on high stimulation than low stimulation. However, the evidence on these outcomes is limited and of moderate to low quality. Further high quality research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of VNS for drug resistant partial seizures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:42:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2010).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:41:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a condition characterized by a tendency for recurrent seizures unprovoked by any known proximate insult. Epileptiform discharges involve either a localized area of the brain resulting in a partial seizure, or the entire brain resulting in a generalized seizure. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be five to eight per 1000 population in developed countries, and in adults the most common type is partial epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 2005</LINK>). The majority of people given a diagnosis of epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures will be controlled by treatment with a single antiepileptic drug (AED). However, 20% (reported in population-based studies) to 30% (reported in clinical (non-population-based) series) will develop drug-resistant epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>), often requiring treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). These patients tend to have frequent, disabling seizures that limit their ability to work and participate in activities. Many of these patients also suffer from the chronic effects of long-term, high-dose AED polytherapy, while anxiety and depressive disorders are common in patients with epilepsy.The development of effective new therapies for the treatment of refractory seizures is therefore of considerable importance.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-13 14:49:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulatory treatment that is used as an adjunctive therapy for people with medically refractory epilepsy who are not eligible for epilepsy surgery or in whom surgery has failed. In this procedure, a pacemaker-like device - the Neuro-cybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) - is implanted under the skin of the chest. The stimulating electrodes of the NCP carry electrical signals from the generator to the left vagus nerve. By programming the device, the frequency, intensity, and duration of stimulation can be varied (the stimulation paradigm). In the initial trials, the vagus nerve was stimulated for 30 seconds, every five minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2001</LINK>). During each 30-second stimulation, the device delivered 500 microsecond pulses at 30 Hz frequency. For each individual, the intensity of the current was set at the highest that was tolerable, or to low intensity stimulation, depending on the allocated treatment group. Also, in an attempt to further abort seizures, patients could activate the device by placing a magnet over it when a seizure had occurred, or was about to occur. Participants enrolled into the initial randomised controlled trials of VNS had drug-resistant partial epilepsy, and experienced a 24% to 28% median reduction in seizure frequency over a three month treatment period (<LINK REF="REF-Selway-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selway 1987</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-13 14:50:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Left VNS is a promising, relatively new treatment for epilepsy. In 1997, VNS was approved in the United States as an adjunctive treatment for medically refractory partial-onset seizures in adults and adolescents. For some patients with partial-onset seizures, the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are intolerable; for others, no single AED or combination of anticonvulsant agents is effective. Cerebral resective surgery is an alternative to pharmacotherapy in some cases, but many patients with partial-onset seizures are not optimal candidates for intracranial surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Schachter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schachter 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of action of VNS is not fully understood, but can be reasonably assumed to involve brainstem nuclei. The nucleus of the solitary tract, the main terminus for vagal afferents, has direct or indirect projections to the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, reticular formation, and other brainstem nuclei. These nuclei have been shown to influence cerebral seizure susceptibility, hence vagal modulation of one or more of these nuclei could plausibly represent the mechanism for seizure suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Krahl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krahl 2012</LINK>). In this context, the immunomodulatory function of the vagus nerve is of particular interest. Afferent signals can activate the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway upon inflammation. Through this pathway, efferent vagus nerve fibres inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in this way reduce inflammation. In recent years, inflammation has been strongly implicated in the development of seizures and epilepsy and therefore the activation of the anti-inflammatory pathway by VNS could decrease the inflammatory response and thereby explain its clinical effects. In addition to anticonvulsive effects, VNS might have positive effects on behavior, mood and cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Vonck-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vonck 2014</LINK>).</P>

Trial characteristics are summarised below. For further information on each trial please see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Three trials compared high stimulation to low stimulation in participants aged 12-60 years (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>) and another trial examined high stimulation versus low stimulation in children (<LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK>). One trial examined three different stimulation paradigms (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>). In the majority of the trials, participants were eligible to take part in the double-blind phase if they were found to experience a minimum of six partial seizures per month and were drug-resistant.</P>
<P>One multi-centre (USA) parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>) randomised 64 subjects &gt; 12 years of age to one of three treatment arms, corresponding to rapid, medium, and slow duty-cycles: group A, seven seconds on and 18 seconds off (n = 19); group B, 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off (n = 19); group C, 30 seconds on and three minutes off (n = 23). The baseline period was four weeks in duration with a treatment period of three months.</P>
<P>Another multi-centre (USA) parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>) included 198 subjects aged 13-60 years and had two treatment arms: intervention, high stimulation (n = 95) and active control group, low stimulation (n = 103). This trial had a baseline period of 12-16 weeks and a treatment period of 16 weeks. Dodrill 2000 and Amar 1998 are linked to this study.</P>
<P>A recent multi-centre (Holland) parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK>) investigated children only and consisted of two treatment arms including high stimulation (n = 21) and low stimulation (n = 20). The baseline period was 12 weeks in duration followed by a treatment period of 20 weeks. After the blinded phase all participants underwent a non-controlled follow-up, in which they received high stimulation (add-on phase). Aalbers 2012 is linked to this study.</P>
<P>One multi-centre (USA and Europe) parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>) had a pre-randomisation period of 12 weeks and a treatment period of 14 weeks, where 22 adults were randomised to one of two treatment arms: high, therapeutic (n = 10) or low, sub-therapeutic (n = 12). All patients completed the acute phase of the study and entered the extension phase.</P>
<P>A further multi-centre (USA, Sweden and Germany) parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>) randomised 114 patients to one of two treatment arms: high-level stimulation (n = 54) and low-level stimulation (n = 60). This trial had a baseline period of 12 weeks and a treatment period of 14 weeks. Patients exiting the study were offered indefinite extension treatment in an open trial.

<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>). As for the domain of sequence generation, we rated four studies (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>) as having a low risk of bias due to using a computer-generated randomisation schedule or random number tables/random permuted blocks. We rated one study (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>) as unclear due to a lack of details on the methods used.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK> study, randomisation occurred in blocks of six (two for each group), with a unique predetermined randomisation schedule for each site. In the <LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK> trial, randomisation schedule was generated by a statistical consultant. A consultant organisation served as central randomiser using this schedule. Randomisation for each study site was in groups of four participants. In order to randomise an individual, the unblinded programmer at that site telephoned the randomiser to obtain the randomised treatment assignment. The blinded interviewer at each site had no access to the randomiser, nor to the treatment assignment list, which was kept in a locked place by the site programmer. In <LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK> participants were allocated to a treatment condition by one trial nurse using a computer program. Finally, in the <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK> report, randomisation tables were developed by an independent statistician. Assignments were made by a look-up table in the software used to program the generator. Participants were randomised in blocks of four at each site. The investigators and sponsor were unaware of the assignments prior to randomisation.</P>

An important issue in blinded trials on VNS is the difficulty of effectively blinding the patients given the frequency of stimulation-related side effects such as voice alteration. This could limit the validity of the observed treatment effects.</P>

<P>Data from two studies are reported narratively; the Dodrill 2000 paper as part of <LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK> and the Holder 1992 paper as part of <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK> contributed to this outcome.</P>
<P>On the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31), there was no statistically significant differences of interaction effects between high versus low VNS frequency. On the Short Form (36) Health Survey<B> (</B>SF-36), there was a statistically significant difference between groups on the domains of Physical Function and Social Function, but no difference for all other domains. There were no statistically significant differences between groups on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) and Health-Related Hardiness Scale (H-RHS). On the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI), only financial status was reported to be significantly different between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>, Quality of Life was evaluated according to 'patient,' 'investigator' and 'companion' Global Rating Scales; an evaluation of the patient's condition at each follow up visit compared to baseline measured on a Visual Analogue Scale. Quality of life was significantly improved compared to baseline according to all three Global Rating Scales (patient, investigator and companion) in both the high stimulation and low stimulation groups compared to the low stimulation group (p&lt;0.001 for both groups for all three scales), but no significant difference between stimulation groups was observed in Quality of Life. </P>
<P>In addition, results from these two studies showed that the patients who had at least 50% seizure reduction exhibited signs of slight improvement in QOL variables compared to those patients who did not demonstrate this degree of seizure reduction. Overall, a small number of favourable QOL effects were associated with levels of VNS stimulation that are now typically used clinically.</P>

<P>Data from one study (Dodrill 2000 paper as part of <LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>) contributed to this outcome.

</P>
<P>Data from one study (Elger 2000 paper as part of <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>) contributed to this outcome. Mood was measured according to the Montgomery&#8211;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline 3 months and 6 months. A MADRS Total score of between 10 and 20 (maximum score 20) indicated mild depressive mood disorder. At baseline, three out of five patients in the low stimulation group and four out of six patients in the high stimulation group had MADRS scores greater than 10, at three months, two out of five patients in the low stimulation group and two out of six patients in the high stimulation group had MADRS scores greater than 10 and at six months, one out of five patients in the low stimulation group and one out of six patients in the high stimulation group had MADRS scores greater than 10. Overall, four out of five patients in the low stimulation group and five out of six patients in the high stimulation group showed decreases in MADRS scores over the study, but no statistically difference in was present between high and low stimulation groups (Mann-Whitney's test; P &lt; 0.10).</P>

<P>Data from just one study (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>) contributed to this comparison.

For all three groups combined, the reduction in seizure frequency was 40%. Between group comparisons revealed no statistically significant differences in seizure frequency (Kruskal Wallis test, p value is not reported).

<P>Throughout the study period only three patients withdrew and the reasons for this were: one developed a device infection, one was lost to follow-up, and one could not tolerate stimulation (rapid cycle).

Cough and voice alteration were more common among rapid cycle stimulation (26%, versus 5% medium cycle and 9% for slow cycle). Other adverse effects were not sub-divided into treatment groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-10 12:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five randomised controlled trials which recruited 439 participants were included in this review. All trials were sponsored by Cyberonics, Inc., Webster, TX, USA. In four trials, participants were randomised to high or low VNS and in the remaining trial participants were randomised to duty cycles of rapid, mild or slow VNS.</P>
<P>Results of the overall efficacy analysis show that people receiving high VNS stimulation were 1.73 (95% Cl 1.13 to 2.64) times more likely to have reduced seizures compared to those receiving low stimulation. This effect did not vary substantially and remained statistically significant for both the best and worst case scenarios, accounting for missing outcome data in one study. Results from one study contributed to the comparison of three different duty cycles paradigms (rapid versus mild versus slow), showing no statistically significant differences in seizure frequency. All included studies were of short duration, so no conclusions can be drawn about long term efficacy of VNS.</P>
<P>Results for treatment withdrawal rates of high and low stimulation groups were similar; there was little difference between the numbers of people who dropped out of the high stimulation group (n = 5) compared to the low stimulation group (n = 2). However, due to imprecision of the pooled result (RR 2.56 [95% Cl 0.51 to 12.71]), important differences in withdrawal rates between the stimulation paradigms cannot be ruled out based on current evidence. The most common adverse events were voice alteration and hoarseness, cough, dyspnea, pain, paresthesias, nausea, and headache. For these adverse effects, voice alteration/hoarseness and dyspnea were over twice as likely to occur in people receiving high stimulation. However, there is some uncertainty and imprecision in reported differences in adverse events between groups; there are often wide confidence intervals, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Only three out of sixty-four subjects exited early in the study comparing rapid versus mild versus slow stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>): one developed a device infection, requiring removal, one could not tolerate stimulation (high stimulation group), and one was lost to follow-up. This total percentage withdrawal rate of 4.7% suggests that the treatment is well tolerated.</P>
<P>Results from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>)contributed to QOL outcome and showed that a small number of favourable QOL effects were associated with VNS stimulation, but no statistically significant differences between high and low level stimulation groups. Data from one study contributed to cognition outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>); no statistically significant differences were reported between high versus low frequency VNS on all four measures used. Data from one study contributed to mood outcome (<LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>); the majority of patients showed an improvement in mood on the MADRS scale compared to baseline but no statistically significant differences were reported between high versus low frequency VNS.</P>

<P>Currently there are only five studies which look at VNS for partial seizures, with less than 500 participants in total. The addition of further evidence from future studies may change the results and conclusions of this review.</P>
<P>This review focuses on the use of VNS in drug-resistant partial seizures. The results cannot be extrapolated to other patient groups like those with generalised epilepsy. The results of this review indicate that VNS is an effective add-on treatment for drug-resistant seizures, but we cannot state how VNS compares to other antiepileptic treatments. This is especially true for VNS because it was tested in an active control situation whereas antiepileptic drugs are tested against placebo. Head-to-head trials are needed to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic treatments.</P>

<P>Out of the five included studies, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>) were rated individually as having a low risk of bias and the other three studies were rated as having an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>), due to lack of methodological detail concerning study design. The GRADE approach was employed to rate the level of evidence per outcome and this is presented in a summary of findings table (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). For the main outcome of 50% reduction in seizure frequency, the quality of evidence was rated as moderate due to incomplete outcome data from one study contributing to the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>), however results of best case and worst case scenario analysis to account for missing outcome data showed similar results (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>). Tolerability outcomes (withdrawal and adverse effects) were judged as moderate to low quality due to the imprecision of pooled results and incomplete outcome data from one study contributing to the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In three trials, adequate methods of allocation concealment and randomisation were described (<LINK REF="STD-Handforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Handforth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klinkenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klinkenberg 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK>). In two papers, no details on the methods of blinding of participants and outcome assessors were reported (<LINK REF="STD-DeGiorgio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DeGiorgio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 1993</LINK>). The issue of blinding in these studies is somewhat more complex than in typical randomised controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs where a placebo tablet can be administered. The different stimulation paradigms raise the possibility that investigators and participants may not have been adequately blinded to the treatment groups because individuals in the control group may been able to detect that the stimulations were very infrequent; this is likely to be an issue in all trials involving a VNS device.</P>
<P>All protocols for the trials were requested from authors, but no protocols were provided to assist in fully assessing the risk of selective outcome reporting, so this remains unclear in most included studies.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-13 14:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review were essentially active control trials, thus results may be difficult to compare against other meta-analyses of antiepileptic drugs that were compared against placebo. The magnitude of the risk ratio for high VNS treatment compared to control would tend to be reduced by any anti-seizure effect of the low stimulation. A higher risk ratio may have been found if high VNS treatment was compared against no stimulation, but the investigators decided that with a low level of stimulation that was thought to be ineffective, participants were less likely to guess which treatment they were receiving.</P>
<P>Another recent review on VNS (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2013</LINK>) supports the conclusions made in this review with regard to a positive outcome through use of VNS. This review also describes an association between VNS and mood in adult patients, and includes children-specific analyses.</P>

<P>VNS appears to be an effective treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, as an add-on treatment. Results of the overall efficacy analysis show that VNS stimulation using the high stimulation paradigm was significantly better than low stimulation in reducing seizure frequency by 50%. High and low stimulation VNS are both well tolerated and withdrawals are rare, however limited information regarding withdrawal from treatment was available from the evidence included in this review so important differences between high and low stimulation cannot be excluded. Adverse effects associated with implantation and stimulation were primarily hoarseness, cough, dyspnea, pain, paresthesia, nausea and headache, with voice alteration and dyspnea more likely to occur on high level stimulation than low level stimulation according to current evidence. The adverse effect profile was substantially different from the adverse effect profile associated with antiepileptic drugs, making VNS a potential alternative for patients with difficulty tolerating antiepileptic drug adverse effects.</P>

<P>Identifying the adverse effect profile of VNS was rather complex because treatment involves both implantation of the device and intermittent stimulation, each with slightly different adverse effects. In addition, these studies were essentially active control trials.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The following comment was made on 21 May 2006 regarding Analysis 01.01. Comparison 01 High stimulation versus low stimulation, Outcome 01 50% responders.<BR/>The two groups in the VNS Study Group consists of 54 people and 60 people and NOT 2 x 57 people. This mistake is shown in many of the analyses.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2015-01-13 15:05:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst there may be a discrepancy between the data presented in this review and the original published report by the VNS Study Group, the authors have not made a mistake in the preparation of this review.</P>
<P>In the VNS study group trial, 57 patients were randomized to high stimulation and 57 were randomized to low stimulation. However, three patients allocated to high stimulation had their stimulator programmed for low stimulation in error. For the paper published in Neurology, these three patients were analysed in the low stimulation group rather than in the group to which they had been allocated. The authors of this Cochrane review preferred to use themore conservative intention to treat analysis in which patients are analysed in the treatment group which they were allocated.</P>
<P>Reply made by Dr Tony Marson (Co-ordinating Editor - Cochrane Epilepsy Group) on behalf of the review authors (06 August 2008).</P>
<P>Update 2014: Following re-review of the data extracted from the VNS study Group manuscripts, the majority of the data used in the analyses in this review is presented for the High Stimulation Group of 54 people and the Low Stimulation Group of 60 people; in other words, groups according to the treatment received rather than treatment allocated. In the analysis of the previous version of the review, the event rates reported for the groups of 54 and 60 patients respectively were used in analysis but with group totals assigned as 57 participants per group as an intention to treat analysis. </P>
<P>However, following consideration for this update, given that separate data for the three participants randomised to high stimulation but received low stimulation is not presented, assuming event rates in the treatment received groups would be in same as in the treatment allocated groups may not necessarily be correct. For this reason, the authors of the updated review have presented results in terms of the treatment received groups. They acknowledge that this is not an intention to treat approach and have reflected this in the risk of bias table for the <LINK REF="STD-VNS-Study-Group-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VNS Study Group 1995</LINK> study.</P>
