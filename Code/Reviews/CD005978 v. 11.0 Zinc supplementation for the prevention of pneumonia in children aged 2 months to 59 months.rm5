<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We evaluated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation to prevent pneumonia in children aged from two to 59 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Zinc is an essential element for children's growth and development. Too little zinc is associated with increased risk of infection, particularly diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children are more prone to zinc deficiency because they are less able to absorb dietary zinc and some children, especially in low-income countries, may not have received enough zinc from their mothers before birth. Zinc supplements for children has been reported to prevent pneumonia.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to October 2016. This is an update of a review published in 2010. We did not find any new studies for this update.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included six studies that investigated zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Peru and South Africa and involved 5193 children aged from two to 59 months. Children received either zinc or a similar-looking treatment that did not contain zinc. In two studies, children were also given vitamin A.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>All included studies were funded. Of these, three explicitly mentioned that funding agencies had no role in the design and results of the study.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Zinc supplementation was significantly associated with reducing the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia among children aged from two to 59 months. On subgroup analysis, we found that a more stringent diagnosis (radiological examination) increased the reduction in pneumonia incidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, evidence quality was assessed as low on GRADE assessment.</P>

<P>We did not identify any new studies for inclusion in this update. We included six studies that involved 5193 participants.</P>
<P>Analysis showed that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 13% (fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.94, six studies, low-quality evidence) and prevalence of pneumonia by 41% (random-effects RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, one study, n = 609, low-quality evidence). On subgroup analysis, we found that zinc reduced the incidence of pneumonia defined by specific clinical criteria by 21% (i.e. confirmation by chest examination or chest radiograph) (fixed-effect RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, four studies, n = 3261), but had no effect on lower specificity pneumonia case definition (i.e. age-specific fast breathing with or without lower chest indrawing) (fixed-effect RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, four studies, n = 1932).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-30 13:24:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-30 13:24:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Pneumonia is the largest cause of childhood mortality, accounting for 15% of all childhood deaths under five years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>), and 19% of all childhood deaths in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2008</LINK>). Pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>) in children aged under five years. Presenting features in viral or bacterial pneumonia are similar, however wheezing is more common in children with viral pneumonia.</P>
<P>Pneumonia can be prevented by immunising against <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type B (Hib), pneumococcus, measles and pertussis (whooping cough) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Nutrition including breastfeeding for the first six months of life plays a major role by boosting immunity against causative organisms of pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Good hygiene and clean indoor air also help in preventing pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2013</LINK> identified five risk factors for pneumonia: malnutrition, low birth weight, nonexclusive breast feeding, solid fuel use and overcrowding. By 2010, pneumonia episodes for children aged under four years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) decreased by 25% over the past decade to about 0.22 episodes per child per year when exposure to the five risk factors decreased by 20% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2013</LINK>). Therefore, any interventions that can improve child survival from pneumonia are important.</P>
<P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), zinc deficiency accounts for 13% of all lower respiratory tract infection (LRTIs) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Acute LRTI is a leading cause of mortality among children aged under five years (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2008</LINK>), and which is responsible for nearly two million deaths annually, mainly in low-income countries.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-30 13:24:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>In 2005, zinc intake was inadequate among 17.3% of the world's population; rates of zinc adequacy are lower in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Wessells-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessells 2012</LINK>). The World Bank described multiple factors such as low animal food intake, less bioavailability of dietary zinc, and zinc loss during events of diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Black-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1998</LINK>) that could potentially lead to zinc deficiency in low-income settings (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2016</LINK>). The WHO estimated that zinc deficiency may be related to 800,000 deaths a year, with more than 50% occurring in children under five years of age. Children are more susceptible to zinc deficiency because of lower rates of intestinal absorption and from starting life with low body stores due to intrapartum under-nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mild-to-moderate zinc deficiency is associated with impaired physical growth, delayed sexual maturity, behavioural disturbances, anorexia, affected permeability of the intestinal tract and decreased immunocompetence as well as subclinical inflammation; moderate-to-severe deficiency can lead to diarrhoea; and severe deficiency produces dermatitis and alopecia (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence that preventative zinc supplementation reduces pneumonia morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yakoob-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yakoob 2011</LINK>) and is beneficial in reducing diarrhoeal episodes in children with acute and persistent diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zinc-Group-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinc Group 2000</LINK>). However, there is insufficient evidence to support preventive zinc supplementation or adjunctive zinc supplementation with antibiotics to reduce pneumonia-specific mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yakoob-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yakoob 2011</LINK>). Zinc supplements (zinc sulphate, zinc gluconate, zinc acetate) can be administered as tablets, syrup or powder. However, zinc supplements need to be administered with caution because excess levels may cause toxicity.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-09 15:39:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>Zinc plays an important role in cell regeneration, immunity and growth (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shankar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankar 1998</LINK>). Zinc deficiency decreases T-lymphocytes and T-helper, impairs macrophage function and reduced killer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Ibs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravaglia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravaglia 2000</LINK>), and adversely impacts innate immunity affecting interferon (IFN) gamma production, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumour necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>). Zinc supplementation in children increases levels of complement in the blood that modulate the function of T-lymphocytes, T-helper, macrophages and neutrophils and hence improves the ability to fight infection. Zinc supplementation improves circulating levels of T-lymphocytes and other macrophages that enhance ability to fight infection (<LINK REF="REF-Fraker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraker 1993</LINK>). Zinc is not stored in the body, but repletion is straightforward. Children with diarrhoea can become zinc deficient quickly. Furthermore, if zinc deficiency occurs during periods of growth, it can be conducive to growth faltering as is shown by a review that found correlation between dietary zinc inadequacy and stunting among children aged under four years (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wessells-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessells 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK> showed that zinc was associated with a reduced incidence of pneumonia. <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2007</LINK> included more recent studies, but included children aged between birth and 59 months who were given zinc supplements for at least a few months. <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2010</LINK> calculated the effect size by case definition of pneumonia, and included studies that administered zinc supplements to children aged between birth and 59 months. <LINK REF="REF-Yakoob-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yakoob 2011</LINK> focused on zinc supplementation for more than three months in children aged under five years and found evidence to support the positive impact of zinc supplementation on diarrhoeal and pneumonia morbidity and mortality to include it in the LiST tool. However <LINK REF="REF-Yakoob-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yakoob 2011</LINK> did not include low birth weight or small-for-gestational age infants, nor provide a specific case definition for pneumonia. Similarly, a review by <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2013</LINK> of diarrhoea and pneumonia interventions reported a non-significant impact of preventive zinc supplementation on acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI)-related mortality.</P>
<P>We investigated zinc supplementation for at least three months in children aged from two months to 59 months and conducted a meta-analysis of data published up to 2011. However, with new and upcoming trials, this review required updating.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library (<A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">www.thecochranelibrary.com</A>, accessed 21 October 2016), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (November 2009 to 21 October 2016) and Embase (January 2010 to 21 October 2016). We searched LILACS (1982 to 21 October 2016) using a new search strategy. We also searched CINAHL (1981 to 21 October 2016) and Web of Science (1985 to 21 October 2016).

<P>We used the search strategy described in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>) . We adapted the search strategy to search Embase (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), LILACS (Virtual Health Library) (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>), CINAHL (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>) and Web of Science (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>).

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Initially, we used fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis to combine data where trials examined the same intervention, and study populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where we suspected clinical or methodological heterogeneity between studies sufficient to suggest that treatment effects may differ between trials, we conducted random-effects meta-analysis.

<P>We measured heterogeneity among the trials by calculating the I² statistic, and Chi² P value. If the I² statistic exceeded 50%, and the Chi² P value was less than 0.1, we would have considered heterogeneity to be substantial. We did not find any heterogeneity; therefore, we did not attempt subgroup analyses based on differences in zinc dosage, participants' age, supplementation in healthy children compared with children recovering from an episode of illness, and pre-intervention zinc levels. However, we attempted to look for the differential effect of zinc supplementation on the case definition of ALRI.</P>

Children were randomised to receive zinc alone, zinc plus vitamins or placebo for two weeks. Childrens' characteristics at baseline were similar except for sex and length-for-age Z scores.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brooks-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks 2005</LINK> conducted a study in a low-income population in an urban setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study included 1665 children aged from 60 days to 12 months who were randomly allocated to receive oral zinc (70 mg) or placebo once weekly. Children were assessed weekly in the children's homes. Children with suggestive respiratory disease or diarrhoea were referred to clinics where they were assessed and diagnoses made based on the WHO criteria.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bhandari 2002</LINK> included 2482 children aged six to 30 months who were from urban slums in New Delhi, India. Children received daily elemental zinc (10 mg for infants; 20 mg for older children) or placebo for four months. Both groups received single dose vitamin A (100,000 IU for infants and 200,000 IU for older children) at enrolment.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:47:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and included no new studies. Previous conclusions are unchanged.</P>
<P>We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of zinc supplementation in children aged from two to 59 months. Our meta-analysis indicated that zinc supplementation led to reductions in the incidence of pneumonia by 13% and pneumonia prevalence by 41%. The greater overall reduction of pneumonia prevalence result is due to prevalence data originating from one study.</P>
<P>We found that zinc reduced pneumonia incidence (defined by specific clinical criteria and confirmed by chest examination or chest radiograph) by 21%. We found an expected association of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) case definition with an effect size (P = 0.02). We found benefits of zinc supplementation when ALRI was diagnosed following clinical examination or chest radiography suggesting infection.</P>
<P>Reduction in pneumonia incidence supports the use of zinc supplements among children two to 59 months of age. Because zinc is not stored in the body, adequate zinc needs to be available in daily diet (<LINK REF="REF-Sanstead-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanstead 1995</LINK>). Children, particularly those from low-income countries who have inadequate intake of food that contains zinc (mainly foods of animal origin) should receive supplements to address deficiency.</P>

The use of consistent and accurate definitions of pneumonia, with emphasis on clinical documentation of key signs or radiographic diagnosis, would avoid misclassification and lead to greater confidence in study findings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:47:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed that review outcomes were low according to GRADE criteria. We downgraded evidence quality because outcomes were ascertained using different criteria and 'Risk of bias' assessment. Of note, half of the included studies reported pneumonia according to the WHO definition (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>); the remainder relied on clinical examination and chest radiographs. We therefore looked for differential effects on outcome estimates with respect to case definition and reported their impact separately.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequately described overall. All included studies were deemed to be adequately blinded for treatment assignment. Completion rates were greater than 90% in four included studies; <LINK REF="STD-Penny-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Penny 2004</LINK> reported completion by 16% of participants and <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK> did not report numbers of participants who dropped out. The low levels of missing data meant that we chose not to assess the impact on overall estimates because it was not anticipated to cause significant bias in the study results.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:52:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We undertook a systematic search of the literature to identify all studies that met our inclusion criteria. Study selection and data extraction decisions were cross-checked independently by the review authors. Included studies were not free from bias; only one study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains. We could not assess reporting bias because of the limited numbers of included studies.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:49:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found RCT evidence from both high- and low-income countries showing an effect of zinc in decreasing morbidity and mortality in children due to respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hambidge-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hambidge 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK>). The effect of zinc against infectious diseases is therapeutic as well as preventive.</P>
<P>Findings reported by the Zinc Investigators&#8217; Collaborative Group in (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2007</LINK> were consistent with our review. <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK> reported that children who received zinc supplements had positive effects for pneumonia (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.83). Moreover, <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1999</LINK> included trials that administered zinc supplements with therapeutic intent, which might have led to an overestimation of the potential preventive effects of zinc. <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2007</LINK> included trials that recruited children aged from birth to 59 months who were provided zinc supplementation for at least three months; analysis showed 20% decreased incidence of respiratory illness among children supplemented with zinc compared with placebo. Similar findings were reported by <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2010</LINK> who also assessed specific case definitions for impact evaluation of children aged from birth to five years. <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2010</LINK> reported that zinc reduced ALRI incidence defined by specific clinical criteria (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), compared with no effect on lower-specificity ALRI case definitions based on caregiver reports (IRR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12) or WHO non-severe pneumonia (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.08).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:49:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found sufficient evidence to support the use of zinc supplementation for children aged from two to 59 months to prevent pneumonia. Our analysis supports use of preventive zinc supplementation to improve child health.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-23 20:49:43 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to establish the benefit of zinc supplementation for preventing pneumonia among children aged from two to 59 months. Development of effective and feasible interventions to improve zinc status in children is essential. Enhancement of bioavailable zinc in foods by genetic engineering, plant breeding and periodical supplementation are other possible intervention strategies that should be evaluated.</P>
<P>Given the rising burden of child mortality due to respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia, and considering its decreasing impact with zinc supplementation, further reviews should be considered in which the effectiveness of zinc supplementation should be assessed for acute pneumonia provided that cases are well-defined by strict clinical criteria.</P>

<P>RCT in which the children were individually randomised by a computer-generated simple randomisation scheme in blocks of 8. Zinc or placebo bottles were labelled with a unique child identification number according to the randomisation scheme. Six bottles, one for each month and two extra, for each child were produced and labelled before enrolment commenced. The supplies for each child were kept separately in labelled plastic bags. The zinc and placebo syrups were similar in appearance, taste, and packaging. Blinding was maintained during analyses by coding the groups as A or B.</P>
<P>The study took place in the urban slum of Dakshinpuri in New Delhi, India. For episodes to be counted as individual, there had to be at least 14 intervening days. The children in the two groups were comparable for age, anthropometry, child feeding practices, morbidity in the previous 24 hours, socioeconomic characteristics and plasma zinc concentration.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-11-22 22:36:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The study included children aged from 6 to 30 months. There were 1241 children in each group, and after dropouts, the number reduced to 1093 in the zinc and 1133 in the placebo groups. Children were excluded if consent was refused, were likely to move out of the study area within the next four months, needed urgent admission to hospital on the enrolment day or had received a massive dose of vitamin A (100,000 IU for infants and 200,000 IU for older children) within the two months before enrolment.<BR/>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-23 03:13:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Doses of elemental zinc were 10 mg for infants and 20 mg for older children (twice the recommended daily dosage) as zinc gluconate. Zinc or placebo was taken daily for four months. Both groups received single massive doses of vitamin A (100,000 IU for infants and 200,000 IU for older children) at enrolment. Immunisations and treatment for acute illnesses were provided as per WHO guidelines. Children with acute lower respiratory tract infections received co­trimoxazole. Amoxicillin was substituted if the child did not respond within three days. Children were sent to hospital if they had signs and symptoms that warranted referral according to WHO guidelines.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-11-22 22:38:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Incidence of ALRI</P>
<P>ALRIs were defined by cough and fast breathing or lower chest indrawing as assessed by the physician; other clinical signs were not taken into account. Fast breathing was defined as 2 counts of &gt; 50 breaths/minute for infants and &gt; 40 breaths/minute for older children.</P>
<P>Pneumonia was diagnosed either by a combination of cough with crepitations or bronchial breathing by auscultation or as an episode of ALRI associated with at least one of lower chest indrawing, convulsions, not able to drink or feed, extreme lethargy, restlessness or irritability, nasal flaring, or abnormal sleepiness.</P>

Children with pneumonia were treated with co-trimoxazole (10 mg/kg trimethoprim, twice daily for 5 days) for pneumonia. Children on antibiotics were assessed within 72 hours of starting treatment; those who did not improve (i.e. the respiratory rate did not change by more than 5 breaths/minute from baseline) were switched to treatment with amoxicillin (40 mg/kg, three times daily for 5 days). If oral treatment failed, or if they had severe pneumonia, children were referred to hospital for parenteral treatment (ceftriaxone 75 mg/kg intramuscularly per day).

<P>412 children aged 6 to 36 months with diarrhoea for 14 days were randomly assigned, after being stratified for breastfeeding status, to receive two weeks of daily supplementation with one of three indistinguishable supplements: placebo; 20 mg zinc daily as zinc gluconate (zinc group); or 20 mg zinc daily as zinc gluconate plus a mixture of other micronutrients, i.e. vitamins and minerals (zinc VM group). A subset of children consisting of the first 246 children enrolled who intended to remain in the study area subsequently received the same assigned supplement at one-half the initial daily dose (10 mg zinc daily) and continued under observation for a total of 6 months.</P>

<P>Supplements were supplied as individual doses of a dry micronutrient mixture with added sugar, colouring and flavouring agents, which were dissolved in clean water in participants&#8217; homes and provided as a liquid beverage under the supervision of study personnel on Monday through Friday and by parents or other caregivers during the weekends. There were two intervention arms, zinc plus vitamins and minerals who were given 10 mg of zinc supplementation along with different combinations of mineral and vitamins. Another interventional arm was given zinc 10 mg and the control group was not given any supplementation.</P>

<P>In this review, groups with zinc and placebo are included for analysis. Examination included assessment of hydration status, measurement of rectal temperature and monitoring of respiratory rate, which was counted for 1 minute and repeated if the rate was greater than age-specific upper limits (50/minute for children aged 6 to 11 months and 40/minute for children aged 11 months). Children were referred to the study physician for diagnosis and treatment when the fieldworker or caregiver was concerned about the child&#8217;s health status or if the child had any one of several predefined signs of illness, including fever, presentation or worsening of cough with elevated respiratory rate (i.e. fieldworker-defined acute lower respiratory infection), persistent diarrhoea, diarrhoea with signs of dehydration, or vomiting or skin conditions requiring diagnosis.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-11-23 02:41:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Please note the following feedback. </P>
<P>1. The forest plot in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> shows that participants in the trial by Bhandari et al, have been split to present two different outcomes. Half the participants in each arm are included for the outcome "Diagnosis based on age-specific fast breathing with or without lower chest indrawing" and half for the outcome "Diagnosis based age-specific fast breathing AND confirmed by chest examination or chest radiograph". Both outcomes have been presented as subgroup analysis in the same forest plot; although the trial report mentions that both outcomes were evaluated in all participants. Please confirm whether the procedure adopted in this review is standard practice; and the purpose of doing this.</P>
<P>
<B>Answer: </B>We presented the findings after dividing the participants equally in the four cells so that participants do not repeat across analysis. The number of participants were 1241 in each group and we divided them as 620/621 for each of the four cells).</P>
<P>2. A similar adjustment seems to have been made with the participants in the trial by Sazawal et al.</P>
<P>
<B>Answer</B>: Adjusted</P>
<P>3. The reference section mentions three citations under <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK>a; and one under <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK>b. The third citation in <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK>a is the same as <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 1998</LINK>b. Further, none of the citations reports 3300 participants in the trial; whereas this is the number included in the meta-analysis. Sazawal's 1995 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine mentions 937 participants; while the 1998 publication in Pediatrics reported 609 participants. Please confirm the basis for using the numbers in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> Those were the two parts of the same study. We have now merged it and presented it as one study.</P>
<P>4. The meta-analysis has pooled data from children with HIV infection, along with otherwise healthy children. While it seems reasonable to pool children with unknown HIV status with otherwise healthy children, it would be better to analyse HIV infected children separately since pneumonia in immuno-compromised children could be quite different from otherwise healthy children.</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> In the text only, we presented the results on removing Bobat trial as well.</P>
<P>Submitter agrees with default conflict of interest statement:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-07 11:50:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, issue 2), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to January Week 2, 2010), Embase (1974 to January 2010) and LILACS (1985 to January 2010).</P>
<P>We used the following search strategy to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. The search strategy incorporates the search strategy devised by <LINK REF="REF-Boluyt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boluyt 2008</LINK> to identify child studies. Due to the small number of search results we chose not to use a search filter to identify randomised trials. We adapted the search strategy to search Embase (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and LILACS (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
