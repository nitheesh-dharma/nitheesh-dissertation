<P>Summary of most important changes in the update:</P>
<P>The search for eligible studies was updated to December 2015.</P>
<P>We identified long-term follow-up data of one of the earlier included RCTs on different infusion durations in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: with a longer follow-up none of the assessed outcomes changed. However, more data on the risk of bias became available, changing the risk of performance bias from unclear to high.</P>
<P>For the 'Risk of bias' assessment we used the most recent recommendations of the Cochrane Childhood Cancer, which are based on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. All publications (including those already included in earlier versions of the review) were scored using the new 'Risk of bias' criteria.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-23 10:02:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence of different anthracycline dosage schedules to cause damage to the heart in people with cancer of all ages receiving anthracycline chemotherapy. We also looked at tumour response, participant survival, adverse effects other than damage to the heart, and quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Anthracyclines are one of the most effective treatments for various types of cancer. Unfortunately, there is a risk of heart damage depending on the total dose a patient has received. In an effort to prevent heart damage, different anthracycline dosage schedules such as different infusion durations or different individual peak doses (the maximal dose received in one week) are being used.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to December 2015.</P>
<P>We found 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion durations (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak doses (5280 participants). Participants had different types of cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>For the use of different anthracycline infusion durations, the authors found that an anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure (for example shortness of breath or leg oedema), and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical heart failure (that is heart damage diagnosed for example by an echocardiography in people without symptoms). Only a small amount of data was available for children and individuals with leukaemia, since most studies evaluating different anthracycline infusion durations were performed in adults with solid tumours.</P>
<P>Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to favour either a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more. There was not enough high-quality evidence available for the use of other anthracycline peak doses to be able to draw conclusions. No data were available for children and individuals with leukaemia.</P>
<P>Further high-quality research is needed.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All studies had problems relating to quality of the evidence.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-24 10:59:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion durations (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak doses (5280 participants). Seven studies were RCTs addressing different anthracycline infusion durations; we identified long-term follow-up data for one of the trials in this update. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 participants). The majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. For different anthracycline peak doses, we identified two RCTs addressing a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>versus 60 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>or more, one RCT addressing a liposomal doxorubicin peak dose of 25 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>versus 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and one RCT addressing an epirubicin peak dose of 83 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> versus 110 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. A significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure was identified in none of the studies. The participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. High or unclear 'Risk of bias' issues were present in all studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-23 09:42:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>An anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. Since there is only a small amount of data for children and data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children.</P>
<P>We identified no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in participants treated with a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more. Only one RCT was available for the other identified peak doses, so we can make no definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. More high-quality research is needed, both in children and adults and in leukaemias and solid tumours.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-29 12:37:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-24 10:57:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anthracyclines are among the most effective drugs used in chemotherapy for people with cancer and are widely used to treat both solid tumours and leukaemia in both adults and children. However, their use is limited because they often cause damage to the heart, especially if given high doses (<LINK REF="REF-Bonadonna-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonadonna 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefrak-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefrak 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Pal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Pal 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heart damage after anthracycline therapy can be divided into early and late cardiotoxicity according to the time of presentation: early cardiotoxicity refers to heart damage that develops during anthracycline therapy or in the first year after its completion, and late cardiotoxicity manifests itself at least one year after the completion of anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 1996</LINK>). The risk of developing heart failure remains a lifelong threat, especially for children and young adults, who have a long life expectancy after successful treatment for cancer. The risk of developing clinical heart failure 20 years after anthracycline therapy for childhood cancer is estimated to be approximately 5.5%, and 9.8% if treated with doses of 300 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heart damage can occur as either subclinical cardiotoxicity or clinical cardiotoxicity. The term subclinical cardiotoxicity is used to describe various cardiac abnormalities, diagnosed with different diagnostic methods in patients without symptoms. Examples are histological abnormalities according to the Billingham score (<LINK REF="REF-Billingham-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billingham 1978</LINK>), or abnormalities in cardiac function measured by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. Clinical cardiotoxicity is defined on the basis of symptoms of clinical heart failure and confirmed by an abnormal diagnostic test. In end-stage clinical heart failure, heart transplantation is the only remaining option to avoid cardiac death.</P>
<P>The reported frequency of both clinical and subclinical cardiotoxicity after anthracycline therapy varies widely. In children, the prevalence of subclinical cardiac damage has been reported to be more than 57% at a median of 6.4 years after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002a</LINK>), and the incidence of clinical heart failure as high as 16% 0.9 to 4.8 years after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002b</LINK>). In adults, the prevalence of subclinical cardiac damage has been reported to be 36% during anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Nousiainen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nousiainen 2002</LINK>), and the incidence of clinical heart failure 30% at a median of 37 months after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Meinardi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinardi 2002</LINK>). However, we did not perform systematic reviews on the frequency of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in adults. Part of this variation can be explained by the type of anthracycline used, the total anthracycline dose, and the presence of additional risk factors for developing heart damage, such as radiation therapy involving the heart region, type of tumour, exposure to cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, iphosphamide, amsacrine, trastuzumab or taxanes, or the presence of pre-existing heart disease. There also seems to be a higher risk for females, children, and elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simbre-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simbre 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinicians confront a clinical dilemma as they balance the anti-tumour efficacy of anthracyclines against the associated cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent or reduce this toxicity, extensive research has been devoted to the identification of methods or drugs capable of ameliorating this toxicity, such as different anthracycline derivates (for example doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, and liposomal preparations) (<LINK REF="REF-Batist-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batist 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muggia-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muggia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2010</LINK>), cardioprotective agents (for example dexrazoxane) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2011</LINK>), or omitting anthracyclines altogether (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2014</LINK>). A different approach is the use of less cardiotoxic dosage schedules for anthracycline chemotherapy, that is peak anthracycline doses and duration of infusion of anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Legha-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legha 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important question regarding any anthracycline dosage schedule is whether it has a lower cardiotoxic effect without reducing the anti-tumour efficacy and without negative effects on toxicities other than cardiac damage, such as alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>This is the second update of the first systematic review on the cardiotoxicity of different anthracycline dosage schedules (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2009</LINK>). Since we performed the first update, long-term follow-up data on the use of different anthracycline infusion durations in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have become available. We have included all new evidence in this update.</P>

<P>We entered data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK> and analysed the data according to the guidelines in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Dichotomous variables were related to risk using the risk ratio. If possible, we extracted data by allocation intervention, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If this was not possible, we stated this. We assessed heterogeneity by both visual inspection of the forest plots and by a formal statistical test for heterogeneity, that is the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (I<SUP>2 </SUP>greater than 50% was considered substantial heterogeneity). If there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity, we reported this. We used a random-effects model throughout the review. We presented all the results with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. For survival, we used the generic inverse variance function of <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK> to combine logs of the hazard ratios (HRs). Where necessary, we used Parmar's method to extract the log of the HR and its standard error (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). We otherwise summarised survival qualitatively. For different anthracycline infusion durations, we used six hours as a cut-off point (that is greater than or equal to six hours versus less than six hours). In the protocol we stated that we would analyse different anthracycline peak doses as high (greater than or equal to 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) versus low doses (less than 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) received in one week. However, if we would have applied this definition to the included studies, pooling would not have been possible. Therefore, keeping in mind that any cut-off point would be arbitrary, we decided to define a low peak dose as less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> of the same anthracycline derivative in one week and a high peak dose as greater than or equal to 60 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>of the same anthracycline derivative in one week. Outcomes for which we could extract data from only one trial were summarised qualitatively. We took into account the risk of bias of included studies in the analyses and interpretation of the results of the review. For all outcomes for which pooling was possible, we performed sensitivity analyses for all 'Risk of bias' criteria separately. We excluded the low-quality studies and the studies for which the quality was unclear and compared the results of the good-quality studies with the results of all available studies. It was our intention to perform subgroup analyses for children and adults and leukaemias and solid tumours, but unfortunately this was not possible (see <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> for reasons).</P>

<P>After searching the electronic databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, and EMBASE/Ovid (4200 references, of which 1117 were identified in the current update), we included a total of nine articles that fulfilled all the criteria for considering studies for this review (one of these articles we identified in the current update and provided long-term follow-up data of an earlier included RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>), so the total number of included studies identified in the electronic database search was eight; one of these studies was included after receiving additional information from the first author (<LINK REF="STD-Heidenreich-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heidenreich 2004</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We excluded 44 articles for reasons described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.

We excluded the remaining 4147 articles since they were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), were laboratory studies, were animal studies, did not include people with cancer, did not describe anthracycline therapy with different dosage schedules, the cumulative anthracycline doses differed between intervention and control group, chemotherapy other than anthracyclines and/or radiotherapy involving the heart region differed between treatment groups, and/or did not have heart failure as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>We scanned reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and identified an additional 11 studies (none new in the current update), of which three fulfilled all criteria for considering studies for this review, whereas the other eight did not (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table).</P>

<P>The total number of identified RCTs was therefore 11 (described in 12 manuscripts; see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<P>Seven trials with a total of 803 participants addressed different anthracycline infusion durations (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). For 779 participants, it was clear to which treatment group they were randomised: 384 participants were randomised to an infusion duration of less than six hours, whereas 395 participants were randomised to an infusion duration of six hours or more. It was not documented to which group the other 24 participants were randomised (from the primary study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>). Three studies included children (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>), three studies included adults (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>), and the remaining study did not mention the age of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>). However, since participants in this study had either breast or ovarian cancer, it is likely that they were adults. In four studies, participants were treated with doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>), in two studies with daunorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>), and in one study with epirubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>). There were no important differences in cumulative anthracycline doses received in both treatment arms of the different RCTs. In three studies, participants were diagnosed with leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>), in two studies with soft tissue sarcoma (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>), in one study with breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>), and in one study with either breast cancer or ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>). In two studies, the follow-up of at least part of the included participants was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>); it is therefore possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In one study, the follow-up was only seven days; after the first daunorubicin administration, all children received additional daunorubicin with an infusion duration of one hour, so only data for the first seven days were eligible for this review, and only early acute cardiotoxicity could be evaluated in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>). In the other studies, the length of follow-up was not documented, and as a result we do not know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in these studies are early or late. However, given that most people included in these trials had advanced or metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presumed that cases of heart failure in these trials were early cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in <LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 2012</LINK>, the long-term follow-up study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>, it was stated that the bolus infusion was given within 15 minutes, instead of the 1-hour infusion duration documented in the primary publication of this study. The authors provided the following clarification: "all infusions were less than 1 hour and basically this was less than 15 minutes".</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of studies addressing different anthracycline peak doses</HEADING>
<P>Two trials with a total of 4146 adult participants with breast cancer compared a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (2103 participants) with a doxorubicin peak dose of 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more (2043 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Budman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Budman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 2007</LINK>). There were no important differences in cumulative anthracycline doses received in both treatment arms of the different RCTs. In one of the trials, the length of follow-up was more than one year for all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Budman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Budman 1998</LINK>); it is therefore possible that this study included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In the other trial, the length of follow-up was not documented, and as a result we do not know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in this study are early or late (<LINK REF="STD-Linden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 2007</LINK>). However, given that the median follow-up of participants still alive at the time of analysis was 7.2 years, it is possible that this study included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>One trial including 48 adults with prostate cancer compared liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) peak doses of 25 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (22 participants) and 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (26 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Heidenreich-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heidenreich 2004</LINK>). There were no important differences in cumulative anthracycline doses received in both treatment arms. The mean follow-up was 42 months; it is therefore possible that this study included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>One trial including 1086 adults with breast cancer compared epirubicin peak doses of 83 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (535 participants) and 110 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (551 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2008</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical heart failure</HEADING>
<P>We could collect data on clinical heart failure from 6 trials with a total of 735 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). However, since the eligible follow-up in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> was very short (that is only seven days), we felt it was inappropriate to include the data on clinical heart failure from this study in the pooled analyses. We therefore provide only descriptive results from this study: none of the participants included in <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> developed clinical heart failure within seven days after the start of treatment.</P>
<P>The other five trials included a total of 557 participants. There were 19 cases of clinical heart failure among 277 participants randomised to an infusion duration of less than 6 hours and 4 cases among 280 participants randomised to an infusion duration of 6 hours or more. In one study there were no cases of clinical heart failure in both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>), therefore the results of this study are not estimable for the meta-analysis of the RR. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration (RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.81; P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We detected no substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 2%).</P>
<P>Please note that for the study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> it was not possible to perform an intention-to-treat analysis (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Participants included in the meta-analysis were all adults diagnosed with a solid tumour. As the length of follow-up was not documented, we do not know if the cases of clinical heart failure included in the meta-analysis were early or late. However, given that most people included in these trials had advanced or metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that the cases of clinical heart failure in this meta-analysis were early cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK> from this analysis, since it did not report clinical heart failure.</P>
<P>Long-term follow-up data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> have been published on 92 of the 240 participants (N = 43 in the bolus group and N = 49 in the continuous infusion group) (<LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 2012</LINK>). The median length of follow-up was 8 years with a range of 3 to 13 years (8.3 years in the bolus group and 8.2 years in the continuous infusion group). Again, there were no cases of clinical heart failure in both treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical and subclinical heart failure combined</HEADING>
<P>We could extract data on clinical and subclinical heart failure combined from five trials, however we did not pool results because the definitions of subclinical heart failure used in the different trials were too diverse (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). We therefore provide descriptive results for these studies.</P>
<P>In four of the five studies, participants were adults diagnosed with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). As the length of follow-up was not documented, we do not know if the cases of heart failure included in the analyses were early or late. However, given that most participants included in these trials had advanced or metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that the cases of heart failure in the analyses were early cardiotoxicity. In one of the five studies, participants were children with leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>). As the eligible follow-up duration of this study was seven days, we could only evaluate early cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>In two out of five studies, a statistically significant difference in favour of participants randomised to an infusion duration of six hours or more was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>), while in the other studies no significant differences were found (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Since in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> no participants developed clinical or subclinical heart failure, we did not include a figure for this study.</P>
<P>We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> from this analysis (both the original study and the long-term follow-up study), as the number of participants that developed subclinical heart failure was not provided, and only cases of clinical heart failure were thus included in the results. We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK> because clinical heart failure was not evaluated, and therefore the results only included cases of subclinical heart failure.</P>
<P>For all studies, it should be noted that participants who suffered from clinical heart failure are also included in the meta-analysis of clinical heart failure as mentioned above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subclinical heart failure described as a continuous outcome</HEADING>
<P>We could collect data on subclinical heart failure described as a continuous outcome from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>), however we did not pool results because the definitions of subclinical heart failure used in the different trials were too diverse (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We therefore provide descriptive results of these studies. Two studies evaluated children diagnosed with leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>), whereas the third study evaluated adults with a solid tumour.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> provided the median Z score of different echocardiographic parameters (bolus group versus continuous infusion group): diastolic dimension (-0.12 versus -0.23), wall thickness (-0.32 versus -0.28), systolic dimension (0.85 versus 0.38), left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) (-2.34 versus -1.77), and mass (-0.65 versus -0.47). None of the differences were significant. Please note that only a small percentage of the randomised participants were evaluated for this outcome (21% to 26%). Long-term follow-up data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> have been published on 92 of the 240 participants (N = 43 in the bolus group and N = 49 in the continuous infusion group) (<LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 2012</LINK>). The median length of follow-up was 8 years with a range of 3 to 13 years (8.3 years in the bolus group and 8.2 years in the continuous infusion group). Again no significant differences were identified for different echocardiographic parameters at three, six, and eight years after tumour diagnosis: LVSF, left ventricular end diastolic posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass, left ventricular end systolic dimension, and left ventricular end diastolic dimension. Not all participants were assessed at all three time points.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK> provided the mean fall in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which was 17% in the bolus group versus 4% in the continuous infusion group at a cumulative anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and 21% in the bolus group versus 6% in the continuous infusion group at a cumulative anthracycline dose of 400 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. This difference between both groups is highly significant for both doses (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK> provided the median change in LVSF, which was -6.5 for the bolus group and +1 for the continuous infusion group. It was not stated if this is a significant difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Response rate</HEADING>
<P>We could extract data on response rate from 2 trials with a total of 292 adult participants with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). These trials used comparable criteria to assess tumour response (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). There were 23 complete or partial responses among 143 participants randomised to an infusion duration of less than 6 hours, and 28 among 149 participants randomised to an infusion duration of 6 hours or more. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the response rate between both treatment groups (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.22; P = 0.56) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3)</LINK>. We detected no substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 16%). None of the studies documented that the response rate was determined by at least two observers.</P>
<P>The study of <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> (178 children with leukaemia) did report the number of good and poor responses at day 7. As the definition of response rate was not comparable with the above studies, and also due to the short eligible follow-up duration (that is seven days), we did not include the results of this study in the meta-analysis. However, no statistically significant difference in response rate between both treatment groups was identified (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.66; P = 0.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). It was not documented if the response rate was determined by at least two observers.</P>
<P>We excluded the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> (both the original study and the long-term follow-up study), <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK> from this analysis because none of these studies documented the response rate per treatment group.</P>
<P>Please note that due to the nature of this measurement (that is the number of participants with a remission), a high event rate is favourable; therefore, in the graph of this analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), 'favours less than six hours' is on the left, and 'favours greater than or equal to six hours' is on the right, as opposed to the graphs of the other analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Survival</HEADING>
<P>None of the seven included studies evaluated PFS of participants randomised to different infusion durations (only data from the first seven treatment days for the study of <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> were eligible for this review; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>
<P>We could extract data on OS from 2 trials with a total of 322 adults with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>). One study presented the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI (<LINK REF="STD-Zalupski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zalupski 1991</LINK>), and the other study provided a survival curve (<LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>). The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the treatment groups (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.30; P = 0.42) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). However, we detected unexplained heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 75.0%).</P>
<P>Please note that for the study of <LINK REF="STD-Casper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1991</LINK>, it was not possible to perform an intention-to-treat analysis because the survival data were presented with a participant randomised to bolus therapy who actually received the drug by continuous infusion in the continuous infusion group.</P>
<P>We excluded the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> (both the original study and the long-term follow-up study), <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK> from this analysis because none of these studies documented OS per treatment group. <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> did mention the five-year event-free survival (EFS) for the different treatment groups, and no significant difference was identified (89% EFS in the short infusion group and 87.3% in the continuous infusion group; P = 0.50). Long-term follow-up data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> have been published on 92 of the 240 participants (N = 43 in the bolus group and N = 49 in the continuous infusion group) (<LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 2012</LINK>). The median length of follow-up was 8 years with a range of 3 to 13 years (8.3 years in the bolus group and 8.2 years in the continuous infusion group). Again, no significant difference in EFS between both treatment groups was identified (10-year EFS 79% in the bolus group versus 83% in the continuous infusion group; P = 0.24).</P>
<P>We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK> from this analysis because we were not able to reliably extract data needed to use Parmar's method for the assessment of survival for this study. However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 1989</LINK> study participants randomised to an infusion duration of less than 6 hours had a median survival of 7 months (range 1 to 19+ months), and participants randomised to an infusion duration of 6 hours or more had a median survival of 9 months (range 1 to 21 months). <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK> did not report overall survival.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects other than cardiac damage</HEADING>
<P>Since only one study including adults with a solid tumour provided adequate data on adverse effects other than cardiac damage (<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 1990</LINK>), pooling of results was not possible. We therefore provide descriptive results for this study. All analyses were performed in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK> with the random-effects model. Given that all participants receiving anthracycline chemotherapy will suffer from side effects, we decided to analyse only the severe and life-threatening effects. We defined this as grade 3 or 4 toxicity. We could only evaluate fatal sepsis. One participant randomised to an infusion duration of less than six hours died as the result of a sepsis. No statistically significant difference was identified between the treatment arms (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.92, P = 0.50).</P>

It is therefore possible that this study included cases of both early and late clinical heart failure. In the other trial, the length of follow-up was not documented, and as a result we do not know if the cases of clinical heart failure in this study are early or late (<LINK REF="STD-Linden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 2007</LINK>). However, given that the median follow-up of participants still alive at the time of analysis was 7.2 years, it is possible that this study included cases of both early and late clinical heart failure.</P>

<P>Given that all people receiving anthracycline chemotherapy will suffer from side effects, we decided to analyse only the severe and life-threatening effects. We defined this as grade 3 or 4 toxicity. We evaluated the following adverse effects: treatment-related death, granulocytopenia (grade 4), leukopenia (grade 4), thrombocytopenia (grade 4), diarrhoea (grade 3 or 4), dyspnoea (grade 3 or 4), infection (grade 3 or 4), malaise/fatigue/lethargy (grade 3 or 4), nausea (grade 3 or 4), stomatitis (grade 3 or 4), vomiting (grade 3 or 4), pharynx/esophagitis (grade 3 or 4), phlebitis/thrombosis/embolism (grade 3 or 4), fever without infection (grade 3 or 4), oedema (grade 3 or 4), and hypotension (grade 3 or 4) (<LINK REF="STD-Linden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 2007</LINK>), leukopenia grade 3 or 4 (i.e. fewer than 1900 cells/l) and death attributable to chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Budman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Budman 1998</LINK>). However, since the trials did not use comparable definitions, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-02-24 11:37:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heart damage due to anthracycline chemotherapy is a considerable and serious problem. It reduces QoL and can even cause premature death. Also, when heart damage occurs during therapy, the maximum cumulative dose of anthracyclines needs to be limited resulting in reduced efficacy of anthracycline chemotherapy.</P>
<P>This is the second update of the first systematic review evaluating the existing evidence on different anthracycline dosage schedules (that is different infusion durations and different peak doses) for reducing cardiotoxicity. We included only RCTs as it is widely recognised that only this study design can obtain unbiased evidence on the use of anthracyclines, provided that the design and execution are adequate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Different anthracycline infusion durations</HEADING>
<P>We identified seven trials for different anthracycline infusion durations. These trials all compared a bolus infusion (up to a maximum of 1 hour; for the <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> study the exact duration of bolus infusion was not clear, as in one publication it was stated to be 1 hour, while in another publication it was stated to be within 15 minutes; the authors provided the following clarification: "all infusions were less than 1 hour and basically this was less than 15 minutes") with a longer infusion duration (varying from 6 to 96 hours). Our meta-analysis of five trials showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.81). This finding is supported by two out of five individual studies evaluating clinical and subclinical heart failure combined, which also showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in participants randomised to an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to participants randomised to a shorter infusion duration. Also, one of the two individual studies evaluating the significance of the difference in subclinical heart failure as a continuous outcome between both treatment groups showed a significant difference in the mean fall of the left ventricular ejection fraction in favour of the infusion duration of six hours or longer. Another study did not mention the significance of the difference.</P>
<P>However, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the intervention could selectively decrease the heart damage by anthracyclines without reducing the antitumour efficacy (that is tumour response and patient survival) and without negative effects on QoL and toxicities other than cardiac damage. Our meta-analysis of two trials for response rate showed no significant difference between both treatment groups. One study evaluated the number of good responses at day seven and identified no significant difference between the treatment groups. Also no statistically significant difference in OS was found between the treatment groups in our meta-analysis of two trials, but please note that there was unexplained heterogeneity. No data on PFS was available. This review does not allow for any conclusions regarding adverse effects other than cardiac damage and QoL in participants treated with different anthracycline infusion durations.</P>
<P>It should be kept in mind that the inclusion of studies for this systematic review was limited to RCTs describing cardiotoxicity, and as a result, the analyses of response rate, survival, adverse effects other than cardiac damage, and QoL were possibly based on only a subgroup of trials comparing different anthracycline infusion durations.</P>
<P>It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. The reason that some studies did not identify a significant difference between both study groups could be due to the fact that the number of participants included in these studies was too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (that is low power). Furthermore, the length of follow-up could have been too short to detect a significant difference between the treatment groups. This is especially true for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>, in which the eligible follow-up was only seven days.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that the majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. Subgroup analyses for children versus adults and leukaemias versus solid tumours were not possible. We could not include children with leukaemia in the performed meta-analyses, but included them in the descriptive results of non-pooled studies. Two studies with children diagnosed with leukaemia evaluated clinical heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>), and identified no differences (however, as mentioned above, one of these studies had a very short follow-up of only seven days). Long-term follow-up data (median length of follow-up 8 years with a range of 3 to 13 years) of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> showed the same result. Three studies with children diagnosed with leukaemia evaluated subclinical heart failure, of which two studies assessed the significance of the difference between both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>). Again, no differences were identified; the long-term follow-up data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> did not change these results. The third study suggested a decrease in left ventricular shortening fraction in children treated with bolus infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>). One study with children diagnosed with leukaemia evaluated response rate (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>). This study identified no difference in response, but it should be noted that the follow-up was only seven days. We could obtain no information regarding PFS and OS, adverse effects other than cardiac damage, and QoL for paediatric participants. However, <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> did mention the five-year event-free survival for the different treatment groups, and no significant difference was identified (89% event-free survival in the short infusion group and 87.3% in the continuous infusion group; P = 0.50). The same was true for the long-term follow-up data: 10-year event-free survival 79% in the bolus group versus 83% in the continuous infusion group; P = 0.24.</P>
<P>Regarding early and late cardiotoxicity, we must conclude the following. Only two studies in children documented that the follow-up of at least part of the included participants was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1993</LINK>). It is therefore possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. One study in children had a follow-up of only seven days, so in this study we could evaluate only acute cardiotoxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Escherich-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Escherich 2007</LINK>). All participants in the long-term follow-up study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2002</LINK> had a follow-up of at least three years, so in this study we could evaluate late cardiotoxicity. The other studies did not document the length of follow-up, and as a result we do not know if the cases of cardiotoxicity were early or late. However, given that most participants included in these trials had advanced or metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that cases of heart failure in these trials were early cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>As described earlier, the risk of bias in the included studies varied; in many studies we could not rule out bias due to lack of reporting. However, currently this is the best available evidence of RCTs evaluating different anthracycline infusion durations.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the included RCTs used three different anthracycline derivatives (doxorubicin, epirubicin, and daunorubicin), and we assumed that they all behaved similarly. We therefore combined them in the meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Different anthracycline peak doses</HEADING>
<P>We identified two trials for different doxorubicin peak doses. These trials compared a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> with a doxorubicin peak dose of 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more (that is 40 versus 60 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>or 54 versus 81 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups, but please note that there was unexplained heterogeneity. No information on subclinical heart failure was provided, and therefore no conclusions can be made regarding this outcome. Again, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the intervention could selectively decrease the heart damage by anthracyclines without reducing the antitumour efficacy and without negative effects on QoL and toxicities other than cardiac damage. Our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in OS between the treatment groups. With regard to adverse effects other than cardiac damage, pooling of results was not possible. In the individual studies the results were not unambiguous: for most evaluated adverse effects a significant difference in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> was identified, but for others either no difference between the treatment groups was identified or there was a significant difference in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of 60 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>or more. No information on response rate, PFS and QoL was provided, and therefore no conclusions can be made regarding these outcomes.</P>
<P>In the study evaluating 25 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>versus 50 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx), no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified for both clinical and subclinical heart failure. Again, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the intervention could selectively decrease the heart damage by anthracyclines without reducing the antitumour efficacy and without negative effects on QoL and toxicities other than cardiac damage. For response rate (defined as a reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by greater than or equal to 50% relative to baseline, with this reduction persisting for greater than or equal to four weeks and being accompanied by stabilisation or improvement in the participant's performance status) a borderline-significant difference in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of 50 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>was identified (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.13; P = 0.05). However, the significance of PSA reduction as a surrogate marker for response and survival must be considered with caution. The clinical relevance of decreased PSA levels remains subject to debate (<LINK REF="REF-Millikan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millikan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verbel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbel 2002</LINK>). With regard to adverse effects other than cardiac damage, the results were not unambiguous: for most evaluated adverse effects no significant difference between both treatment groups was identified, but for others either a significant difference in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of 25 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> was shown. No significant difference in the QoL between the treatment groups was identified. No information on PFS and OS was provided, and therefore no conclusions can be made regarding these outcomes.</P>
<P>In the study evaluating 83 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> versus 110 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>epirubicin, no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified for clinical heart failure. No information on subclinical heart failure was provided, and therefore no conclusions can be made regarding this outcome. Again, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the intervention could selectively decrease the heart damage by anthracyclines without reducing the antitumour efficacy and without negative effects on QoL and toxicities other than cardiac damage. With regard to adverse effects other than cardiac damage, the results were not unambiguous: for most evaluated adverse effects no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified, whereas for some a significant difference in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of 83 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> was identified. No information on response rate, PFS and OS and QoL was provided, and therefore no conclusions can be made regarding these outcomes.</P>
<P>It should be kept in mind that the inclusion of studies for this systematic review was limited to RCTs describing cardiotoxicity, and as a result, the analyses of response rate, survival, adverse effects other than cardiac damage, and QoL were possibly based on only a subgroup of trials comparing different anthracycline peak doses.</P>
<P>It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. The reason that some studies did not identify a significant difference between both study groups could be due to the fact that the number of participants included in these studies was too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (that is low power). Furthermore, the length of follow-up could have been too short to detect a significant difference between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that all participants included in the studies evaluating different anthracycline peak doses were adults with different solid tumours. As a result, subgroup analyses for children versus adults and leukaemia versus solid tumours were not possible.</P>
<P>Regarding early and late cardiotoxicity, we must conclude the following. In three studies, the follow-up of at least part of the included participants was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Budman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Budman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidenreich-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heidenreich 2004</LINK>). It is therefore possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. The fourth study did not mention the length of follow-up, and as a result we do not know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in this studies were early or late (<LINK REF="STD-Linden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 2007</LINK>). However, given that the median follow-up of participants still alive at the time of analysis was 7.2 years, it is possible that this study included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>As described earlier, the risk of bias in the included studies varied; in many studies we could not rule out bias due to lack of reporting. However, currently this is the best available evidence of RCTs evaluating different anthracycline peak doses.</P>
<P>We identified eligible RCTs for only for a limited number of anthracycline peak doses. We found no appropriate studies for other combinations, and therefore can make no conclusions regarding the use of these combinations in preventing anthracycline-induced heart failure in participants treated with anthracyclines.</P>
<P>Also, more definitions of anthracycline peak doses than the one we used in this systematic review (that is the maximal anthracycline dose received in one week) are possible, for example single-dose infusion versus consecutive divided daily doses. To evaluate all the available evidence on the exact role of other kinds of peak doses on the occurrence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in adults and children, one or more new (Cochrane) systematic reviews can be initiated. These systematic reviews should focus not only on anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, but also on antitumour efficacy, adverse effects other than cardiac damage, and QoL.</P>
<P>We are awaiting the full-text publication of the trial currently awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2006</LINK>); from the currently available data it is unclear if this study is eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different anthracycline infusion durations</HEADING>
<P>For different anthracycline infusion durations, our meta-analysis clearly showed that an anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and in individual studies it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical heart failure. There is no evidence suggesting a difference in response rate and survival between the treatment groups. We can make no conclusions regarding adverse effects other than cardiac damage and QoL. It should be emphasised that the majority of the participants included in these studies were adults with advanced solid tumours. We found no new studies since the last version of this review.</P>
<P>We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high or if it is necessary to administer a higher cumulative anthracycline dose, it might be justified to use an infusion duration of six hours or longer in people with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of a longer infusion duration against the uncertain risk of a reduced antitumour efficacy and adverse effects other than cardiac damage for each individual patient. We found no new studies since the last version of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different anthracycline peak doses</HEADING>
<P>For different doxorubicin peak doses (that is less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> versus 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more), our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups. There is no evidence suggesting a difference in overall survival between the treatment groups. We could not pool the results of adverse effects other than cardiac damage, but they were not unambiguous in the individual studies. No information on subclinical heart failure, response rate, PFS and QoL was provided. It should be emphasised that all participants included in these studies were adults with solid tumours. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to favour a doxorubicin peak dose of either less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Since we identified only one RCT evaluating a liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) peak dose of 25 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>versus 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, we can make no definitive conclusions regarding this peak dose. No significant differences between the treatment groups for both clinical and subclinical heart failure were identified. There was a borderline-significant difference in response rate in favour of participants treated with a peak dose of 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. No significant difference between the treatment groups for QoL was shown. However, these findings should be confirmed in other RCTs. The results of adverse effects other than cardiac damage were not unambiguous. No information on PFS and OS was provided. It should be emphasised that the all participants included in these studies were adults with solid tumours. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to make recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Since we identified only one RCT evaluating an epirubicin peak dose of 83 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> versus 110 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, we can make no definitive conclusions regarding this peak dose. No significant difference between the treatment groups for clinical heart failure was identified. However, this finding should be confirmed in other RCTs. The results of adverse effects other than cardiac damage were not unambiguous. No information on subclinical heart failure, response rate, PFS and QoL was provided. It should be emphasised that all the participants included in these studies were adults with solid tumours. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to make recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
<P>As no high-quality evidence was available for other combinations of anthracycline peak doses, we can make no conclusions about the efficacy of different peak doses in preventing heart damage in people treated with anthracyclines. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to make recommendations for clinical practice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different anthracycline infusion durations</HEADING>
<P>Since there is only a small amount of data for children and also because data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. Future RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations treated for either a haematological malignancy or a solid tumour using valid outcome definitions (including cardiotoxicity, response rate, survival, and adverse effects other than cardiac damage). The follow-up should be long enough to identify late-onset cardiotoxic effects. The number of included participants should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable. Also, it will be very interesting to examine long-term follow-up data from the already performed RCTs.</P>

<P>We stated in the protocol that we would analyse different anthracycline peak doses as high (greater than or equal to 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) versus low (less than 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) doses received in one week. However, if we would have applied this definition to the included studies, pooling would not have been possible. Therefore, keeping in mind that any cut-off point is arbitrary, we decided to define a low peak dose as less than 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> and a high peak dose as greater than or equal to 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>For the second update we used the most recent recommendations of Cochrane Childhood Cancer for the assessment of risk of bias in the included studies, which are based on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. </I>All publications (including those already included in earlier versions of the review) were scored using the new 'Risk of bias' items.</P>

<P>There was a third treatment group in this study, i.e. a doxorubicin peak dose of 30 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. However, women in this group were excluded from this review because the cumulative doses of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil were lower than the other treatment groups.</P>
