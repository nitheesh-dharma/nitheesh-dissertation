<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:28:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>The issue</B>
<BR/>There is a risk of serious complications developing after radiation treatment (radiotherapy) for cancer (late radiation tissue injury (LRTI)). These problems can be very difficult to resolve and there is some doubt as to the best approaches to treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing oxygen in a specially designed chamber. It is used as a treatment to improve oxygen supply to damaged tissue (cells within the body) and support healing.</P>
<P>
<B>The aim of the review</B>
<BR/>We searched medical databases for clinical studies aimed to find the evidence for or against the ability of HBOT, compared to either no treatment or alternative treatments, to improve these complications. The evidence was current to December 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>What were the main findings?</B>
<BR/>There was some evidence that HBOT improved outcome in LRTI affecting bone and soft tissues of the head and neck, for radiation proctitis (inflammation of the lower part of the large intestine caused by radiotherapy treatment) and to prevent the development of osteoradionecrosis (bone death caused by radiotherapy treatment) following tooth extraction in an irradiated field. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on tissues in the nervous system.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The evidence was generally of moderate quality and limited by small numbers of participants, poor reporting of methods and results, and uncertainty as to the exact degree of improvement with HBOT.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the conclusions?</B>
<BR/>The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues may be justified. Studies of radiation injury suggest that other tissues are also likely to respond (e.g. bladder). Further research is required to establish which people may respond and the best timing of such therapy. A study of costs would also be useful.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:24:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Cancer is a significant global health problem. Radiotherapy is a treatment for many cancers and about 50% of people having radiotherapy will be long-term survivors. Some will experience late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) developing months or years later. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a treatment for LRTI based upon the ability to improve the blood supply to these tissues. It is postulated that HBOT may result in both healing of tissues and the prevention of problems following surgery.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-13 10:35:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, DORCTIHM and reference lists of articles in December 2015. We also searched for ongoing trials at clinicaltrials.gov.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of HBOT versus no HBOT on LRTI prevention or healing.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-22 13:31:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Three review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant trials using the guidelines of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and extracted the data from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-12 22:15:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Fourteen trials contributed to this review (753 participants). There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk ratio (RR) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies). There was also moderate quality evidence of a significantly improved chance of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.04, NNTB 4; 264 participants, 2 studies). From single studies there was a significantly increased chance of improvement or cure following HBOT for radiation proctitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9, P value = 0.04, NNTB 5), and following both surgical flaps (RR 8.7; 95% CI 2.7 to 27.5, P value = 0.0002, NNTB 4) and hemimandibulectomy (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8, P value = 0.001, NNTB 5). There was also a significantly improved probability of healing irradiated tooth sockets following dental extraction (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, P value = 0.009, NNTB 4).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of benefit in clinical outcomes with established radiation injury to neural tissue, and no randomised data reported on the use of HBOT to treat other manifestations of LRTI. These trials did not report adverse events.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:27:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>These small trials suggest that for people with LRTI affecting tissues of the head, neck, anus and rectum, HBOT is associated with improved outcome. HBOT also appears to reduce the chance of ORN following tooth extraction in an irradiated field. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tissues. The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues may be justified. Further research is required to establish the optimum participant selection and timing of any therapy. An economic evaluation should be undertaken.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:29:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:29:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Cancer is a significant global health problem. According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, in 2012 more than 14 million people were diagnosed with cancer, and cancer caused more than eight million deaths the same year (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2013</LINK>). Radiotherapy is a well-established treatment of suitable malignancies in a wide variety of anatomical areas. Of the approximately 1.2 million new cases of invasive cancer diagnosed annually in the USA, for example, about 50% will receive radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2002</LINK>), and of these about 50% will be long-term survivors. While radiotherapy may acutely injure any normal tissue in the path of the radiation, this acute injury generally heals spontaneously following completion of the treatment course. Serious radiation-related complications developing months or years after radiation treatment, collectively known as late radiation tissue injury (LRTI), are relatively rare and will affect between 5% and 15% of those long-term survivors who received radiotherapy, although the incidence varies widely with dose, age and site (<LINK REF="REF-Flannigan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flannigan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1999</LINK>). Although any tissue may be affected, LRTI is in practice most common in the head and neck, chest wall, breast and pelvis - reflecting the anatomical areas most commonly irradiated and the likelihood of survival for people treated for cancer at these anatomical sites.</P>
<P>When LRTIs occur, tissues undergo a progressive deterioration characterised by a reduction in the density of small blood vessels (reduced vascularity) and the replacement of normal tissue cells with dense fibrous tissue (fibrosis), until there is insufficient oxygen supplied to sustain normal function. This situation is frequently exacerbated by secondary damage due to infection or surgery in the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1984</LINK>). This progressive and delayed radiation damage may reach a critical point where the tissue breaks down to form an ulcer or area of cell death (radiation necrosis or radionecrosis). LRTI can affect any organ system, although some tissues are more sensitive to radiation effects than others (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trott-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trott 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Historically, the management of these injuries has been unsatisfactory. LRTI may be life threatening and may significantly reduce quality of life (QoL). Conservative treatment is usually restricted to symptom management, while definitive treatment traditionally entails surgery to remove the affected part and extensive repair (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2003</LINK>). Surgical intervention in an irradiated field is often disfiguring and associated with an increased incidence of delayed healing, breakdown of a surgical wound or infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been widely reported to improve LRTI in a wide range of tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hampson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampson 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>HBOT has been proposed to improve tissue quality, promote healing and prevent breakdown of irradiated tissue fields. It may be defined as the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Administration involves placing the person in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and giving 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the lungs, blood and tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 2.0 and 2.5 ATA for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or twice daily to a total of 30 to 60 sessions of treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:29:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The intermittent application of HBOT is the only intervention that has been shown to increase the number of blood vessels in irradiated tissue. This has been demonstrated by Marx in a rabbit mandibular (jaw bone) model and further confirmed by serial tissue oxygen level measurements using electrodes placed on the overlying skin (transcutaneous oximetry (PtcO<SUB>2</SUB>)) in humans undergoing a course of therapy for radiation necrosis of the mandible (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marx-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1990</LINK>). In the rabbit study, the jaw and surrounding soft tissues were heavily irradiated and one group 'rescued' with HBOT six months later. The two control groups showed no improvement while a series of 20 sessions at 2.4 ATA on 100% oxygen returned the density of blood vessels to 80% of normal. In the human study, a progressive recovery of low PtcO<SUB>2</SUB> readings into the normal range was achieved in a group of people receiving therapy for underlying osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (radiation necrosis of bone).</P>
<P>HBOT seems most likely to achieve such improvements through a complex series of changes in affected tissues. Tissue swelling is probably improved through an osmotic effect of oxygen, while the establishment of a steep oxygen gradient across an irradiated tissue margin is a powerful stimulus to the growth of new blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hills-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1999</LINK>). In addition, improving oxygen levels will improve white cell and fibroblast function, further enhancing wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 1974</LINK>). Improved tissue quality has been demonstrated in a model of radiation small bowel injury (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:29:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>While HBOT has been used for LRTI since at least 1975 (<LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1975</LINK>), most clinical studies have been limited to relatively small case series or individual case reports. There have been relatively few comparative studies published, and no previous quantitative systematic reviews of which we are aware. In one semi-quantitative review, Feldmeier and Hampson located 71 such reports involving 1193 participants across eight different tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2002</LINK>). In these participants, for whom conservative treatment had failed to improve symptoms, there were clinically significant improvements in the majority of people. Results varied between tissue types, with neurological tissue appearing the most resistant to improvement. Only 7 of 71 reports indicated a generally poor response to HBOT. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Hoggan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoggan 2014</LINK> systematically reviewed the literature and found 11 studies of HBOT for LRTI, concluding there was support for the use of HBOT in selected tissues. The present review complements <LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Hoggan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoggan 2014</LINK> by using explicit Cochrane methodology to locate, quantitatively appraise and summarise the comparative data, while not discussing in any detail the non-comparative series summarised in those reviews.</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse events including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure; temporary worsening of short sightedness (myopia); claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention. It has further been suggested that HBOT may increase the incidence and rate, or both, of growth of tumours in people with a history of malignancy. One comprehensive review did not support these concerns (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2003</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:39:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We used CATmaker to calculate between-group comparisons for single trials when the report authors did not do so (<LINK REF="REF-CEBM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEBM 2004</LINK>). For all other measures of treatment effect, we used Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). It was our intention where possible to analyse the data from different anatomical sites together (see outcomes listed under 'all anatomical areas'). However, many outcomes are specific to a particular anatomical site, and we analysed these outcomes separately. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis where possible and comparisons reflect efficacy in the context of randomised trialling, rather than true effectiveness in any particular clinical context. While we planned to compare survival over time using the log hazard ratio and variance (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>), we found no suitable data. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RRs). For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) between treatment and control groups in each trial and aggregated MDs using inverse variance weights to estimate an overall MD and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of significant clinical heterogeneity between studies (see below), and employed a random-effects model when such heterogeneity was likely. We used Review Manager 5 for all statistical analysis (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>

As an estimate of the clinical relevance of any difference between experimental intervention and control intervention, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) with 95% CI as appropriate, using the formula NNTB = 1/risk difference (RD) with 95% CI calculated from the 95% CI of the RR, following the method recommended in <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>.</LI>

At 12 months, the global score was 66.7 (SD 13.6) in the HBOT group versus 84.3 (SD 19.7) in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>). The authors analysed the changes from baseline in each and found no significant differences between groups because entry scores were lower in the HBOT group.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Svalestad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Svalestad 2014</LINK> trial was reported in two papers, one in 2014 and one in 2015.</P>
<P>This trial enrolled 22 participants with clinical LRTI who were referred for consideration of HBOT. Fourteen participants (64%) were allocated to HBOT and eight (36%) to delayed treatment for a minimum of six months. The first report included all participants and reported on LDF and PtcO<SUB>2</SUB> results before and after treatment. The later report added histopathological data on the 20 participants who consented to tissue biopsies in the irradiated gingival mucosa (see <LINK REF="STD-Svalestad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Svalestad 2014</LINK>). It reported all outcomes as changes from baseline in each group rather than a direct comparison between groups.</P>
<P>This trial reported an increase in LDF (measured as blood flow expressed in 'perfusion units') in the HBOT group at six months after treatment, but not the controls (HBOT: baseline cheek blood flow 104 (SD 64) and at six months 306 (SD 237), P value &lt; 0.05; control baseline 142 (SD 67) and six months 143 (SD 79), P value &gt; 0.05). Similarly, there was an increase in PtcO<SUB>2</SUB> during the course of the study in the HBOT group, but not the control (HBOT baseline 14.0 mm Hg (SD 5.8) and six months 19.8 mm Hg (SD 6.5), P value &lt; 0.05; control 14.0 mm Hg (SD 5.0) and 12.7 mm Hg (SD 4.6), P value &gt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In the second report, both MVD and area were (similarly) significantly increased in the subepithelial tissue following HBOT, but not in the control group participants. For MVD, the HBOT group at baseline was 1.5 vessels/mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.6) and this increased at six months to 4.4 vessels/mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 1.9) (P value = 0.003) and the control group baseline was 1.5 vessels/mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.6) and at six months was 1.6 vessels/mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.5)(P value &gt; 0.05). There were similar results for the total area of the microvasculature. The authors also reported the 'proliferation index', which is a measure of the rate at which cells proliferate in the tissue under study. The rate was unaffected by HBOT in this study.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:20:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review was updated in December 2015 and included three new studies. In total, we included data from 14 trials including 753 participants. However, the final conclusions have not been substantially altered.</P>
<P>In general, these trials suggest a benefit from HBOT for non-neurological radiation tissue injury. There was moderate quality evidence from three trials that complete mucosal cover of exposed bone was more likely to be achieved in people with ORN when HBOT was administered (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.55) and from two trials that wound dehiscence was less likely following operations to repair mandibular ORN with the addition of HBOT (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.83).</P>
<P>Other main results are taken from individual studies. <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1985</LINK> reported an increased chance of successful healing with HBOT compared to antibiotic cover for tooth extraction in an irradiated field (absolute risk reduction (ARR) 25%, P value = 0.02). <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2008</LINK> reported some evidence that HBOT improved the probability of healing in radiation proctitis (ARR 8%) and a greater mean improvement in the severity of symptoms (LENT-SOMA score improvement: 5 points with HBOT and 2.6 points with control). <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK> reported a reduction in pelvic pain following both HBOT and installation of HA into the urinary bladder for people with radiation cystitis, while <LINK REF="STD-Pritchard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pritchard 2001</LINK> showed no improvements in pain associated with radiation brachial plexopathy with HBOT compared to control. <LINK REF="STD-Teguh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teguh 2009</LINK> reported improvements in xerostomia (P value = 0.009), dysphagia (P value = 0.011) and mouth pain (P value &lt; 0.001) in people with radiation injury to the head and neck compared to untreated controls. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Schoen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schoen 2007</LINK> reported no evidence that HBOT improved the chance of healing for dental implants into an irradiated field.</P>
<P>Several trials reported different measures of QoL and functional outcome following HBOT for radiation injury in the head and neck, bowel and axilla. Pooling was not appropriate for these outcomes. In general, these trials presented positive improvements with the head and neck and bowel, but not the neurological injury or lymphoedema associated with axillary radiation injury. One factor that may have influenced this was the well-established nature of the axillary injury in <LINK REF="STD-Pritchard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pritchard 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gothard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gothard 2010</LINK> (88% had a time from radiotherapy to HBOT of 10 years or more in <LINK REF="STD-Pritchard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pritchard 2001</LINK>, mean time from radiotherapy to HBOT was more than 11 years in <LINK REF="STD-Gothard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gothard 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:20:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review identified 14 trials investigating the use of HBOT for tissue damaged by LRTI, and we believe these represent all randomised trials in humans in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of searching the listed databases.</P>
<P>These trials were published over a 25-year period up to 2014, and from a large geographical area. The trials studied a wide variety of people with LRTI and HBOT seems to have been generally well tolerated and safe. Clinical heterogeneity and differences in the outcomes measured meant that we performed few pooled analyses with these data and consequently our conclusions were limited.</P>
<P>We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to anatomical location, dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course), nature of the comparative treatment modalities and the severity of injury. However, the paucity of eligible trials and poor reporting of some trials suggested that these analyses would not be informative. The oxygen dose used was reasonably standard over most trials. Participant inclusion criteria were not standard, and poorly reported in some trials. Specific comparator therapies were generally not employed.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review did not systematically report the incidence of adverse events. There are a number of minor complications that may occur commonly. Visual disturbance, usually reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported - perhaps as many as 50% of people having a course of 30 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). While the great majority of people recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, a small proportion of people continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. The second most common adverse event associated with HBOT is middle-ear barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Ear barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and usually requires active effort by the person in order to inflate the middle ear through the Eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly, but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Most episodes of barotrauma are mild, easily treated or recover spontaneously and do not require the therapy to be abandoned.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:20:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Many of the trials enrolled modest numbers of participants, particularly the trial investigating cerebral radiation injury, which reported only seven participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hulshof-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hulshof 2002</LINK>). Our confidence in the two pooled estimates was downgraded due to poor reporting of potential biases in two trials and imprecision in the estimated improvements with HBOT (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Other problems for this review were the poor methodological quality of some of these trials (particularly <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999b</LINK>), variability in entry criteria, and the nature and timing of outcomes, and poor reporting of both outcomes and methodology. In particular, there is a possibility of bias due to different anatomical locations and extent of tissue damage on entry to these trials, as well as from non-blinded management decisions in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Marx-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999b</LINK>). Further, it is not clear when the participants for <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999b</LINK> were recruited - these trials may represent work from some years earlier.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:21:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>While we have made every effort to locate further unpublished data, it remains possible this review is subject to a positive publication bias, with generally favourable trials more likely to achieve reporting. With regard to long-term outcomes following HBOT and any effect on the QoL for these people, we have located few relevant data. Encouragingly, we have identified six ongoing trials that seem likely eligible for inclusion in future updates of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Forner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Forner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gesell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gesell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOPON-2011" TYPE="STUDY">HOPON 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhnt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhnt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oscarsson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Oscarsson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yarnold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yarnold 2010</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:21:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Our review is broadly consistent with recent systematic reviews in this area. <LINK REF="REF-Hoggan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoggan 2014</LINK> found 11 articles comparing HBOT with no HBOT for the treatment of LRTI and concluded that "HBOT is a safe intervention which may offer clinical benefits to patients suffering from radiation proctitis and non-neurological STRI [soft tissue radiation-related injuries] of the head and neck". They called for further high-quality trials to determine more precisely the role of HBOT in this area. In a review of HBOT for gynaecological malignancies, <LINK REF="STD-Craighead-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Craighead 2011</LINK> suggested that HBOT is "likely effective for late radiation tissue injury of the pelvis" in otherwise refractory injury and may reduce postoperative complications in people with LRTI requiring operative surgery.</P>
<P>Any benefit from HBOT for the treatment of ORN is not reflected in the results of <LINK REF="STD-Annane-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2004</LINK>. There are several reasons why this might be so. First, this trial did not test the usual treatment regimen employed for the management of ORN and may not therefore be directly comparable with the other trials in this review. Case series data from the 1980s suggest that HBOT in isolation is not associated with a high resolution rate for established ORN and most centres now employ a combination of operative therapy, antibiotics and HBOT, as described by Marx (the Wilford Hall Protocol) (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1983</LINK>). One automatic definition of poor outcome for <LINK REF="STD-Annane-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2004</LINK> was the requirement for operative therapy in cases presenting with less-extensive disease, whether or not full recovery was eventually achieved. However, these cases would be reported as successes in the other included trials. Second, 66 of the 134 (49%) participants presenting with ORN during the study period were ineligible for inclusion, making generalisation of the findings of this trial to more advanced cases of ORN (such as those presented in <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marx-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Marx 1999b</LINK>) problematic. The first author has subsequently confirmed that "...one cannot use the findings of our study to decide the optimal treatment of severe forms of mandibular necrosis" (personal communication, April 2008). Third, of the 50 participants in this trial that did not have a good outcome at one year, 34 were described as experiencing previous treatment failure, which may have biased the result against superiority for either group. Finally, this trial was stopped (according to pre-defined rules) with only 68 participants included and before a statistically significant result had been achieved. Any of these factors may have influenced the outcome of this trial. It is also possible that advances in care have taken place over time, such that HBOT no longer carries a therapeutic benefit.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:21:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is some evidence of moderate quality that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves outcome in late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) affecting bone and soft tissues of the head and neck, for radiation proctitis and to prevent the development of osteoradionecrosis following tooth extraction in an irradiated field. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tissues, either peripheral or central. Thus, the application of HBOT to selected people and tissues may be justified. While the small number of studies, the modest numbers of participants, and the methodological and reporting inadequacies of some of the primary studies included in this review demand a cautious interpretation, the pathology of radiation injury suggests that other tissues are also likely to respond. Further research is required to establish the optimum participant selection and timing of any such therapy. An economic evaluation should also be undertaken.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:21:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is a strong case for further large randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit from the administration of HBOT for people with LRTI. Specifically, more information is required on the subset of disease severity and tissue type affected that is most likely to benefit from this therapy, the time for which we can expect any benefits to persist and the oxygen dose most appropriate. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:</P>
<OL>
<LI>appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences generated by this review;</LI>
<LI>careful definition and selection of target participants;</LI>
<LI>appropriate oxygen dose per treatment session (pressure and time);</LI>
<LI>appropriate supportive therapy to which HBOT would be an adjunct;</LI>
<LI>use of an effective sham therapy;</LI>
<LI>effective and explicit blinding of outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>appropriate outcome measures including all those listed in this review;</LI>
<LI>careful elucidation of any adverse events;</LI>
<LI>the cost-utility of the therapy.</LI>
