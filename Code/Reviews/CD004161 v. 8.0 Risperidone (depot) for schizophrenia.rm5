<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Risperidone is a newer antipsychotic drug that was the first available as a long-lasting injection (a depot injection). The review examines the clinical effects of depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). People can also become withdrawn, socially isolated, tired and apathetic. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, spasms and tiredness. These side effects often mean that people stop taking their medication (non- compliance), which may lead to relapse.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review was updated in 2015 and includes 12 studies with 5723 people who received risperidone depot or a range of other treatments (placebo, general oral antipsychotics, oral risperidone, oral quetiapine, oral aripiprazole, oral olanzapine, atypical/newer depot antipsychotics, older depot antipsychotics).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>It is difficult to know from the results of this review if depot risperidone is any more effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia than placebo or other treatments. For people who are happy to take oral medication, depot risperidone is about equal to oral risperidone. People on oral risperidone may continue to benefit if treated with depot risperidone, without the need to take tablets. However, in high doses, depot risperidone can have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, uncontrollable shaking, spasms and tremors. Depot risperidone may bring this new antipsychotic to people who stop taking their tablets, so helping reduce relapse and with little increased risk of side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence presented is, in the main, low and at best moderate. There is the need for large, long-term and well reported trials on depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. Depot injections are often used on people who refuse treatment. Such people are difficult to include in studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-24 15:13:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants were randomised to the following comparison treatments:</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus placebo </I>
</P>
<P>Outcomes of relapse and improvement in mental state were neither measured or reported. In terms of other primary outcomes, more people receiving placebo left the study early by 12 weeks (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.74 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), experienced severe adverse events in short term (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.59 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). There was however, no difference in levels of weight gain between groups (1 RCT, n=400, RR 2.11 95% CI 0.48 to 9.18, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus general oral antipsychotics </I>
</P>
<P>The outcome of improvement in mental state was not presented due to high levels of attrition, nor were levels of severe adverse events explicitly reported. Most primary outcomes of interest showed no difference between treatment groups. However, more people receiving depot risperidone experienced nervous system disorders (long-term:1 RCT, n=369, RR 1.34 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58, <I>very-low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus oral risperidone</I>
</P>
<P>Data for relapse and severe adverse events were not reported. All outcomes of interest were rated as <I>moderate quality evidence</I>. Main results showed no differences between treatment groups with equivocal data for change in mental state, numbers leaving the study early, any extrapyramidal symptoms, weight increase and prolactin-related adverse events.</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus oral quetiapine </I>
</P>
<P>Relapse rates and improvement in mental state were not reported. Fewer people receiving risperidone depot left the study early (long-term: 1 RCT, n=666, RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Experience of serious adverse events was similar between groups (<I>low quality evidence</I>), but more people receiving depot risperidone experienced EPS (1 RCT, n=666, RR 1.83 95% CI 1.07 to 3.15, <I>low quality evidence</I>), had greater weight gain (1 RCT, n=666, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.25 to 2.25, <I>low quality evidence</I>) and more prolactin-related adverse events (1 RCT, n=666, RR 3.07 95% CI 1.13 to 8.36<I>, very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus oral aripiprazole</I>
</P>
<P>Relapse rates, mental state using PANSS, leaving the study early, serious adverse events and weight increase were similar between groups. However more people receiving depot risperidone experienced prolactin-related adverse events compared to those receiving oral aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=729, RR 9.91 95% CI 2.78 to 35.29, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus oral olanzapine</I>
</P>
<P>Relapse rates were not reported in any of the included studies for this comparison. Improvement in mental state using PANSS and instances of severe adverse events were similar between groups. More people receiving depot risperidone left the study early than those receiving oral olanzapine (1 RCT, n=618, RR 1.32 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58, <I>low quality evidence</I>) with those receiving risperidone depot also experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms (1 RCT, n=547, RR 1.67 95% CI 1.19 to 2.36, <I>low quality evidence</I>). However, more people receiving oral olanzapine experienced weight increase (1 RCT, n=547, RR 0.56 95% CI 0.42 to 0.75, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus atypical depot antipsychotics (specifically paliperidone palmitate)</I>
</P>
<P>Relapse rates were not reported and rates of response using PANSS, weight increase, prolactin-related adverse events and glucose-related adverse events were similar between groups. Fewer people left the study early due to lack of efficacy from the risperidone depot group (long term: 1 RCT, n=749, RR 0.60 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81, <I>low quality evidence</I>), but more people receiving depot risperidone required use of EPS-medication (2 RCTs, n=1666, RR 1.46 95% CI 1.18 to 1.8, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Risperidone depot versus typical depot antipsychotics</I>
</P>
<P>Outcomes of relapse, severe adverse events or movement disorders were not reported. Outcomes relating to improvement in mental state demonstrated no difference between groups (<I>low quality evidence</I>). However, more people receiving depot risperidone compared to other typical depots left the study early (long-term:1 RCT, n=62, RR 3.05 95% CI 1.12 to 8.31, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-25 15:37:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second-generation antipsychotic to people who do not reliably adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benefit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-24 14:44:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a major, often chronic, psychiatric disease that close to seven people in every 1000 will be affected by at some point during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2008</LINK>). Antipsychotic drugs are effective for treating acute episodes and for preventing relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1986</LINK>). These drugs are usually given orally, but compliance is poor and ranges from 20% to 89% with an average of 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1986</LINK>). This means that, on average, half the patients treated with these drugs will not comply with prescribed medication. This is probably due to a combination of various factors such as the erosion of insight that accompanies psychotic illnesses, adverse effects and human nature.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-24 15:04:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-acting depot antipsychotics, given by injection into the muscle, should be helpful in increasing compliance with medication. In studies comparing one depot with another, attrition rates are markedly lower than in studies comparing oral preparations, but in trials comparing an oral with a depot preparation, there are no differences in the attrition rates between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2001</LINK>). This is likely to be due to a limitation in the design of the relevant studies, as people participating in randomised trials are more likely to be compliant. This is an area where 'real world' or 'pragmatic' randomised trials are indicated.</P>
<P>The newer generation of antipsychotics, often called atypical, seem to cause less of the movement disorders associated with older drugs. This group of compounds may be equally clinically effective (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1997</LINK>), and be more acceptable to people with schizophrenia, than older drugs such as haloperidol (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marder-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>) although this is disputed (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>). Atypical drugs have gained popularity amongst clinicians but, along with their cost, a lack of a depot preparation has been cited as a significant obstacle to their frequent use (<LINK REF="REF-Sarfati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarfati 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic, first made available for the care of those with schizophrenia in 1986. Since then clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety and studies have indicated that it may be superior to older drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 1994</LINK>). When oral risperidone is compared with haloperidol, it appears to have marginal benefits in terms of clinical improvement and is less likely to cause movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>). Risperidone is the first newer drug to be available in a long-acting injection formulation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-24 14:44:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risperidone is one of the new or second-generation "atypical" antipsychotics, developed in the late 1980s. It is known to block dopamine D2 and 5HT2 (serotonin) receptors in the brain, with a high ratio of 5HT2 to D2 blockade. It also blocks alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptors, H1 receptors and has no effect on beta adrenoceptors, muscarinic cholinoceptors or peptidergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The depot formulation of risperidone has unmodified risperidone encapsulated in biodegradable polymer microspheres, which are then suspended in an aqueous solution. Once the microspheres are injected into the muscle, the polymers begin to degrade and the drug is released at a set rate. This takes place over the course of several weeks, with the highest plasma concentration occurring approximately one month after injection (<LINK REF="REF-Ramstack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramstack 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-24 14:44:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In terms of the costs of schizophrenia, this was estimated at about £6.7 billion in England in 2004/05, of which the direct costs were £2 million while the indirect costs accounted for the rest (<LINK REF="REF-Mangalore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangalore 2007</LINK>). The cost of risperidone (depot) itself is expensive compared to other typical antipsychotics, at £142.76 for a 50 mg vial. The maximum monthly dose of risperidone (depot) is 100 mg per month, which costs £285.52 per month (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). These newer, atypical antipsychotics in comparison are more expensive than typical antipsychotics, with olanzapine available at £13.11 for 28 x 5 mg tablets, and clozapine (Clozaril) at £21.56 for 28 x 100 mg tablets.</P>
<P>It is important to complement the clinical effectiveness of risperidone (depot) with its cost-effectiveness. Davies et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2007</LINK>) conducted a study on cost-effectiveness of first-generation antipsychotics (i.e. flupentixol, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine) and the second-generation antipsychotics (i.e. risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpiride). The study findings argue that there is no evidence to suggest that atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics are more cost-effective than typical (first-generation) antipsychotics.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING>
<P>For this update PH, and TN extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, SS independently extracted data from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. Again, any disagreement was discussed, decisions documented and, if necessary, authors of studies contacted for clarification. With any remaining problems, we contacted editorial team (<LINK REF="REF-CEA" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEA</LINK>) to help clarify issues and these final decisions were documented. Data presented only in graphs and figures were extracted whenever possible, but included only if two review authors independently had the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary.</P>
<P>For the economic analysis had VF and SS found Type A and B studies (see <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1511171520444779582034426896480&amp;format=REVMAN#CRIT_STUDIES">Types of studies</A>), they would have investigated whether appraisal had already been undertaken by <A HREF="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/homepage.asp">NHS EED</A> using their search tool derived for this purpose. If appraisal had not been undertaken, VF and SS would have applied the <A HREF="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/homepage.asp">NHS EED</A> tool to the data. In this current review, should there only be Type C studies available, we would extract outcome data directly from the already-included effectiveness studies. We recognise that much information would be lacking to get results that are both valid and reliable.</P>

<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly, and we noted in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> whether or not this was the case.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to relevant data before inclusion:<BR/>a) standard deviations (SDs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;<BR/>b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean, as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>);<BR/>c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score.<BR/>
<BR/>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. However, skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large, we therefore, entered skewed endpoint data from studies with over 200 participants into syntheses.When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not and we entered skewed change data into analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for risperidone depot. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not un-improved'), we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI)*. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios (ORs) and that ORs tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). We did not calculate the Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/H). The NNT/H statistic with its CIs is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=10522344846093567587120911135455&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Hutton-2009">Hutton 2009</A>).

<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, if we had included cross-over trials, we planned only to use the data from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses, except for the outcomes of leaving the study early and adverse events. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias. This was the case for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50%, and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - were used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either a P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we can calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. However, we did not impute any data in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data had been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 70% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We planned not to use funnel plots for outcomes where there were less than 10studies in each analysis, or where all studies were of similar sizes. If funnel plots had been possible, we planned to seek statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-02-24 14:44:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the random-effects model for all analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Study design</HEADING>
<P>All 12 included studies were randomised and eight featured some form of blinding - ranging from blinding of raters in otherwise open-label studies to blinding of all participants and investigators; four studies were expressly or implied as 'open-label' but employed blinded raters (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Covell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>). Study duration also varied considerably; three studies were short term at 12 to 13 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Covell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Covell 2012</LINK> was medium term, while seven followed up participants for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>).

The majority of studies took place in the community, and were well-represented internationally, with studies conducted in Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>) and the remaining as multi-centre studies, conducted within the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Covell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Covell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>), China (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>), Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK>); and international multi-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of n = 5723 participants who received the intervention were included, with the majority of studies providing data as to male and female participants; a total of n = 3140 male and n = 2112 female participants were included, with a mean age of around 40 years. All studies used the Diagnostic and Statistical Mannual version 1V (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) to define schizophrenia; so for at least six continuous months a participant must have shown some evidence of schizophrenia, and for at least one month must have shown at least two symptoms of frank psychosis. These symptoms would have included delusions, hallucinations, incoherent speech, disorganised or catatonic behaviour, or flat affect. To meet DSM IV criteria, the symptoms must be disabling in such a way that social and occupational functioning is impaired; these symptoms should not be the direct result of a physical disorder or of substance misuse. Most studies randomised people who had been experiencing schizophrenia for some years; often specifying that they need to have had schizophrenia for at least one year before diagnosis.</P>
<P>Further criteria for selecting participants varied from study to study, depending on exactly what was being investigated, but general exclusion criteria were reasonably consistent; people with a history of violence to themselves or others, or of recent suicide attempts were not permitted to take part. Nor were those with active DSM-IV diagnosed substance dependence or general ill health, including serious psychiatric problems other than schizophrenia. Tolerance to risperidone was an important factor that all studies addressed; most potential participants underwent a screening period at the start of their trial to establish that they could tolerate risperidone; this was sometimes waived if they had already demonstrated this (i.e. they were currently treated with the drug).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The prescribing of depot risperidone was consistent across the board; 25, 37.5 and 50 mg injections every two weeks were the most common dosages, with participants typically initiated on 25 mg/two weeks, which was then stepped up in 12.5 mg increments if their symptoms worsened. Three earlier studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK>) included depot risperidone up to 75 mg, but such high doses were not used by the most recent studies. Because it can take several weeks for therapeutic plasma levels of the drug to build-up, oral supplementation, either with oral risperidone or the participant's previous oral antipsychotic, was typically used for the initial two to four weeks.</P>
<P>The trials involving oral antipsychotics either compared depot risperidone versus another specific single antipsychotic or to more than one antipsychotic. Only one study compared depot risperidone with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>). Of the studies comparing depot risperidone with another single antipsychotic, two used oral risperidone at 2 mg to 6 mg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>); one study investigated5 mg to 20 mg/day oral olanzapine (<LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK>), and one compared depot risperidone against 5 mg to 30 mg/day oral aripiprazole (<LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Covell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Covell 2012</LINK> compared either haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine (no doses prescribed, but used at 'clinician's judgement'; <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> was mainly concerned with quetiapine at up to 750 mg/day, but also featured a smaller aripiprazole arm of 10 mg to 30 mg per day. The remaining three studies randomised patients to receive depot risperidone or to remain on their current oral antipsychotic; in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>, only second-generation "atypical" drugs were used, specifically risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK> provides no details of which drugs were used.</P>
<P>Paliperidone palmitate (PP) is the active metabolite of risperidone, but features a different administration schedule and dosages to depot risperidone; PP doses can be given either in milligrams (mg), for the overall volume injected, or in milligram equivalents (mg eq), which refers to the fraction of the drug that is actually pharmacologically active. So 39 mg of PP is given as 25 mg eq, 78 mg is 50 mg eq, etc. The injection schedule of this drug only requires monthly intra-muscular injections to maintain therapeutic levels and oral supplementation is not needed, so in the non open-label PP studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>) oral placebo and bi-weekly placebo injections were used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was utilised in some manner by the majority of the included studies, with data provided either as mean (SD or SE) endpoint or change scores, or as percentages of participants who were either not ill or mildly ill. Much data were unusable due to the high level of attrition in some studies and inconsistent reporting in others. Another rating scale used to assess global state was the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS) scale.</P>
<P>Other outcomes that give an impression of the general condition of somebody with schizophrenia, such as levels of relapse and remission, the proportion of participants who needed concomitant benzodiazepine and how long they were able to stay on the study drug are also included here.</P>
<P>Where relapse was included as an outcome, the investigators typically used the criteria for relapse in <LINK REF="REF-Csernansky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Csernansky 2002</LINK>. Briefly, these consist of worsening of psychiatric condition (i.e. requiring hospitalisation or increased care), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) or CGI scores that are markedly higher than the baseline, self-harm or suicidal/homicidal ideation, discontinuing the study drug due to ineffectiveness, requiring additional antipsychotic medications or non protocol doses of the study drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>PANSS was the key mental state assessment scale; each study reported changes in PANSS total scores, with some also including the subscales and factor scores. Unfortunately, as with CGI, high attrition prevented us from including PANSS scores from every study in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.3 General functioning</HEADING>
<P>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK> and data for the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale were available from <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.4 Service utilisation</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK> centred around the use of medical and psychiatric health services; the data for these outcomes were obtained through the VA health services, which potentially side-steps the issue of low follow-up interview rates as these data would be available for participants who missed interviews but nonetheless remained a part of the study. Data on in-patient and out-patient care were available, and include rates of hospitalisation and mean (SD) numbers of visits to individual or group psychiatry sessions, as well as other psychiatric and general healthcare services.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.5 Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>It is disappointing that more studies did not include measures to assess quality of life (QoL) on the trial drugs. Several studies did make use of various QoL questionnaires, but high attrition means that the results could not be used. The one exception to this is in <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>, which made use of the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.6 Economic outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Very few studies involved any assessment of the economic outcomes associated with treatment with depot risperidone. The two exceptions are <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> which presented these outcomes in papers published separately to the main study report. Lack of standard deviations and the format in which some of these outcomes were presented makes it difficult to use them in a quantitative analysis, but we have commented on the key findings in a qualitative manner.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.7 Satisfaction with treatment</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial addressed this in a manner that did not fall foul of the 50% attrition limit; <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK> recorded patient satisfaction with their current treatment using a five-point scale, very good to poor. However, no evidence to validate this method was presented, consequently we decided not to include the data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.8 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported the number of participants leaving the study early from both groups, and provided a breakdown of the main reasons given for doing so.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.9 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were reported by all of the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> reported overall rates of adverse events in both groups, and the numbers withdrawing from the study as a result of side effects. No details were given regarding the nature of these adverse events or how they were recorded. The abstracts available for this review state that body weight was measured and laboratory tests were undertaken. The reports state that there were no differences between oral and depot groups, but present no numbers. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> also used the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), but again, no numerical data were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> reported rates of individual adverse events spontaneously reported by participants, and reported these for all people in the study, not just those who completed the trial. Median ESRS scores were also reported for each group at baseline and change at endpoint. Pain and swelling at injection sites rated by investigators and patients were also reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK> gave rates of adverse events that occurred in &gt;10% of participants in either group, as well as serious, prolactin- and glucose-related events. The results of laboratory tests for levels of prolactin, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were also provided. Adverse events occurring in more than 5% of participants were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>; there was no discussion of how these events were identified or reported. They were also grouped under quite general subheadings, so "nervous system disorders" comprises all extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), as well as the likes of headache, somnolence and dizziness.</P>

<P>
<I>5.1.1 Global functioning. Clinical Global Impression - CGI </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>
<I>5.1.2 Global Assessement of Functioning - GAF</I> (DSM-IV-TR, <LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>The GAF rating scale is presented in DSM-IV as a quick method for assessing psychological, social and occupational function to give an impression of an individual's overall level of functioning relating to their mental health. Scoring is from zero to 100. Very high scores indicate absent or minimal symptoms that have little effect on functioning, very low scores (below 20) indicate a serious danger that somebody will hurt themselves or others.</P>
<P>
<I>5.1.3 Schedule for Deficit Syndrome - SDS</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 1989</LINK>)</P>
<P>This tool is used to evaluate the presence of negative or deficit-related symptoms, SDS regards these as flattened affect, poverty of speech, diminished emotional range, curbing of interest and diminished sense of purpose. If a person with schizophrenia has had two or more of the listed symptoms for 12 months, and they were not caused by other factors such as substance dependence or depression, then they are diagnosed with deficit syndrome. Severity is rated from zero to four, higher scores are worse, for each criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>
<I>5.2.1 Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>)<BR/>This scale was developed to evaluate the positive, negative and general symptoms in schizophrenia. The PANSS has 30 items, and each item can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from one (absent) to seven (extreme). This scale is divided into three subscales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.3 General functioning</HEADING>
<P>
<I>5.3.1 Personal and Social Performance Scale - PSP</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Nafees-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nafees 2012</LINK>)</P>
<P>The PSP scale measures an individual's functioning within society and is assessed through a 10 to 15 minute structured interview looking at four domains (socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviours). An overall score between zero and 100 is derived from the individual factor scores; a higher score indicates better personal and social functioning.</P>

<I>5.4.1 Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey - SF-36 </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1992</LINK>)</P>
<P>SF-36 rates health-related quality of life in eight main components (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, social function and vitality), each scored from zero to 100, higher scores are better.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.5 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the following scales were used by the study investigators to obtain dichotomised results relating to specific adverse effects - the data and analysis section of this review presents predominantly dichotomised data relating to adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<I>5.5.1 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This scale consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items) and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>
<I>5.5.2 Barnes Akathisia Scale - BARS </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)</P>
<P>This rating scale assesses drug-induced akathisia (restlessness or the urge to move). Individuals are rated on their observable level of restlessness while sitting (objective), their awareness of the urge to move and the distress, if any, that this causes (subjective) and on a global assessment. Higher scores indicate more severe akathisia.</P>
<P>
<I>5.5.3 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale - AIMS</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Munetz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munetz 1988</LINK>)</P>
<P>This 12-item scale is used to assess the severity of dyskinesia in an individual. Items such as movement of the jaw or the extremities are rated on a scale from zero (none) to four (severe) and combined to give a total score.</P>
<P>
<I>5.5.4 The Udvalg for Kliniske Undersgelser side effects rating scale - UKU</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerd-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerd 1987</LINK>)</P>
<P>The UKU is a tool for recording side effects of neuroleptic treatment in a standardised manner, items are scored from zero, absent or normal, to three, severe.</P>
<P>
<I>5.5.5 Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale - ASEX (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-McGahuey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGahuey 2000</LINK>
<I>)</I>
</P>
<P>The ASEX scale is a five-item rating scale that quantifies sexual experiences (including drive/ arousal/ satisfaction from or ability to reach orgasm) with total scores ranging from five to 30, with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction</P>

<P>All studies were randomised, but there was extreme inconsistency in how well the methods used were reported. Most studies also did not describe how allocation concealment was achieved. At one end of the spectrum, it is simply stated that participants were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>) with no further details, with other studies giving more details on the stratification factors used, e.g. site, PANSS score, previous antipsychotic medication (<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>). While the implication is that all studies used computer-generated schemes to randomise participants, this is only explicitly stated in a handful of cases. Descriptions of allocation concealment are neglected by most of the included studies, but methods were similar amongst studies that provide them. Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) were used by <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>; this is a system whereby the investigator phones a number, enters the patient details and receives a medication allocation based on the randomisation algorithm. <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK> set the benchmark for minimising the risk of allocation bias, with a description of the randomisation algorithm and the use of an IVRS.</P>

<P>The included studies utilised a number of types of blinding, each resulting in different amounts of risk for performance and detection bias.</P>
<P>The studies with the least risk were often described as "double blind"; they took measures to ensure that neither the participants nor the investigators monitoring them and rating outcomes would know which treatment a person was actually taking. The study of depot risperidone versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>) and one of those involving oral antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>) used placebo injections that were the same volume as those containing the study drug. Two of the paliperidone palmitate (PP) studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK>) utilised placebos in the PP group so that both groups took the same number of tablets and had the same number of injections. Participants were also precluded from seeing the syringe when they received the injection, as the two drugs were different in appearance. The techniques used for blinding in these studies were of very high quality and present little risk of the blind being broken.</P>
<P>All other studies have a significantly higher risk of performance bias as the allocation of interventions was not blinded; this was somewhat mitigated against in <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>, all of which used blinded raters to perform outcome assessments, often via video conference.</P>

<P>There is little risk of attrition bias emerging from incomplete outcome data in most studies. Drop-out rates are uniformly reported and are normally accompanied by a breakdown of the main reasons for leaving the study early. Overall attrition is greater than 50% in some studies; where this is the case we have not used the data from affected outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>, the attrition rate was not simply explained; it was stated that 69.8% of the oral treatment group and 63.6% of the depot risperidone group completed the study, but what this actually means is never made explicitly clear. Indeed, the overall completion rate does not tally with the follow-up interview rates, which are given as 60% at 12 months, 46% at 18 months and only 29% of participants completing the full two years of follow-up interviews, with there being no difference between follow-up rates across the two intervention groups. The implication is that patients could remain in the study and have their health service use available for analysis despite no longer taking part in the follow-up interviews to assess secondary outcome measures. Generally, across studies, attrition was high, and therefore rated at a 'high' risk of bias - three studies in particular reported losses of greater than 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Relapse</HEADING>
<P>No direct evidence exists regarding the risk of relapse for risperidone depot versus placebo. The closest available data relate to change in mental state, which is discussed below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>Clinically significant improvement in the context of <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> was defined as being a 20% improvement in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score, but evidence pertaining to this cannot be used in this analysis as more than half of the data were assumed by the authors.To indirectly assess clinically significant changes in mental state, it may possible to look at the incidence of related adverse events; depot risperidone did result in significantly decreased reports of agitation and psychosis, the latter especially could be indicative of a clinical differences. Using adverse events from this study in this way is hampered by the fact that they were only recorded when spontaneously reported by a participant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>Four hundred people were randomised and 370 participants had at least one injection and one post-baseline assessment. There was no difference between depot risperidone and placebo group for the outcome of leaving the study before one injection (n = 400, RR 1.30 CI 0.55 to 3.08). Fifty-six per cent of people did not complete the three-month study (68% in the placebo group, 52% in the depot groups). The attrition rate was higher for those allocated placebo compared with people allocated risperidone depot. There did not seem to be any dose-related effects, although when the reason for leaving was lack of efficacy, there seemed to be some differences. Higher doses of risperidone depot resulted in slightly less attrition. People randomised to the placebo were more likely to leave the study early than those in the depot risperidone group, and the level of attrition for any reason did not differ between the three doses of risperidone depot. The numbers of people leaving early due to lack of efficacy may be dose-related; half as many people gave it as their reason in the 75 mg group compared to the 25 mg group. This suggests that there were people for whom higher doses of depot risperidone are required to produce a therapeutic effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 Severe adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Severe adverse events were common in <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, occurring in 13% to 23% of participants and significantly more often in the placebo group. The authors define a severe adverse event as anything that resulted in death or was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect. No details are given about specific severe adverse events that were reported in each group; this raises the serious possibility that very different events have been bundled together. This in turn could conceal evidence regarding important effects of using depot risperidone, but there is no way to tell with the data reported as they are.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.5 Adverse events related to movement disorder, weight gain, prolactin levels and glucose metabolism</HEADING>
<P>Rates of movement disorder did not differ between depot risperidone and the placebo; the data did show a trend towards more extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with increasing doses of depot risperidone, but even at the 75 mg dose of risperidone, this fell short of statistical significance (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). More studies, with larger sample sizes, would probably produce a significant result, but it is unlikely that such studies will ever be conducted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>Data relating directly to mental state (such as PANSS scores) are not useable due to the high levels of attrition in both <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK>.

Neither of these outcomes differed significantly between the treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference in the overall rates of study attrition when comparing risperidone depot with general oral antipsychotics, however the general trend was towards risperidone depot group participants being more likely to leave, with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval only just falling to the left of the line of no effect (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was no difference between risperidone depot and general oral antipsychotics for adverse events related to weight gain, prolactin or glucose metabolism.

<P>Leaving the study early did not occur any more in one treatment arm over the other. The attrition rate in <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2006</LINK> was very low, with only one participant from the risperidone depot group and none from the oral group leaving early; this is probably due to its setting being an inpatient psychiatric unit, where the constant presence of various healthcare professionals would ensure that patients adhered to their prescribed medication. Attrition in <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>, a study taking place in the community, was predictably higher.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.5 Adverse events related to movement disorder, weight gain, prolactin levels and glucose metabolism</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between depot and oral risperidone regarding the number experiencing any EPS, which occurred in 6.5% to 6.8% of all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>. Tardive dyskinesia was reported four times in the depot group of <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> and not at all in the oral group, but this was not quite enough to establish a statistical difference between the two.</P>
<P>Prolactin-related adverse events were rare, occurring in 1.2% to 2.5% of participants; with between zero and two people in each group experiencing each of: sexual dysfunction and impotence, galactorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea. The number of participants who experienced a significant amount of weight gain is not known, but there was a small mean increase of 0.5 kg in the depot group and 0.3 kg in the oral group.</P>

<P>Time to relapse was measured as a primary outcome by <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>, but the high level of attrition in the study made most of the data unsuitable for inclusion in our analysis. One outcome that can be included is the number of participants leaving the study early for the specific reason of relapse; individuals in the oral quetiapine group were 46% more likely to leave the study due to relapse than the risperidone depot group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.4 Severe adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between the two interventions for the rate at which severe adverse events were reported, and the overall rate of severe adverse events in <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> appears broadly congruent with the other included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.5 Adverse events related to movement disorder, weight gain, prolactin levels and glucose metabolism</HEADING>
<P>Risperidone depot caused more EPS than oral quetiapine among the study population, with ~10% of the risperidone group reporting any EPS symptom compared to 5.6% of the quetiapine group. The specific symptoms of tremor and "parkinsonism" were more common with risperidone depot.</P>
<P>Similar numbers of people in both groups experienced weight gain through the study period, but the mean (SD) increase in weight appears to be greater for risperidone depot.</P>
<P>Significantly more prolactin-related problems occurred in those taking depot risperidone. The rate of hyperprolactinaemia was almost nine times greater than the quetiapine group, and risperidone group members were three times more likely to experience side effects related to prolactin.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK> showed no difference between the two interventions, with just under half of each group relapsing during the study period. These data cannot be compared directly to the relapse data from <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> due to the attrition level of that study, but the number of individuals leaving the study early due to relapse in <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> did trend towards favouring risperidone depot for relapse prevention, the very small size of the aripiprazole arm in this study prevents this outcome from reaching statistical significance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>Data relating to PANSS responder rates were not available or usable for either study, but <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK> reported that the overall change in PANSS total score through the study period was virtually the same for both groups, with a mean reduction of around 11 points.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity relating to this outcome. Meta-analysis shows no difference between risperidone depot and oral aripiprazole when leaving the study early for any reason, but the participants in each study differed markedly. Drop-out rates in <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK> were very similar (n = 349 RR 1.03 [0.74, 1.43]), with around 30% attrition overall, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>, those in the aripiprazole group were significantly more likely to leave (n = 384 RR 0.70 [0.58, 0.84]), with 78% dropping out of that group.

<P>Rates of movement disorder did not differ significantly overall between the risperidone depot and oral aripiprazole groups, but this probably does not tell the whole story. Risperidone depot was associated with movement disorder in a greater proportion of participants than aripiprazole in <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>, but the substantial disparity in the size of the two analysis sets prevents those results from achieving statistical significance (n = 384 RR 2.33 [0.58, 9.35]). There were also differences between the studies, with substantially more participants in both groups reporting movement disorder in <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>. It is not clear why this is so; whether it is due to methodological differences in the way such events were defined and the data collected, differences in the make up of the study population and their susceptibility to EPS effects or some other factors.</P>
<P>Glucose-related events were reported by 9% to 10% of those in <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>, with no difference between the groups. Weight gain was also broadly similar for both interventions, but prolactin-related adverse events were much more common with risperidone depot and there were no incidences of hyperprolactinaemia with aripiprazole</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>There is some discrepancy between the stated levels of study attrition (i.e. the completion rate) and the number of participants for whom outcome data are available up to the end of the study period. For depot risperidone, average endpoint PANSS scores are provided for 155 participants, with last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis used. However, the number of participants for whom the mean PANSS score change at 12 months (the end of the study) is given was only 116. We are not certain how the difference between the number of participants who completed the study from this group (n = 160) and the number for whom data are available at 12 months (n = 116) can be so great.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>Participants taking risperidone depot had a significantly increased risk of leaving the study early; about half of the risperidone depot group compared to a third of the olanzapine arm. Much of this difference can be explained by the decision of the investigators to alter the protocol and exclude the 75 mg risperidone depot group after randomisation had taken place, resulting in 66 participants being excluded from the main analysis. If this is taken into account, the rates of participants leaving the study for other reasons, such as insufficient response, are similar for each intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.4 Severe adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Severe adverse events were reported at similar rates for both interventions, but what made a particular adverse event "severe" is not explained. Adverse events such as anxiety are reported as both general and severe adverse events Presumably the investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK> had some criteria to differentiate severe adverse events, but these are not explained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.5 Adverse events related to movement disorder, weight gain, prolactin levels and glucose metabolism</HEADING>
<P>Movement disorder was a common adverse event in both groups, but was significantly more common in those receiving risperidone depot, with around 25% experiencing it to some degree, compared to 15% of the olanzapine group. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the usage of anti-parkinsonian medications was greater in the depot risperidone group as well. Reporting of EPS was not clear in this study; the overall percentage of participants experiencing EPS was given, but it is difficult to see how these data correspond to those in a table which breaks down EPS into separate symptoms, e.g. hyperkinesia, tardive dyskinesia, tremor, etc. In particular, "Extrapyramidal disorder" is listed as a specific outcome in this table, but was apparently only reported by 8% of the risperidone depot group and 4% of the olanzapine group. There is no way to discern precisely what this item encompasses, nor what differentiates it from the overall rate of EPS. We have contacted the study authors for clarification on this point, but have yet to receive a response.</P>
<P>Olanzapine caused significantly more weight gain than risperidone depot in the study population; more than 1/3 of participants taking olanzapine are reported to have experienced weight gain greater than 7% of their bodyweight (mean weight gain overall of 4.0 kg), compared to a 1/5 of the risperidone group (mean increase of 1.7 kg overall).</P>
<P>Prolactin-related adverse events were rare and did not differ between the interventions; there were two instances of impotence or ejaculation failure in each arm, and similarly low levels of galactorrhoea. One new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made in each group during the study period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">7. Risperidone depot versus all oral antipsychotics (primary outcomes)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.1 Relapse</HEADING>
<P>Data from the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK>) that measured relapse directly suggest that it occurs at the same rate when depot risperidone treatment is compared to aripiprazole or a variety of second-generation antipsychotics. When compared to quetiapine, however, depot risperidone treatment leads to only half as many cases of relapse. The precise methods used to define this outcome vary between <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK>, but they are similar enough in appearance (factors such as hospitalisation, PANSS and CGI change being common between the two) that we can be confident they are measuring the same thing. <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK> is more problematic, as no definition of relapse is given; such methodological details are probably too much to be asking of a single poster and an abstract, but if a full report becomes available it will be important to confirm this.</P>
<P>The quality of some of this evidence is also questionable; <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2012_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2012*</LINK> in particular had a high risk of bias due to their nature as open-label studies with no evidence of rater blinding. One perhaps very serious methodological weakness of <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> that may have had an impact on the effect size reported was that follow-up methods differed between intervention groups. Depot risperidone participants attended physical appointments to receive their medication and undergo assessment of certain outcomes every two weeks, whereas those in the oral quetiapine and aripiprazole groups received phone calls for the same purpose. The depot group participants therefore spent more time with healthcare professionals during the course of the study; even if the exact same questions were asked at in-person and telephone check-ups, seeing a patient in the flesh may have made it easier to detect clinical deterioration and adjust doses of concomitant medications and the study drug before a slight deterioration has time to snowball into a full relapse.</P>
<P>The regular attention that comes with being prescribed depot rather than oral antipsychotics may be an important aspect of the intervention, but in a randomised clinical trial (RCT) of two drugs there is a case for limiting potential confounders so that the only effect measured is that of the drugs, not that of the drugs plus the intensity of care provided. More studies are needed that address the issue of relapse directly; a RCT comparing relapse and hospitalisation rates between depot and oral risperidone is of particular importance. Using only the currently available evidence comparing depot risperidone with oral quetiapine, it is not possible to tell whether the significant difference in relapse rates is due mainly to the difference in administration methods or due to the different pharmacological properties of risperidone and quetiapine. If oral risperidone is as effective as the depot preparation at preventing relapse, then economic considerations may take on greater importance in prescribing decisions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>No comparisons with usable data from these studies give any direct indication as to how many participants achieved clinically significant improvements in mental state, but data regarding average mental state scores are available. Risperidone depot is not significantly different from oral risperidone, olanzapine or aripiprazole in its effect on mental state, as measured through all domains of PANSS, with the average scores for participants in all study arms either improving or remaining largely the same (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>People randomised to risperidone depot were as likely to leave the study early as those assigned to aripiprazole (n = 723, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30), oral risperidone (n = 690, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.79), or any oral antipsychotic (n = 382, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.68). Compared to oral quetiapine and any new-generation oral antipsychotic, participants in the risperidone depot group were significantly less likely to leave the study early (n = 666, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95 and n = 77, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, respectively), and significantly more likely to drop out than participants randomised to olanzapine (n = 618, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.4 Severe adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There is great inconsistency in the reporting of serious adverse effects amongst these studies, which makes any comparisons problematic. When severe effects were reported there were no differences in the rates at which they occurred when comparing depot risperidone to quetiapine, aripiprazole or olanzapine. It is not clear, though, whether the outcome of severe adverse effects if comparable between these studies; of the three trials, none provide a definition of what they consider to be a serious adverse event and the reporting of the specific events is often very vague. <LINK REF="STD-Keks-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Keks 2007</LINK> is the only study to explicitly list the severe adverse events that were reported by more than 2% of either group; of the other two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> only gives an overall rate and the rate of the most common serious adverse events (psychiatric symptoms), while <LINK REF="STD-MacFadden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MacFadden 2010</LINK> states that psychotic disorder and schizophrenia were the most common serious adverse events but gives no details on their precise incidence.</P>
<P>With severe adverse events reported in such a scattergun manner throughout these trials, it is impossible to perceive any trends or patterns of severe adverse events emerging for any of the interventions. A rare, but serious, side effect (or side effects) may occur consistently at a rate below the reporting threshold yet remain unreported in the literature.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7.5 Economic costs of treatment</HEADING>
<P>An analysis of Medical Resource Utilisation (MRU) using a small subset of relapsed participants from <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> determined that each individual cost their country's health service an average of &#8364;7592 in the three months following their relapse and that this figure was &#8364;1525 higher in people who required psychiatric hospitalisation during this time.</P>
<P>Drawing too many conclusions from these data are dangerous; this analysis is available only as a single abstract. As such, details on the methods used to produce these figures are sparse; of particular concern is that fact that <LINK REF="STD-Gaebel-2010_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gaebel 2010*</LINK> was spread out over 124 centres in 25 European countries. It is quite conceivable that there is significant heterogeneity in the health services of these countries that may affect how and where money is spent. The full version of the paper may be able to address this, but until then it is unclear exactly how applicable this evidence is.</P>
<P>Despite this, it is still clear that relapse, especially if it involves hospitalisation, is expensive. Using administrative data from the Veterans Administration (VA), the researchers in <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 2011</LINK> were able to determine the mean (SD) cost of in- and out-patient care, as well as medication costs, in each treatment group per quarter (three months) of follow-up). They found that the overall costs relating to service use for each group were similar, a result that seems congruent with the finding that there was no difference between groups in levels of post-randomisation hospitalisation or out-patient care. Medication costs, however, were substantially higher for depot risperidone. The study drug itself cost more than the control group's medication, but further to this, depot group participants also received nearly $500 of extra oral antipsychotics. They also required $357 more in concomitant medications, leading to approximately $1000 more per quarter being spent on each patient with no quantifiable difference in outcomes.</P>
<P>Based solely on these data, it is not possible to claim that depot risperidone is a cost-effective treatment option for schizophrenia. Generalising these results specifically in terms of absolute amounts spent may be an issue; the study they are based on was of a 90% male population of military veterans with unstable schizophrenia, whose needs could differ substantially from patients in other situations. There is also a reasonable risk that the unblinded nature of follow-up could have lead to clinical decisions (e.g. whether to hospitalise) being made differently depending on the intervention a person was using, leading to performance bias. However, the data regarding the price of depot risperidone compared to oral treatment are important.</P>
<P>In the future, we plan to undertake full economic analysis to complement the above findings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">8.2 Clinically significant improvement in mental state</HEADING>
<P>A clinically significant difference in mental state was considered to be a 30% or greater reduction in total PANSS score by the three studies. For <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>, however, the high level of overall study attrition (55% did not complete) combined with the use of LOCF data means that more than half of the data used to determine this outcome was based on assumptions. Synthesis of the data from <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> shows there is no difference between depot risperidone and paliperidone palmitate for the number of PANSS responders, though <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> did report a greater improvement in total PANSS (RR 3.30 CI 0.24 to 6.36) and positive symptom (P = 0.01, RR 1.80 CI 0.42 to 3.18, <LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>) scores for those receiving PP.</P>
<P>The PANSS responder rates reported by the two studies demonstrate a significant level of heterogeneity, with around 50% of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> compared to 70% to 78% in <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>, and it is not immediately apparent what has caused this difference. Their respective designs are very similar, with common treatment period duration, the same range of doses used for each intervention and the average final dose for each treatment was also similar (the mean (SD) final PP dose was 104.5 (30.51) mg eq in <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> and 115.8 (9.07) mg eq in <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK>, but this difference can probably be accounted for by the analysis set used to determine these figures. <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> gave the mean for the per protocol analysis set, while <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> gave it for the safety analysis set, which includes participants who left the study after only one dose who therefore would not have been titrated onto the higher doses yet). The two important differences are probably blinding and sample size; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> randomised 452 people and was open-label, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> had more than double the study population (n = 1220) and utilised a double-blind approach.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8.3 Leaving the study early for any reason</HEADING>
<P>Participants assigned to depot risperidone were overall less likely to leave the study early for any reason, but it is difficult to reason exactly why that is. It could be related to efficacy; data from mental and global state outcomes show that depot risperidone and PP are essentially equivalent in their effects, yet there was a (not quite statistically significant) trend towards PP group participants being more likely to cite lack of efficacy when leaving the study. As PP is a newer drug (albeit a derivative of risperidone), it is conceivable that the dosing guidelines are less well supported, or that people taking PP were less likely to be dosed appropriately than those allocated to depot risperidone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8.4 Severe adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Serious adverse events occurred at the same rate for depot risperidone and paliperidone palmitate, being reported by 10% to 13% of participants in all three studies. If the two-year long trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK>) is excluded from this analysis to leave only the shorter follow-up studies, the rate of serious adverse events goes down to below 5%, which suggests that serious adverse events may be more likely to occur after being on either of the study drugs for a prolonged period. <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK> also featured significantly more severe adverse events in the paliperidone palmitate group.</P>
<P>Differences in study design other than the length of follow-up are unlikely to account for the excess severe adverse events as all three studies shall very similar methodology, with the exception that <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-Pandina-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pandina 2011</LINK> are double-blind studies, while <LINK REF="STD-Li-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2011</LINK> is open-label. This finding is important because most people who are prescribed antipsychotics for schizophrenia are presumably expecting to take them for more than 13 weeks, so the short-term studies might not present an accurate representation of the risk.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 2011</LINK> also raises the possibility that while the two drugs may be similar in the short term, over time, the risk of serious adverse effects may be greater for PP; more long-term studies of depot risperidone and paliperidone palmitate are needed to assess this.</P>

These data showed no difference between the two groups at any point, but it is not possible to say anything about how many participants experienced a significant change in their mental state.

As the researchers themselves noted, this can probably be explained by the study design; being randomised to risperidone depot came with a requirement to switch their medication, whereas those in the typical depot group were allowed to stay on the antipsychotics they had already been taking.

<P>Naturalistic protocols more closely resemble real-life clinical practice, but very high attrition in some of these makes the results less useful.</P>
<P>The applicability of the evidence in this review to real-life practice may be somewhat hindered by the nature of the participants recruited to the included studies, more specifically the question of whether or not they really reflect the types of patients in the real world who would most benefit from taking depot antipsychotics over oral preparations.</P>
<P>Depot antipsychotics are intended for people that do not want, or are unable, to take daily oral drugs. If an individual has enough stability and insight in their day to day life to adhere to an oral regimen, then they probably would not gain any greater freedom from their symptoms through a depot. In the real world, depots are prescribed for patients for whom the severity of their illness prevents this level of stability and control, and who may benefit from having their medication delivered consistently in a manner that is "out of their hands", so to speak. The people recruited to most, if not all, of these studies did not appear to be that ill, with baseline PANSS total scores consistently in the 60 to 80 range and recruitment criteria that excluded those with substance abuse problems, a history of violent or suicidal behaviour or comorbid psychiatric problems. The results can only really speak for the effects of risperidone depot on patients for whom receiving their medication as bi-weekly injections or daily oral preparations may make very little difference to the amount of drug delivered to their system.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> features a very high level of attrition from the study, almost 70% in the placebo group and just over 50% in the active treatment group. The consequence of this is that the authors conclusion, that depot risperidone is significantly more efficacious than placebo for improving the symptoms of schizophrenia, is based mainly on assumptions. Using the evidence from this study alone, there is nothing to support the idea that depot risperidone is any better than placebo. Yet despite the problems with this study, which was included in the previously published version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hosalli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosalli 2003</LINK>), a decade later it is still the only randomised controlled trial that compares depot risperidone versus placebo. While the other results in this review demonstrate that depot risperidone is very likely as effective as other antipsychotics, it is worrying that these trials all took place in an environment where the superiority of depot risperidone was taken as read.</P>
<P>Adverse event reporting was inconsistent amongst the included studies; specifically there was no evidence that the criteria used to define "serious adverse events/effects" were the same from study to study.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Based on the evidence from the one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>), depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially at higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot, risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone as seen within the considerable limitations of the two relevant studies. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second-generation antipsychotic to people who do not adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benefit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>For reasonably well and stable people, it may mean they can avoid taking regular oral doses but adverse affects are not well reported. When given to more severely ill people, few benefits were demonstrated in the short term, although it may increase compliance with injections compared with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders.</P>
<P>Review of the evidence on the efficacy of depot formulations of first-generation antipsychotics in comparison with oral formulations indicates that there is only a very modest advantage of depot. There is very little difference between depot and oral formulations in most studies. Patients who volunteer for research are often co-operative patients who will take their medication, particularly if they are seen every few weeks for ratings, reminding them of the importance of adherence to the medication schedule. It is possible that depot risperidone may have a unique benefit in non-compliant patients, but the included studies do not address this issue.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers</HEADING>
<P>Currently, no data are available on satisfaction with care or long-term benefits and we know of no cost-benefit analysis of depot risperidone. In view of this, it is unclear whether the increased costs, which would be incurred purchasing the drug and the additional arrangements needed to administer it, would be justified.</P>

<P>Researchers should provide more details when reporting trials so that it is clear how many people really made significant progress. There should be more effort to assess people at the end of designated study period even if they have failed to complete all follow-up ratings. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a suggested design of future study.</P>

<P>Excluded studies with data relevant to other reviews are highlighted in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Existing reviews are always in the process of update and the older broad multi-comparison titles may be broken down into smaller single comparison reviews. Several of the good studies we had to exclude would find a home in these reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>This review highlights the need for good quality controlled clinical trials to assess the effect and clinical outcomes of using depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. Such studies are difficult and need different designs if they are to be informative. Depots are used for people who do not want to take oral medication. Such people are difficult to randomise. If they are avoided, in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>, the reasonably complete results are difficult to apply. If this difficult group is not avoided, as in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, the explanatory design results in such a degree of attrition as to render results almost entirely without meaning. Pragmatic design could help deal with these problems. People appropriate for depot risperidone, if in agreement, could be randomised to an oral antipsychotic or depot risperidone. Outcomes could then be gathered for events that would be recorded in routine data (discontinuation of medication, specific adverse events, hospitalisation, global improvement whether or not the person stayed on the allocated treatment).</P>
<P>According to the manufacturers of risperidone, Janssen-Cilag Limited, the reason why there are so few studies on depot risperidone is that the compound is unmodified, and is merely delivered differently. More real world trials are required, to establish the efficacy and safety of depot risperidone.</P>

<P>Dear Editor</P>
<P>The purpose of this letter is to provide comment on the recent review of Risperdal Consta long-acting injectable in Schizophrenia. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss issues with the review's conclusions and provide insight into possible solutions to any issues raised.</P>
<P>The content of this discussion will be based on the following key assertions:</P>
<P>- That the review's conclusions are overly critical of available data;<BR/>- That the review's conclusions regarding reliable evidence are potentially misleading and are based on incomplete information;</P>
<P>Comment on these assertions will be focused on the following specific issues:</P>
<P>1. Application of strict methodological rules to placebo controlled trials in schizophrenia leading to exclusion of any data where patient drop outs are &gt;50%. This led to exclusion of key data from Kane et al 2002, where overall drop rates were only 56%.</P>
<P>Additional analysis will be provided for consideration, including:</P>
<P>- Mean change in total PANSS - Results (from total patient cohort and risperidone long-acting injectable monotherapy cohort) up to the Cochrane methodology-defined point where 50% of patients had dropped out (between 6 and 10 weeks and at end-point), show statistically significant differences between risperidone long-acting injectable and placebo. These analyses report on the total 'starting' patient cohort, and separately for the risperidone long-acting injectable 'monotherapy' subset.</P>
<P>- Population analysis for clinical improvement associated with risperidone long-acting injectable showing a conclusive treatment effect unrelated to demographic expectations and low NNT values for significant reduction in Total PANSS.</P>
<P>
<BR/>- Additional testing of an "assumption" of stability after leaving the study by using last observation carried forward (potential impact of drop outs) showed no impact on the conclusions of the study related to the relative comparison of risperidone long-acting injectable to placebo.</P>
<P>2. Identification of specific outcome measures in the review appear to provide potentially misleading or erroneous conclusions.</P>
<P>3. Conclusions based on critique and dismissal of non-inferiority data cause isolation of the effectiveness of risperidone long-acting injectable from established benefits of risperidone compound.</P>
<P>4. Discussion of the risks associated with categorization of risperidone long-acting injectable as a "depot".</P>
<P>Detailed comments<BR/>1. Exclusion of Kane et al 2002 due to drop out rates</P>
<P>We acknowledge the transparent nature of Cochrane methodology and the corresponding universal application of the 50% drop out rate criterion.</P>
<P>Previous Cochrane reviews (1, 2, 3) of atypicals have included studies of shorter duration (e.g. 6-8 weeks). However, concluding that the Kane study provides a lack of reliable data based on an overall drop out rate of 56% over the longer period of 12 weeks, is overly critical. Post-hoc analysis shows that, had this study been ended at 6 weeks the criterion would have been satisfied and, the data would therefore have been included in this review.</P>
<P>To this end, we include in Appendix A the Weighted-mean Difference analyses of mean change in total PANSS from baseline (using Forrest plots) of the <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> (4) data at 6 weeks, where drop outs were less than 50% overall, as well as the end-point last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. Significant effect was seen with both doses at end-point (-8.60 for 25mg/fortnight; -11.20 for 50 mg/fortnight) and for 50mg/fortnight at 6 weeks (Where n&gt;50%), of -8.30.</P>
<P>We also include these analyses for the sub-population known as 'monotherapy'. This included only those patients who underwent a PANSS evaluation after 18 days of oral risperidone supplementation and then continued in the study, thus reflecting the effects - from treatment baseline - of risperidone long-acting injectable alone. Again, both doses were associated with significant effect at end-point (-11.90 for 25 mg/fortnight and -9.60 for 50mg/fortnight) and significantly for 25mg at 10 weeks (n&gt;50%), being -9.10.</P>
<P>Empirical analysis (Chi-squared test) of percentages of 'responders (showing a 20% or greater improvement in Total PANSS)' showed a significant advantage in the risperidone long-acting injectable treatment group at 6 weeks and at end-point for all doses taken together (Appendix B). Furthermore, for this sample, NNT's for a 20% or greater drop in Total PANSS versus placebo were 5.6 (+/- 0.17 for 95% confidence) at 6 weeks and 3.3 (+/- 0.10) at End Point. These results clearly indicate a significant difference from the placebo group.<BR/>Additional analyses were conducted to assess the impact from the level of dropouts in the study on conclusions of Kane et al, 2002. This was an attempt to assess whether the assumption inherent in the regulatory-driven primary LOCF analysis were valid for this trial.</P>
<P>Longitudinal analysis of observed cases were entirely consistent with primary analysis, supporting the overall conclusions. In addition, analysis further to that in the Study Report for Kane et al (2002), tested assumptions more conservative than for LOCF. By adding an assumed 10 points in PANSS to the endpoint change from baseline for all drop outs (i.e. endpoint levels for drop outs were assumed to be 10 points worse at 12 weeks than reported in primary analysis at endpoint), the mean change from baseline for each group was different as would be expected, but the between group comparisons with placebo were still significant.</P>
<P>Also, conclusions did not change when testing the outcome of achieving at least a 20% improvement in total PANSS, where each drop out was set to "No".</P>
<P>As there were differential drop out rates in each group (itself an outcome measure of benefit included in all Cochrane reviews), based on the above, the only way it seems that the conclusions would be altered is if we assume the placebo drop outs would have improved at 12 weeks had they stayed in the trial, and the risperidone long-acting injectable patients would have become worse. Concluding a lack of reliable evidence of clinical benefit of risperidone long-acting injectable based on this assumption, is misleading and overly critical.</P>
<P>Recommendations<BR/>We would request that the total PANSS mean change data from Kane et al 2002 (4) be included in the graphs section, also the population analyses for 'responders' and reviewed in the results text, highlighting the statistically significant differences in favour of risperidone long-acting injectable over placebo. Conclusions should also be altered to reflect that there is reliable RCT data supporting significant benefits of risperidone long-acting injectable for schizophrenia patients.</P>
<P>2. Specific outcome measures</P>
<P>Adverse Events: The review rightly highlights the need for consistency and greater clarity in the reporting of adverse events (Discussion 3.2 'Problematic outcomes', p20) and yet draws some analytical conclusions from such spontaneously reported data (Sections 2.4.2, p18 and Section 4.4, p21). The validity of and - even more thorough - the reporting of adverse events, and the interpretation of these reports as clinical outcomes has to be questioned in the absence of standardised techniques for assessing prevalence and severity of these events.</P>
<P>Trial discontinuation: 'Poor compliance' implies cessation of taking the medication, which is very different from protocol violation. In Analysis: 02.04 ('Poor compliance', p47), the three risk-ratio analyses from the data of Chue et al's 2002 study, show groups of patients who for various reasons were non-compliant with the trial and left the study: this does not necessarily mean that they were non-compliant with the medication and this should be clarified.</P>
<P>
<BR/>3. Dismissal of non-inferiority data and exclusion of benefits already clearly established with risperidone</P>
<P>The results reported for the Chue et al 2002 study (5), critically imply no clear differences between risperidone long-acting injectable and risperidone oral when taken over 12 weeks, without acknowledging that this trial was designed apriori to investigate the hypothesis of non-inferiority.</P>
<P>Further, there is no acknowledgement of the inference of benefits to risperidone long-acting injectable supported by the established safety and effectiveness of risperidone oral in treatment of schizophrenia (which, in turn, is supported by the most recently updated Cochrane review of risperidone versus typical antipsychotics). We find this inconsistent with the review's acknowledgement that the data from Chue et al's study (2002) established non-inferiority of risperidone long-acting injectable compared to oral risperidone ('Main Results', p5) and with the statement - quite correct - that risperidone long-acting injectable "encapsulates unmodified risperidone" and provides "therapeutic blood levels of the drug.." ('background', p7).</P>
<P>Again, the conclusion that there is no reliable evidence to support the claim that risperidone long-acting injectable is beneficial for people with schizophrenia is misleading and potentially harmful.</P>
<P>Recommendations<BR/>That the review should be modified to recognize that, based on a study designed to show non-inferiority, there is clinical equivalence between risperidone long-acting injectable and daily-administered oral risperidone over 12 weeks of therapy. In addition, is would be useful to recognize that advice and requirements of regulatory authorities were strictly adhered to in designing the study, and took into account the delicate ethico-clinical balances involved when designing placebo-controlled trials with this group of severely unwell patients (a point also self-evident from the placebo drop-out rates).</P>
<P>4. Classification of risperidone long-acting injectable as a depot</P>
<P>Risperidone long-acting injectable is the first atypical long-acting compound available for schizophrenia patients. It contains a microspheres technology with a water-based delivery system, clearly differentiating it from traditional oil-based antipsychotic depot medications.</P>
<P>Conventional depot medications, due to their long-standing availability, have established dosage and administration techniques. Labelling risperidone long-acting injectable as "Depot risperidone" is misleading and potentially harmful, as physicians may assume that mode of administration, plasma profile and drug metabolism detriments associated with depot injections apply to risperidone long-acting injectable. These detriments include 'scarring' and subcutaneous nodules due to oil-based residual impurities, pain at site of injection and during the injection, the need to use the painful z-track technique and post-injection seepage of the oily vector. Due to its advanced microspheres technology and aqueous formulation, these major shortcomings are not seen with Risperdal long-acting injectable.</P>
<P>It is clear, therefore, that it is desirable at all levels to separate a description of risperidone long-acting injection from that for the older and problematic depots. Specific concerns are that the confusion caused by this mislabelling could, for example, discourage people prescribing from using risperidone long-acting injection because of their or their patients' previous bad experiences with typical depots. Market research has shown that the term 'depot' has a negative connotation for many patients for the reasons outlined above, and because, over time, depots have been reserved clinically for 'the worst of the worst' -type of patient. The word 'depot' then, is widely seen as a pejorative term. Lastly, the mental image generated by the word 'depot' focuses more with the physical aspects of the older and less sophisticated oily injection that the intramuscular site from which the drug is released.</P>
<P>Together, these issues lead to an unnecessary and inaccurate stigmatization and potential limitation in use of risperidone long-acting injection due to the imposition of a convenient but misleading label.</P>
<P>Recommendations<BR/>The use of "depot risperidone" should be replaced everywhere in the review to risperidone long-acting injectable.</P>
<P>Overall conclusions and recommendations</P>
<P>- Our further analyses of data from the placebo-controlled trial (Kane et al, 2002) demonstrate convincing evidence that risperidone long-acting injectable is beneficial for people with schizophrenia when compared with those taking injectable placebo, both in the short and long-term. The review should acknowledge this and the conclusion (p6) that "there is no reliable evidence that risperidone long-acting injectable is beneficial for people with schizophrenia" should be withdrawn.</P>
<P>- Risperidone long-acting injectable represents a novel and unique delivery of the same active antipsychotic agent as exits in oral formulations of risperidone. Since this fact, as well as the clinical equivalence of risperidone long-acting injectable and oral risperidone are acknowledged in the review, by inference it cannot be safely stated that "there is no reliable evidence that risperidone long-acting injectable is beneficial for people with schizophrenia". A further reason that this conclusion should be withdrawn.</P>
<P>- The use of "depot risperidone" should be replaced everywhere in the review with "risperidone long-acting injectable" since it does not accurately describe risperidone long-acting injectable and may lead to dangerous clinical confusion.</P>
<P>- Finally, conclusions based on spontaneously reported non-clinical events interpreted as outcomes should be treated with caution, as should the assumption that trial protocol violation equated to poor compliance with medication.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-02-24 14:44:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We would like to thank the commentators for their comments and for acknowledging the transparent nature of Cochrane methodology. We would like to discuss the issues raised by them.</P>
<P>1. Exclusion of data from <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>
</P>
<P>We too are concerned with excluding data. We do not, however, agree that loss of 56% of people by 12 weeks should be described as "only 56%" and feel this degree of complacency is lamentable. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) proposed criteria for assessing a randomised controlled trial's quality that included dropout rates suggests that any study of less than three months' duration with a dropout rate exceeding 10% (15% for study of more than three months) should be considered as flawed to a major degree (Hadorn 1996).</P>
<P>The commentators correctly point out that other Cochrane reviews have included studies of shorter duration. The designers of <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> felt that outcomes were meaningful at 12 weeks. We agree. Recalculating now to make the study fit into the less than 50% attrition category contradicts the protocol of the trial. It is a data-driven exercise.</P>
<P>The level of attrition acceptable to reviewers does differ. Partly this is a function of the participants involved, the interventions and the outcome. So for the acute treatment of aggression secondary to psychosis outcomes may be measured in hours and almost any loss to follow-up unacceptable. For longer studies some attrition is deemed acceptable. We thought that the cut off of 50% to be generous. We are sorry that the commentators do not.</P>
<P>We would like to thank the commentators for their sensitivity analysis around their assumptions. First, it seems problematic to us that these analysis cause conclusions to be drawn when over half the data are assumed. Second, we are unsure if a 20% improvement is clinically meaningful and would be more interested in levels of 40% and above. It has been noted in other Cochrane Reviews relevant to risperidone that the 20% cut off may have little clinical meaning (Hunter 2004).</P>
<P>2. Specific outcome measures</P>
<P>Having been criticized for NOT reporting data, because of large loss to follow-up, we are now criticized for reporting data that are there and usable. We are glad that commentators agree that greater clarity is needed in reporting of adverse events and that it is not the best way to interpret clinical outcomes from spontaneously reported data. We hope that the commentators are in a better position to influence trial design to ensure better reporting in their own trials in the future.</P>
<P>With regard to analysis 02.04, we note the comment that non-compliance does not necessarily mean poor compliance with medication and have amended this in the text.</P>
<P>Current text reads "Compliance was measured in several ways. Most people received at least four injections (83.4% in the depot group and 85.6% in the oral risperidone group, n=640, RR &lt;4 injections or "major protocol violation" 1.16 CI 0.81 to 1.67). There was no difference between groups in the rate of discontinuation before the end of the 12-week study (n=640, RR 1.27 CI 0.90 to 1.78)."</P>
<P>Amended text reads "Compliance was measured in several ways. Most people received at least four injections (83.4% in the depot group and 85.6% in the oral risperidone group, n=640, RR &lt;4 injections or "major protocol violation" 1.16 CI 0.81 to 1.67). There was no difference between groups in the rate of discontinuation before the end of the 12-week study (n=640, RR 1.27 CI 0.90 to 1.78). Please note that 'compliance' in this context could apply to protocol violation for many reasons only one of which would be non-compliance with the study drugs."</P>
<P>3. Dismissal of non-inferiority data and exclusion of benefits already clearly established with risperidone</P>
<P>The commentators are correct to point out that we have not worded the conclusions well. We intended to state that there are no clear differences between the depot preparation of risperidone and oral risperidone in people whose symptoms are already controlled using oral risperidone. This does not imply that actively symptomatic patients would benefit from the depot preparation. We have stated in the conclusion that "People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term." As we have not been clear enough in the conclusions we have reworded them. We have also emphasised the possible benefits for people who are non compliant with medications in the real world who are unlikely to voulnteer for a clinical trial.</P>
<P>Current version of conclusions in the ABSTRACT reads<BR/>"There is no reliable data to support the claim that depot risperidone is beneficial for people with schizophrenia. For reasonably well, stable people it may mean that the need for regular oral doses can be avoided, but adverse affects are not well reported. For more severely ill people, few benefits are evident although it may increase compliance with injections in comparison with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders."</P>
<P>Updated version in response to this comment reads<BR/>"For reasonably well, stable people use of the depot formulation may mean that the need for regular doses of oral risperidone can be avoided, but adverse affects of the depot formulation are not well reported. For such people, depot risperidone may be as effective as the oral preparation, although data are few. For more severely ill people, few benefits of depot risperidone are evident although it may increase compliance with injections in comparison with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders."</P>
<P>Current version of conclusions in the IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE reads<BR/>Implications for practice<BR/>For people with schizophrenia<BR/>There are only two studies on which to base an informed choice about depot risperidone. Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term.<BR/>For clinicians<BR/>There is no reliable data to support the claim that depot risperidone is beneficial to people with schizophrenia. For reasonably well and stable people it may mean they can avoid taking regular oral doses but adverse affects are not well reported. When given to more severely ill people, few benefits were demonstrated in the short term, although it may increase compliance with injections compared with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders.</P>
<P>Updated version in response to this comment reads<BR/>For people with schizophrenia<BR/>There are only two studies on which to base an informed choice about depot risperidone. Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone as seen within the considerable limitations of the relevant study. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second-generation antipsychotic to people who do not reliable adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benifit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects.</P>
<P>For clinicians<BR/>For reasonably well and stable people it may mean they can avoid taking regular oral doses but adverse affects are not well reported. When given to more severely ill people, few benefits were demonstrated in the short term, although it may increase compliance with injections compared with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders.<BR/>Review of the evidence on the efficacy of depot formulations of first-generation antipsychotics in comparison with oral indicates that there is only a very modest advantage of depot. There is very little difference between depot and oral in most studies. Patients who volunteer for research are often cooperative patients who will take their medication particularly if they are seen every few weeks for ratings, reminding them of the importance of adherence to the medication schedule. The importance of the two risperidone depot studies is to indicate that this preparation may be effective within the limitations of the methodology. It is possible that depot risperidone may have a unique benefit in non-compliant patients but the included studies do not address this issue.</P>
<P>
<BR/>4. We do not agree that the labelling of risperidone long acting injection as depot risperidone is misleading. The difference in the meaning of depot injection and long acting injection is none for all practicable purpose. The debate is more of semantics. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the physiological meaning of 'depot' as "the site of an accumulation or deposit of a substance (esp. fat) in an animal body&#8230;.applied to any substance stored for eventual absorption by the organism, or to an action or process concerned with the deposition of such a substance." (OED 1989) We acknowledge that the risperidone preparation that is the focus of this review is not deposited in fat. It is, however, clearly comes with the meaning of "deposited in an animal body and a substance stored for eventual absorption by the organism."</P>
<P>The word depot may have negative connotation within psychiatry but it does not take away from the fact depot means a long acting injectable preparation. For marketing purposes the manufactures may want to use different terms/names to differentiate it from other drugs, but from a clinical point of view it is a depot preparation which means a long acting injection, whatever may be its technical differences from the other drugs.</P>
<P>Nowhere in the reports on risperidone injectable preparations it has been claimed that it is not a depot. The term long acting injection has been used as a synonym for the depot in these reports. For example <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> states&#8230; "Currently, however, only typical psychotropics have been available as long acting formulations. Risperidone is the first atypical psychotropic medication available in a long acting formulation". Therefore there is no justification to alter the word "depot" to "long acting injection" throughout the review.</P>

<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>Two reviewers (PH, JD) independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. Any disagreement was discussed and reported.</P>
<P>2. Quality assessment<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>) by each reviewer, again, working independently. When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible, and further information was necessary, data were not entered into the analyses and the study was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review.</P>
<P>3. Data management</P>
<P>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>Two reviewers (PH, JD) independently extracted data and, where further clarification was needed, contacted authors of trials to provide missing data.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>Data were excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% drop-out rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) was analysed in a sensitivity analysis for primary outcomes. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, the data were not added to trials with less attrition, but presented separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis</P>
<P>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Intention-to-treat analyses versus analyses that only take into account those who completed the study: in the case of continuous data, it was supposed that in many cases an intention-to-treat analysis would not be available, so an analysis was presented on those who completed the study.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Rating scales: a wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. Continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>), the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, such data was tagged as 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Normal distribution of data: mental health continuous data are often not normally distributed. Most statistics assume a normal distribution. To avoid including non-normally distributed data in the statistical analysis, the following criteria are applied to all data before inclusion:</P>
<P>a. Standard deviations and means were reported or derivable from data in the paper, or were obtainable from the authors.<BR/>b. When a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them.<BR/>c. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values. If endpoint data were not available, reviewers chose to use change data, because the statistics used in Metaview are rather robust towards skew.<BR/>d. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30-210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: endpoint scale-derived data are finite, ranging from one score to another. Change data are more problematic and for it the rule described above does not hold. Although most change scores are likely to be skewed, this cannot be proven so they were presented in MetaView. Where both endpoint and change were available for the same outcome, we presented the former in preference.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes, a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again, a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>4.3 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Secondly, RevMan does not currently support meta-analytic pooling of clustered dichotomous data, even when these are correctly analysed by the authors of primary studies, since the 'design effect' (a statistical correction for clustering) cannot be incorporated.</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with an asterisk (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies, to seek intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, then we presented these data in a table. No further secondary analysis (including meta-analytic pooling) will be attempted until there is consensus on the best methods of doing so, and until RevMan, or any other software, allows this. A Cochrane Statistical Methods Workgroup is currently addressing this issue. In the interim, individual studies were very crudely classified as positive or negative, according to whether a statistically significant result (p&lt;0. 05) was obtained for the outcome in question, using an analytic method that allows for clustering.</P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>A Chi-square test was used, as well as visual inspection of graphs, to investigate the possibility of heterogeneity. A significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found, the data were re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, the studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, reviewers entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for depot risperidone.</P>

<P>4. Included studies<BR/>Two studies, reported as nine conference presentations and one full paper met the selection criteria and are included.</P>
<P>4.1 Study design<BR/>All included studies were randomised and X featured some form of blinding, though the extent of this varied widely.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> involved an eight-week run in period preceding randomisation. In the first two weeks, antipsychotic drugs other than risperidone were discontinued and oral risperidone introduced. In the next two weeks the risperidone dose was optimised and then people continued on this dose of oral risperidone for another four weeks before randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> had a two-week run in period preceding randomisation. The first week was a screening week followed by seven days during which people were started on oral risperidone and the dose was titrated to 4mg/day.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>People entering both studies met the criteria for DSM IV schizophrenia, so for at least six continuous months a participant must have shown some evidence of schizophrenia, and for at least one month must have shown at least two symptoms of frank psychosis. These symptoms would include delusions, hallucinations, incoherent speech, disorganised or catatonic behaviour, or flat affect. To meet DSM IV criteria, the symptoms must be disabling in such a way that social and occupational functioning is impaired; these symptoms should not be the direct result of a physical disorder or of substance misuse.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> people who had substance dependence, tardive dyskinesia or a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, ECG abnormalities, suicidal ideas or risk of violent behaviour were excluded. Patients who had a history of unresponsiveness to risperidone were also excluded.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> also stipulated that participants should have a total PANSS score of at least 50. This, in addition to the fulfilment the DSM IV criteria, means that people with at least some active symptoms of illness were included. In effect, despite the rigorous entry criteria, nearly 47% of people entering this study were rated by the authors as ''not ill'' or only ''mildly ill'' at baseline assessment on the CGI scale before randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> randomised 640 people. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, however, randomised 400 people who appeared to be more severely ill. They had a baseline PANSS score in the range of 60-120, with an average of about 80.</P>
<P>In both studies, participants were mainly men (about 70%) with an average age of about 40 years.</P>
<P>4.3 Interventions<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> randomised people to an active injection every two weeks and placebo tablets daily, or a placebo injection every two weeks and active tablets daily. Depending on the optimal stabilisation dose the person was randomised to continue that oral regimen or start the 'equivalent' dose of depot. For example, 2mg of oral risperidone per day was taken as being equivalent to 25mg of depot risperidone every two weeks. It is not clear, however, how the conversion dose was arrived at.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> randomised people to either a placebo injection or 25mg or 50mg or 75mg of depot risperidone every two weeks. People also received either placebo tablets or 2mg or 4mg or 6mg of oral risperidone respectively for the first three weeks after randomisation.</P>
<P>4.4 Outcomes<BR/>4.4.1 Global improvement<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> reported global improvement in the form of the percentage of people who were not ill or mildly ill on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the end of the study period. Throughout this study results are reported for oral and depot groups as a whole, and not for specific dosage groups of depot. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> did not report mean or change scores in the abstracts available for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> also used the CGI but reported average change from baseline to endpoint and data were unusable due to the substantial attrition.</P>
<P>4.4.2 Mental state<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> interpreted an improvement of more than 20% in PANSS total score as clinically important. This study also reported average change at endpoint from baseline in PANSS total, PANSS positive and PANSS negative but again so much data were lost because people left the study early that the results of the PANSS were unusable. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> reported average change scores on PANSS total at endpoint in both the composite oral and depot groups. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> did not seem to stipulate cut off points as 'clinically important improvement'.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Both studies reported numbers discontinuing the study and specific reasons for this, such as adverse events, compliance problems and insufficient responses.</P>
<P>4.4.4 Adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> reported overall rates of adverse events in both groups, and the numbers withdrawing from the study as a result of side effects. No details were given regarding the nature of these adverse events or how they were recorded. The abstracts available for this review state that body weight was measured and laboratory tests were undertaken. The reports state that there were no differences between oral and depot groups, but present no numbers. <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> also used the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) but, again, no numerical data were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> reported rates of individual adverse events spontaneously reported by participants, and reported these for all people in the study, not just those who completed the trial. Median ESRS scores were also reported for each group at baseline and change at endpoint. Pain and swelling at injection sites rated by investigators and patients were also reported.</P>
<P>4.4.5 Outcome measures used in this review</P>
<P>Global functioning. Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>)<BR/>This scale was developed to evaluate the positive, negative and general symptoms in schizophrenia. The PANSS has 30 items, and each item can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from one (absent) to seven (extreme). This scale is divided into three subscales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity.</P>
<P>Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items) and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>4.4.6 Missing outcomes<BR/>There are no data for outcomes beyond three months. Neither are data available on general functioning and change in behaviour. Nor were there any details on service outcomes, engagement with services, satisfaction with services, quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>

<P>3. COMPARISON: 2. DEPOT RISPERIDONE vs ORAL RISPERIDONE</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> compared depot risperidone against oral risperidone</P>
<P>3.1 Global improvement<BR/>The study did not report mean scores on the CGI scale. The trialists did report percentage of people mildly ill or not ill in both the depot risperidone and oral risperidone groups at the end of the study period, as rated using the CGI (about 57% as read from the graph, compared to 47% at baseline). Hence 43% must have been moderately ill or severely ill at the end of the study period. There was no difference between the depot group and the oral group (n=640, RR 1.06 CI 0.92 to 1.22).</P>
<P>3.1.1 Mental state<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> reported both average end score and change across time. For endpoint score there was no difference between groups (MD 0.00 CI -2.91 to 2.91), nor was there any difference between depot and oral risperidone for average change in the total PANSS score (n=541, WMD -0.90 CI -2.84 to 1.04), PANSS positive (WMD -0.30 CI -0.86 to 0.26) and PANSS negative scores (WMD -0.10 CI -0.93 to 0.73).</P>
<P>3.2 Poor compliance<BR/>Compliance was measured in several ways. Most people received at least four injections (83.4% in the depot group and 85.6% in the oral risperidone group, n=640, RR &lt;4 injections or "major protocol violation" 1.16 CI 0.81 to 1.67). There was no difference between groups in the rate of discontinuation before the end of the 12-week study (n=640, RR 1.27 CI 0.90 to 1.78). Please note that 'compliance' in this context could apply to protocol violation for many reasons only one of which would be non-compliance with the study drugs."</P>
<P>3.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Adverse events are reported in order of severity. One death was reported in the oral risperidone group (n=640, RR death 1.04 CI 0.91 to 1.18). Low proportions of people had to withdraw from the study due to adverse events and there were no differences between the oral and depot preparation (n=640, RR 1.21 CI 0.62 to 2.35). Over half of both groups reported some adverse effects (n=640, RR 1.04 CI 0.91 to 1.18)</P>

<P>4. COMPARISON: 1. DEPOT RISPERIDONE vs PLACEBO</P>
<P>4.1 Global improvement<BR/>No meaningful conclusions can be drawn as more than 50% of patients did not complete the trial. Hence the authors' conclusion that depot risperidone is superior to placebo is based on very limited data. Currently clinicians, recipients of care and researchers do not know if risperidone depot is any better than placebo in terms of global improvement in the short term.</P>
<P>4.2 Mental state<BR/>The main mental state outcome (20% improvement in the PANSS total score) conveys no useful information as half the data are based on an assumption. From data presented on adverse effects, it is possible to get some data on mental state. Risperidone depot does not seem to affect symptoms of anxiety or nervousness but it may decrease agitation. There is no evidence that depot risperidone effects hallucination but the frequency of 'psychosis' was reduced. We are unsure what this means when both are reported as adverse effects. Overall the information regarding the effects on mental state of long acting risperidone compared with placebo is poor.</P>
<P>4.3 Leaving the study early.<BR/>The majority of participants did not complete the 12-week study period which makes it difficult to believe that depot risperidone might improve compliance. The drop out rate was higher in the placebo group but the NNT was six. Six people have to be treated with risperidone depot to avoid one person being leaving care when compared to the attrition from placebo injection treatment.</P>
<P>4.4 Adverse effects<BR/>Only spontaneously reported adverse events in more than 5% of the participants were reported. Adverse effects which were not reported by the patient, or that were infrequent might have gone unnoticed. Serious adverse effects (those that resulted in death or were life threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect) were reported in such a way that the reviewers were left in some doubt about safety. Firstly, overall, these were common (13-23%). Although there was no collective difference between the experimental and control groups it is feasible that those allocated to placebo needed 'prolongation of hospitalisation' and those given the depot drug encountered 'life threatening' effects. The lack of statistical difference in the 'lumped' data could mask real and disturbing effects. This review does not reassure users of long acting risperidone as regards safety.</P>
<P>The adverse effects that were reported clearly tended to suggest that the depot compound did cause some unwanted effects and that there may be a dose effect. The movement disorder effects were convincing of this. This 'atypical' drug seems to cause extrapyramidal effects, hyperkinesis and hypertonia, especially at the higher doses.</P>
<P>This depot may also cause more sleepiness and weight gain than placebo, but, as for all these adverse effects, more data are needed to confirm this.</P>
<P>5. COMPARISON: 2. DEPOT RISPERIDONE vs ORAL RISPERIDONE</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> compared depot risperidone with oral risperidone. The main problem with this study is that it involved well people who are unlikely to be those for whom depot is very relevant.</P>
<P>5.1 Global improvement<BR/>Data were difficult to extract from the conference proceedings and may have to be revised once the full paper is published, but there seems to be very little difference between the depot and oral forms of risperidone in terms of global improvement. This is encouraging, suggesting that the depot form is as effective as the oral. People already doing well on oral risperidone will continue to do so with depot risperidone.</P>
<P>5.2 Mental state<BR/>Depot risperidone is similar to oral risperidone in terms of the changes in PANSS scores, thus confirming the impression that there is little difference between the oral and depot preparations for people who are compliant.</P>
<P>5.3 Poor compliance<BR/>One major reason for giving a depot is to aid poor compliance. For this client group, there was no difference between the oral and depot groups in terms of several ways of measuring compliance. This probably reflects the design of the study where only compliant people were asked to participate. This greatly reduces the value of the study for generalising to real world circumstances.</P>
<P>5.4 Adverse effects.<BR/>Again there is no clear difference between the oral and depot forms of risperidone, although more data may be available in the fully published paper. However, it should be noted that over half of both groups reported some adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>3. Limited data</P>
<P>3.1 Loss of data<BR/>Schizophrenia is often a chronic illness, which may require medication on a long-term basis. In <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, 56% of patients left the study in the first 12 weeks. We will discuss the differential loss to follow-up below, but it would be difficult to encourage long-term use of depot risperidone based on the findings of this study. It is likely that this huge loss of patients, greater than would be expected in clinical practice, may result from the limitations of study design where a rigid protocol is imposed on people who are unwell. When a similar protocol is implemented on reasonably well people attrition is less (17%, <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>). Clinicians prefer depot for people who are already having difficulty in complying with treatment. In such a situation clinical common sense indicates that depot preparation may be more helpful, but pragmatic trials are required to confirm this.</P>
<P>3.2 Missing outcomes<BR/>Risperidone depot is one of the options for the long-term treatment of people with schizophrenia. However, there are no outcomes rated beyond 12 weeks in the current studies, and much of the three-month data are 'carried forward' from the true time the person decided to leave the study. There are hardly any data on general functioning and change in behaviour, and none on service outcomes, engagement with services, satisfaction with services, quality of life or costs. It would seem important to address these deficiencies.</P>
<P>3.3 Problematic outcomes<BR/>More clarity is needed in the reporting of adverse effects. In <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, only spontaneously reported adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients are recorded. This raises the possibility that some rare but clinically important adverse events may have been under-reported. In the conference proceedings we have for <LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK>, no specific adverse effects, except death, are reported. We recognise that it is a huge task to report every adverse event but unless careful attention is paid to rare adverse events they might go unnoticed.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK> full paper also groups severe adverse effects in an unusual way. It is possible that the lumping together of several 'severe' effects, some of which may be not as severe as others, could mask real effects of the interventions.</P>
<P>2. Applicability<BR/>2.1 Diagnosis<BR/>Both the included studies used DSM IV operational criteria to help select participants. The use of these criteria means that participants are homogenous and that the study subsequently has greater internal validity, but external validity, i.e. applicability to the every day world of psychiatric care, is likely to be limited.</P>
<P>2.2 Severity of illness<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chue 2002</LINK> included only people who were already stabilised on oral risperidone. Even though the inclusion criteria stipulated a PANSS score of &gt;50, nearly half the participants were described as mildly ill or not ill at all on the CGI scale at baseline. From this study one can only infer the effects of depot risperidone on stable, reasonably well people. This study does not answer questions as to whether depot risperidone is helpful for people who are very ill. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2002_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2002*</LINK>, however, includes patients who were experiencing more symptoms, as observed by the high baseline PANSS total score.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>1. Quality of studies<BR/>It is disappointing that the reporting of studies was not better. Perhaps to hope that CONSORT requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) should be met in conference proceedings is ambitious, but at least they should be considered when they are published in full. Both studies appear to be vulnerable to inclusion bias in favour of risperidone depot.</P>
