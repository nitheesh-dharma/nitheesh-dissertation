<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-16 19:09:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of viral disease in people who have received kidney, heart, liver, lung or pancreas transplants (solid organ transplants). CMV is a major cause of illness and death during the first six months after transplantation. Characteristics of CMV include fever, very low white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and very low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia) with or without specific organ involvement.</P>
<P>Two main strategies to prevent CMV disease have been adopted: giving daily low doses of an antiviral agent (prophylaxis) to all organ transplant recipients, or prescribing an antiviral agent when an organ transplant recipient develops laboratory-confirmed evidence of infection during routine screening (pre-emptive treatment).</P>
<P>This review looked at the benefits and harms of pre-emptive treatment with antiviral agents in preventing CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. We identified six studies (288 participants) that compared pre-emptive treatment with placebo or usual care. Pre-emptive treatment significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease. There were also eight studies (784 participants) that compared pre-emptive treatment with antiviral prophylaxis. There were no significant differences in the risks of CMV disease or death between pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis. However, variation in results among studies meant that there is some uncertainty about these results.</P>
<P>Low white blood cell counts were much less common with pre-emptive treatment.</P>
<P>More studies comparing pre-emptive treatment with antiviral prophylaxis are still required to provide greater certainty about the relative effectiveness of pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis.</P>

<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Pre-emptive treatment of patients with CMV viraemia using antiviral agents has been suggested as an alternative to routine prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-29 14:30:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 15 eligible studies (1098 participants). Of these, six investigated pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or treatment of CMV when disease occurred (standard care), eight looked at pre-emptive treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis, and one reported on oral versus intravenous pre-emptive treatment.</P>
<P>Assessment of risk of bias identified that the processes reported for sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in only five and three studies, respectively. All studies were considered to be at low risk of attrition bias, and seven studies were considered to be at low risk of bias for selective reporting. Only one study reported adequate blinding of participants and personnel; no study reported blinding of outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo or standard care, pre-emptive treatment significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease (6 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80) but not acute rejection (3 studies, 185 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.12) or all-cause mortality (3 studies, 176 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.30). Comparative studies of pre-emptive therapy versus prophylaxis showed no significant differences in preventing CMV disease between pre-emptive and prophylactic therapy (7 studies, 753 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.74) but there was significant heterogeneity (I = 63%). Leucopenia was significantly less common with pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis (6 studies, 729 participants: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.90). Other adverse effects did not differ significantly or were not reported. There were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, graft loss, acute rejection and infections other than CMV.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-16 17:49:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Few RCTs have evaluated the effects of pre-emptive therapy to prevent CMV disease. Pre-emptive therapy is effective compared with placebo or standard care. Despite the inclusion of five additional studies in this update, the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease remains unclear due to significant heterogeneity between studies. Additional head-to-head studies are required to determine the relative benefits and harms of pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-29 14:30:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-29 14:30:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients, with up to 75% of patients developing or reactivating infection after transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 2007</LINK>). The risk of developing CMV is well established. CMV infection and disease are seen most commonly in CMV negative recipients of CMV seropositive organs and in recipients treated with anti-lymphocyte therapy (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2000</LINK>). Recipients who have a positive serostatus for CMV, regardless of donor status, are at intermediate risk of developing or re-developing CMV; donor negative organs and negative serostatus recipients are at the lowest risk of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>CMV can lead to direct or indirect effects of infection. Direct effects include CMV syndrome (encompassing fever, myelosuppression, myalgia and arthralgia), tissue invasive CMV disease leading to hepatitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonitis and potentially any other organ or body tissue, and finally, mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Eid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 2010</LINK>). CMV infection may also be associated with indirect effects including acute and chronic organ rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections other than CMV, and new onset diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Eid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-19 15:51:36 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pre-emptive therapy involves the detection of active CMV replication through routine surveillance using an appropriately sensitive and specific test (such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or pp65 antigenaemia assay) with established thresholds for CMV infection. Once the CMV infection threshold has been reached, treatment with antiviral medications (valganciclovir or ganciclovir) is initiated with the aim of preventing progression to symptomatic CMV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-19 15:55:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention aims to direct treatment to patients who are most at risk of developing CMV disease, rather than administering universal prophylaxis that would include some patients who would never develop CMV disease. By targeting higher risk patients it should be possible to direct therapy to those in need, to reduce the risk of adverse effects associated with long-term antiviral therapy, and possibly, to lower the cost of therapy. Pre-emptive therapy may also reduce the numbers of patients who develop late onset CMV disease after prophylaxis is ceased (<LINK REF="REF-Eid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-16 18:33:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pre-emptive treatment of recipients with CMV viraemia detected on surveillance has been advocated as an alternative to antiviral prophylaxis because only recipients who develop CMV infection, and are thus at high risk of CMV disease, are treated. This approach exposes patients to a lower risk of adverse effects of medications and may reduce the risk of the emergence of resistant strains of CMV and of late onset CMV disease, which has been reported as increasing in frequency in solid organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Arthurs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthurs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arthurs-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthurs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2010</LINK>). Late onset CMV disease is seen in about 10% of patients given 12 weeks of oral ganciclovir prophylaxis but is rare following pre-emptive regimens.</P>
<P>It has been argued that pre-emptive treatment in CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organs allows controlled viral replication to occur before antiviral medications are administered (<LINK REF="REF-Limaye-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limaye 2000</LINK>). This could result in the development of specific immune responses which are important in the prevention of future episodes of CMV disease.</P>
<P>Pre-emptive therapy appears particularly attractive in recipients at low risk of CMV disease such as CMV positive recipients of kidney transplants who are not receiving antibody immunosuppression because their risk of CMV disease is only about 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Waiser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waiser 1998</LINK>). However, pre-emptive therapy relies on the timely availability of sensitive and reliable methods for detecting CMV viraemia so that treatment based on identifying CMV infection can be initiated before CMV disease develops. Furthermore, the cost of screening may be higher than prophylaxis even though the cost of antiviral medication is lower (<LINK REF="REF-Eid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 2010</LINK>). Pre-emptive therapy potentially exposes patients to periods of CMV infection and possibly indirect effects of CMV infection. Moreover, treatment method relies on the patient's compliance with regular screening and easy access to a transplant centre if treatment is required.</P>
<P>Prophylaxis is currently the predominant intervention used to prevent CMV disease. Routine antiviral prophylaxis is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects of medications, the development of CMV resistance and late onset CMV disease when prophylaxis is discontinued and is costly (<LINK REF="REF-Arthurs-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthurs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emery-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2001</LINK>). Prophylaxis for all organ transplant recipients (except CMV negative recipients of CMV negative donors) means that a proportion of patients will receive potentially harmful medications when they were not destined to develop CMV disease.</P>
<P>In view of the actual and potential advantages and disadvantages of pre-emptive therapy and of prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease, a systematic review was warranted to ascertain the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy and the relative benefits and harms of these therapies for preventing CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients.</P>
<P>This Cochrane systematic review should be considered in conjunction with the Cochrane review <I>Antiviral therapy for preventing CMV disease in solid organ transplants recipients </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK>) which looked at the benefits and harms of prophylaxis with antiviral medications to prevent CMV disease. <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK> includes 37 studies (4342 participants). Prophylaxis with ganciclovir, valaciclovir or aciclovir (19 studies, 1981 participants) significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease, CMV infection and all-cause mortality compared with placebo or no specific therapy. In direct comparison studies, ganciclovir was significantly more effective than aciclovir (7 studies, 1113 participants). Valganciclovir was as effective as ganciclovir (1 study, 364 participants) and extended duration valganciclovir significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease compared with three months (2 studies, 454 participants).</P>

<P>The combined updated study data included 1098 participants from 15 studies. Three intervention rationales were investigated by these studies.</P>
<P>One rationale involved randomising participants at transplant to receive viral surveillance and pre-emptive treatment on development of CMV viraemia versus prophylaxis with antiviral medications for 30 to 168 days (8 studies, 785 participants: <LINK REF="STD-Gerna-2008-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Gerna 2008 Liver</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2001-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2001 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoury-2006-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 2006 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kliem-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Kliem 2008 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Queiroga-2003-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Queiroga 2003 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2008 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1994-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1994 Liver</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witzke-2012-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Witzke 2012 Kidney</LINK>). (This was the only rationale in previous iterations of this review to which new study data were added for this update).</P>
<P>A second rationale involved randomising participants to pre-emptive treatment or to placebo or no specific therapy (6 studies, 291 participants: <LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1997a-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1997a Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koetz-2001-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Koetz 2001 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paya-2002-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Paya 2002 Liver</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2001-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2001 Liver</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sagedal-2003-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Sagedal 2003 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-1998-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1998 Kidney</LINK>).

<P>There were 1393 patients screened for entry to the six studies of pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or standard care. Of these, 1035 patients were excluded (no CMV viraemia in 597, CMV viraemia below threshold for study entry in 116, other reasons in 322) so that 358 patients were eligible for study entry. However, 64 patients (17.8%) developed CMV disease within the 0 to 10 day time gap between testing for viraemia and randomisation, and thus were excluded. The proportion of patients in each study who developed CMV disease before CMV viraemia was detected varied from 0% to 32%.

<P>There was considerable heterogeneity among the seven studies (I = 67%). Of these, two favoured pre-emptive therapy and two favoured prophylaxis.

Investigation of the <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1994-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1994 Liver</LINK> study indicated that an inferior agent (aciclovir) was used in the prophylaxis arm compared with a superior agent (ganciclovir) in the pre-emptive arm (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK>) which may have exerted a favourable influence on pre-emptive treatment. Investigation of the <LINK REF="STD-Khoury-2006-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 2006 Kidney</LINK> study did not yield any substantial differences to account for the reduction in heterogeneity.</P>
<P>It was found that alternately excluding the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kliem-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Kliem 2008 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witzke-2012-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Witzke 2012 Kidney</LINK>) that favoured prophylaxis, the relative risk supported pre-emptive therapy, although the result was not significant (5 studies, 319 participants: RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.11).</P>

No heterogeneity existed among the studies for all-cause mortality. Some degree of heterogeneity existed in the graft loss analysis (I = 41%) and acute rejection (I = 44%) analyses. Heterogeneity was considerably diminished (I = 14%) in the graft loss analysis when <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2001-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2001 Kidney</LINK> was excluded. The only differences observed between <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2001-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2001 Kidney</LINK> and all other studies were a later start for prophylaxis and a higher dose of oral ganciclovir (3000 mg/d compared with 1500 mg to 2000 mg/d).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was abolished entirely in the acute rejection analysis when the study by <LINK REF="STD-Witzke-2012-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Witzke 2012 Kidney</LINK> was excluded from the analysis.

<P>In general, other adverse effects were poorly reported in eight pre-emptive therapy versus prophylaxis studies; one study (<LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2008 Kidney</LINK>) provided most of the data (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-16 18:37:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified eight studies that compared pre-emptive with prophylactic therapy (784 patients) and six studies that compared pre-emptive therapy versus placebo or standard care (288 patients) where the primary outcome was CMV disease. Tests and thresholds used to detect CMV viraemia were different across the studies, but results were generally consistent. Confidence intervals were wide across most outcomes, indicating considerable imprecision (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Fewer patients were evaluated for other outcomes, and CIs around observed treatment effects were so wide that other benefits (or harms) of pre-emptive therapy could not be excluded.</P>
<P>Pre-emptive treatment using standard detection methods for CMV viraemia was 71% more effective than placebo or standard care in reducing the risk of CMV disease (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80). CMV organ involvement was 59% lower in the pre-emptive therapy regime compared with the placebo/standard care regime. However, the quality of evidence was low due to small patient numbers and lack of blinding across all studies. No significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, acute rejection, graft loss, other infections, leucopenia, or kidney dysfunction were demonstrated between pre-emptive therapy and placebo or standard care (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in preventing CMV disease using pre-emptive versus prophylactic therapy. However, there was significant heterogeneity among studies so that superiority of one or other treatment could not be excluded. The major benefit observed for pre-emptive therapy was a 58% reduction in leucopenia compared with prophylaxis, while other adverse effects did not differ significantly, or were not reported. There were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, graft loss, acute rejection and infections other than CMV. There was also no significant difference observed between pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis with regards to CMV disease in high risk solid organ transplant patients (D+/R-) (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study of oral versus IV pre-emptive regimens was included in this review; it showed no significant difference in the risk of CMV disease between the groups.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that oral ganciclovir, which was the basis for three of the included analyses, is no longer available and has been replaced by valganciclovir.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-16 18:37:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the evidence from the 15 studies included in this review prevented confident conclusions to be made on the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy in preventing CMV disease, graft loss, acute rejection and all-cause mortality in comparison with placebo/no specific treatment or with prophylaxis. This was primarily due to a lack of adequately powered studies and low precision of the measured outcomes. There was also a lack of studies that compared pre-emptive therapy across a broad range of different transplanted organs; the highest representation was for kidney transplant recipients among the 15 studies included in this review.</P>
<P>Many studies did not address important outcomes, including adverse effects of medications. In contrast, the evidence base for routine prophylaxis compared with placebo/no specific therapy is substantial, arising from 19 studies of 1981<B> </B>participants (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK>) which enabled more precise results to be derived.</P>
<P>Prophylaxis has been shown to reduce CMV disease by about 60% (RR = 0.42), with tight CIs (0.34 to 0.52), strong evidence of statistically significant benefit (P &lt; 0.0001), and considerable homogeneity of results across all studies (I = 13%, where only one of the point estimates of the 19 studies did not favour prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiviral prophylaxis has been shown to reduce CMV-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and clinically important disease caused by opportunistic infections.</P>
<P>Although both prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2013</LINK>) and pre-emptive therapy significantly reduce CMV disease compared with placebo or no specific therapy in solid organ transplant recipients, this review has demonstrated that the available data evaluating pre-emptive therapy (6 studies; 288 participants) was of low quality (GRADE) compared with the high quality data (GRADE) evaluating antiviral prophylaxis (19 studies; 1981 participants).</P>
<P>There appeared to be little evidence that the use of medications now considered to be less effective than valganciclovir or ganciclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pescovitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pescovitz 2007</LINK>) influenced the results in studies comparing pre-emptive therapy with prophylaxis. Two studies (117 participants) of eight studies used aciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1994-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1994 Liver</LINK>) or valaciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2008 Kidney</LINK>) in the prophylaxis arm of the studies. This would potentially favour pre-emptive therapy and could have contributed to the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1994-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1994 Liver</LINK> study. All studies comparing pre-emptive therapy with placebo or no specific therapy used ganciclovir, which has been superseded by valganciclovir for prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy. RCT data have shown no significant difference in efficacy for prophylaxis of CMV disease between ganciclovir and valganciclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005</LINK>) so it can be presumed that valganciclovir would be more effective than placebo in prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy studies, although this has not been formally tested in RCTs.</P>
<P>There was also substantial difference among studies with regard to CMV surveillance testing. The type of test used (pp65 antigenaemia assay or PCR DNA), the assays used, the frequency of surveillance (weekly to monthly), the cut-off values (DNA PCR &gt; 400 to &gt; 2000 copies/mL) to define CMV infection and the blood component used for testing were factors contributing to these differences. This large variability among studies further reduced confidence of drawing definite conclusions about the applicability of pre-emptive therapy for several reasons. Longer time intervals between surveillance tests potentially increases the chances of CMV infection not being detected so that the patient develops CMV disease before he or she can be entered in a study. This means that the proportion of preventable CMV disease patients in the pre-emptive arm may have erroneously increased. Lower cut-off values used for diagnosing CMV infection with more frequent testing could result in earlier detection of CMV infection and enable earlier initiation of therapy to prevent CMV disease and reduce the effects of indirect CMV infection. Alternatively, higher cut-off values with longer periods between tests could result in delayed therapy and potentially increase the number of preventable CMV disease cases. Finally, PCR testing needs consideration as to what component of blood is being tested; whole blood will often yield higher rates of CMV DNA compared to plasma (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-21 18:05:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified 15 studies of 1094 participants; of these, 784 participants were evaluated in studies that compared pre-emptive therapy with prophylaxis; and 288 were evaluated in studies that compared pre-emptive therapy with placebo/no specific treatment. The 15 studies failed to report all relevant outcomes, were frequently at high risk of bias, demonstrated imprecision and heterogeneity among studies which lowered the integrity of the meta-analysed results.</P>
<P>The poorly reported methods of randomisation and allocation concealment have prevented an accurate assessment of the risk of selection bias: only three studies adequately performed both. The lack of allocation concealment in these studies introduced the potential to overestimate outcome benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Hewitt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitt 2005</LINK>). The blinding of outcome assessors and personnel was poorly performed in most studies; only one reported blinding of participants and investigators. The blinding of outcome assessors was not conducted in any study because all study authors were judged to also be outcome assessors. Therefore, most included studies were at high risk of both performance and detection bias. The risk of attrition bias was considered to be low in all studies. Half of the studies did not include outcomes that were assessed to be important by the review authors.</P>
<P>Pre-emptive therapy compared with placebo/no specific therapy significantly reduced CMV disease (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80). However, CIs were wide (0.11 to 0.80), statistical significance was moderate (P = 0.02), and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity among studies (I = 54%): two studies favoured pre-emptive therapy and two large studies favoured prophylaxis. Similarly, no significant difference was identified in the risk for CMV disease between pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.44); CIs were wide, indicating considerable imprecision, and there was significant heterogeneity (I = 63%).</P>
<P>Data for outcomes other than CMV disease were more limited. Particularly, we found that there was failure to report outcomes relating to adverse effects. We also found that low participant numbers and few events increased imprecision.</P>
<P>Only two studies stratified CMV disease and infection by the high risk serostatus D+/R- (<LINK REF="STD-Khoury-2006-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 2006 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2008 Kidney</LINK>). Only 49 patients were available from these two studies which prevented comprehensive analysis. Such subset analysis required a larger sample size to enable accurate assessment of this high risk group.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was considered to be low or very low because of small numbers of enrolled participants, few events, significant heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and inadequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>The search criteria, analysis, and data extraction were performed to a high standard (see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>). Four reviewers independently performed the analysis and data extraction; any conflict was resolved by an independent party. This further decreased the risk of bias for the review. The search strategy for the review was thorough. The Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register includes complete listings of current studies and is regularly updated to include new studies and additional reports of existing studies from journals and conference reports.</P>
<P>It is possible that some studies may have been missed where the study report has only been published in abstract form in conference proceedings, which have not yet been handsearched.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK> conducted a systematic review comparing pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis in solid organ transplants, and consistent with our review findings, also found no significant difference in the risk of CMV disease, graft loss, acute rejection and mortality between pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis. However, our review identified a 58% reduced risk of leucopenia in the pre-emptive therapy rationale which was not identified by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK>. The studies included in this review for pre-emptive treatment versus prophylaxis were mostly the same as those analysed by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK>; the exceptions were two Chinese studies included by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK> that were excluded from our review on the basis that they were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2008 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tian-2005-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 2005 Kidney</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK> did not include either the <LINK REF="STD-Gerna-2008-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Gerna 2008 Liver</LINK> transplant study in children or the liver transplant study by <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1994-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1994 Liver</LINK> which were included in this review. This would account for numerical variations between these reviews, although much of the statistical outcomes remain the same.</P>
<P>A recent commentary on CMV in solid organ transplant recipients also suggested the need for more studies comparing pre-emptive therapy with prophylaxis to identify if pre-emptive therapy may increase the risk of the indirect effects of CMV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>). This is in agreement with our findings where several studies did not report on outcomes relating to indirect effects of CMV infection. Our findings are consistent with recent guidelines from the British Transplantation Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>), Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2009</LINK>) and Caring for Australians with Renal Impairment (<LINK REF="REF-CARI-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CARI 2010</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-01-16 19:21:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified no significant differences in efficacy between pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis for preventing CMV disease, graft loss, and death in solid organ transplant recipients. However, study data remain sparse. The ability to ascertain true benefits and harms remains problematic when compared with prophylaxis due to heterogeneity between study results together with low sample sizes and event rates leading to imprecision.</P>
<P>Pre-emptive therapy has shown benefits over placebo and standard care. This review has identified an increased risk of CMV infection with pre-emptive therapy, which may have deleterious impacts on the indirect effects of CMV infection including graft loss, acute rejection, and infections other than CMV compared with prophylaxis. While no significant differences in meta-analyses could be demonstrated for these outcomes, heterogeneity around the results indicate that differences cannot be excluded. Furthermore, four year follow-up data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2008-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2008 Kidney</LINK> suggest that graft loss may be higher in patients treated with prophylaxis compared with pre-emptive therapy. Four year follow-up data for the much larger <LINK REF="STD-Witzke-2012-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Witzke 2012 Kidney</LINK> study are awaited.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need to standardise testing frequency and cut off levels for positive tests used in the surveillance testing for CMV infection which could reduce variability between institutions and in studies. A standardised method should test patients frequently (especially within the first six months post-transplant) and should have a low threshold for detection. The results should be immediately available to enable therapy to be commenced as soon as possible after the surveillance threshold is exceeded.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-16 19:23:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the heterogeneity of results in currently available studies, further well designed and adequately powered studies are required to compare three or more months of prophylactic therapy using an anti-CMV viral medication with pre-emptive therapy for patients who develop viraemia. Such studies should be powered to enable assessment of direct and indirect effects of CMV infection, adverse effects of medications and resource utilisation have sufficient follow-up to assess graft loss and mortality, and include standardised thresholds and frequency of testing for CMV viraemia.</P>
