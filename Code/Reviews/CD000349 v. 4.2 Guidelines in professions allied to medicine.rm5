<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Professions allied to medicine, such as nurses, midwives and dietiticians, can effectively incorporate clinical guidelines to improve patient care</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The issuing of clinical guidelines to nurses, midwives, dieticians and other health-care professionals allied to medicine may reduce variations in practice and improve patient care. This review found that, despite limited research, there is some evidence that guidelines can improve care and that professional roles can be substituted effectively, for instance a nurse can perform the function of a physician in certain circumstances. Such interventions offer the possibility of reduced costs but further research is needed in all areas of this topic.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Clinical practice guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in practice and to promote the delivery of evidence-based health care.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To identify and assess the effects of studies of the introduction of clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visiting), midwifery and other professions allied to medicine. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, MEDLINE (1975 to 1996), EMBASE, Cinahl and Sigle to 1996, the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1994 to 1996), DHSS-Data (1983 to 1996), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (1994 to 1996) and reference lists of articles. We also hand searched the journal Quality in Health Care, made personal contact with content experts and contacted libraries identified by an expert panel.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses of the introduction of interventions comparing 1. Clinical guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus no guidelines; 2. Guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus guidelines plus alternative dissemination and/or implementation strategies; and 3. (post hoc) Guidelines used by professions allied to medicine versus standard physician care. The participants were nurses, midwives and other professions allied to medicine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighteen studies were included involving more than 467 health care professionals. The reporting of study methods was inadequate for all studies. In all but one study, nurses were the targeted professional group; one study was aimed solely at dieticians. The various behaviours targeted included the management of hypertension, low back pain and hyperlipidaemia. Nine studies were identified for comparison 1. Three out of five studies observed improvements in at least some processes of care and six out of eight studies observed improvements in outcomes of care. Only one study included a formal economic evaluation, with equivocal findings. Three studies were identified for comparison 2 but it was difficult to draw firm conclusions because of poor methods. Six studies were identified for comparison 3 (post hoc). These studies generally supported the hypothesis that there was no difference between care given by nurses using clinical guidelines and standard physician care. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some evidence that guideline-driven care is effective in changing the process and outcome of care provided by professions allied to medicine. However, caution is needed in generalising findings to other professions and settings.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-06 12:52:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical guidelines are 'systematically developed statements to assist practitioner decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances' (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>). Guidelines are used to reduce inappropriate variations in practice and to promote the delivery of high-quality evidence-based health care (<LINK REF="REF-CRAG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRAG 1993</LINK>). However, most of the emphasis in the literature has been on guidelines solely or principally in the medical domain; for example, Grimshaw and Russell (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 1993</LINK>) undertook a systematic review of the effects of introducing clinical guidelines for medical staff. A preliminary search of the literature in relation to clinical practice guidelines in nursing, midwifery and professions allied to medicine has revealed systematically developed guidelines in community pharmacy (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 1995</LINK>) and dietetics (<LINK REF="REF-Flanel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanel 1995</LINK>). Early examples have also been found where medical protocols were implemented by nurses for dysuria, frequent urination and vaginal discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975a</LINK>) and for low back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975b" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975b</LINK>). In both studies, protocols were evaluated using patient outcome measures, rather than compliance with the protocols by health professionals.</P>
<P>To date, there has been no systematic review of the effectiveness of dissemination and implementation strategies for guidelines targeting nurses, midwives and professions allied to medicine. In the USA, guideline dissemination appears to be via 'massive distribution' to professional and lay groups (<LINK REF="REF-Colling-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colling 1994</LINK>), despite evidence that dissemination by publication or direct mailing are the least successful strategies (eg <LINK REF="REF-Grol-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1992</LINK>). It cannot be assumed that those strategies evaluated for medicine will transfer to other groups of health care professionals that have a different educational preparation and management structure.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-11-12 17:48:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. To identify rigorous evaluations of the introduction of clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visiting), midwifery and other professions allied to medicine. Both hospital and community sectors were included.</P>
<P>2. To determine the effectiveness and efficiency of introducing clinical practice guidelines targeting nursing, midwifery and professions allied to medicine to promote improved professional practice and patient outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison groups were as follows:</HEADING>
<P>Comparison 1: guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategy versus no guidelines;</P>
<P>Comparison 2: guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategy A versus guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategy B;</P>
<P>During the review, a subset of studies was identified which examined the ability of clinical guidelines to enable role substitution (in all cases substituting nurses for doctors). These studies evaluate an organisational intervention and have a different objective to studies evaluating the effectiveness of introducing guidelines on improving patient outcomes. However, as these studies comprised rigorous evaluations of guidelines by nurses, they were included as a post-hoc subset in our review.</P>
<P>Comparison 3: guidelines (used by professions allied to medicine) versus no guidelines (standard physician care), ie skill substitution studies.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 17:47:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), interrupted time series (ITS) studies and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies . (See EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for METHODS USED IN REVIEWS for complete definitions of study designs.)</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The following professions were included in the review: nursing, midwifery, health visiting, chiropody, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, clinical psychology, pharmacy and radiography. For brevity, all professions included in the review are subsequently referred to as 'professions allied to medicine'.</P>
<P>On detailed reading and data extraction of a number of papers which had initially met our inclusion criteria, some problems were identified. These included the inability to separate the effects of guidelines on the behaviour of professionals allied to medicine from the impact on the behaviour of other health professionals. A number of papers were found where guidelines were aimed at a multi-disciplinary team. We decided that if processes or outcomes for professions allied to medicine were not evaluated separately, 50% or more recipients of the guideline had to be professionals allied to medicine for the paper to be included. Papers that initially appeared to meet our inclusion criteria but which were subsequently excluded for these reasons are recorded in the excluded studies table.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We adopted the Institute of Medicine's (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>) definition of clinical guidelines as 'systematically developed statements to assist practitioner decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances'. In recognition of the variety of terms used for guidelines, we did not insist that the term 'guideline' was explicitly used, as long as the intervention in question implicitly met the definition. Synonyms for clinical guidelines included 'protocol', 'standard' and 'clinical pathway'. We were interested in all types of guideline, not simply those based on evidence.<BR/>
<BR/>To be eligible for inclusion, a study had to be a rigorous evaluation of the introduction of a clinical guideline on the behaviour of professionals allied to medicine and/or on patient outcomes. We included studies that evaluated an entire or identified component of a guideline aimed at these professions and that specified which part(s) of the guideline should be implemented by the profession(s) in question. We considered not only those studies on guidelines developed by the target profession for their own use, but also those where the guideline was developed and/or disseminated by another professional group but where the targeted behaviour was that of professionals allied to medicine. We included all types of dissemination and implementation strategies. (See EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for METHODS USED IN REVIEWS for details of the EPOC intervention taxonomy.)</P>
<P>'Skill substitution' studies, evaluating the ability of guidelines to facilitate role substitution, were included. </P>
<P>Studies evaluating discharge planning or case management protocols were included only if they included a list of actions for patient groups, rather than for individual patients.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Studies were included if they reported objective assessments of the process or outcome of care provided by professionals allied to medicine, for example on patient assessment or on the provision of appropriate interventions. Studies that examined staff satisfaction and knowledge were included only if they also examined the behaviour of professionals allied to medicine or patient outcome. Studies measuring economic outcomes (ie anything about the costs of guideline implementation, especially costs versus benefits) were included.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 17:47:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Search strategies were developed using the methodological component of the EPOC search strategy (see EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for METHODS USED IN REVIEWS) and expanding the section on clinical guidelines. Search terms included: 'practice guideline', 'health planning guidelines', 'care map' and 'professional standard'.</P>
<P>A cut-off date of 1975 was imposed because MEDLINE (the only database used in this review going back prior to 1975) does not contain abstracts before this year. Because of the nature of the review, searching on title only would have resulted in retrieving potentially hundreds of papers not meeting our inclusion criteria; the likely yield was judged by the research team not to merit the resources and expenditure required by the task.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Each relevant study was assessed for inclusion in the review independently by two reviewers. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers working independently. Reviewers did not always work in the same pairs. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by the data extractors; those that could not be resolved easily were referred to the remaining authors.</P>
<P>Where separate papers reported on different aspects of the same study (for example, one paper describing the methodology and one the findings, or one exploring the impact of guidelines on professional behaviour and another the effect on patient outcome), they were treated as one study and only one data extraction template was completed. Where separate papers reported on a pilot study and a main study of the impact of the same guideline, we extracted both separately only if they reported on a separate sample of patients; otherwise, we extracted data from the paper reporting the main study only.</P>
<P>Time constraints precluded following up data missing from papers by contacting authors; this will be undertaken prior to the next revision of the review.</P>
<P>As the heterogeneity of clinical areas, design of studies, source and format of interventions, outcomes measured and participating health professionals was substantial, a meta-analysis would have had little practical meaning. We therefore opted to report the effects on the process and outcome of care in the same way that they were reported in the original papers. Where reported analyses were inadequate, for example where the original authors did not report the statistical significance of their findings, or where a more powerful analysis of time-series data was possible (eg test for trend), we re-analysed the data presented in the source papers.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified 18 studies which met our inclusion criteria (see included studies table). A further 13 were initially believed to meet the criteria but were rejected at the data extraction phase for various reasons, the most common being fundamental methodological flaws or the failure to separate the impact of the guideline on professions allied to medicine from that on other professions (see excluded studies table).</P>
<P>All but one of the identified studies evaluated the introduction of guidelines targeting nurses. In five of these studies, physicians were also targeted (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zeler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>). The study by Shaffer and Wexler (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>) evaluated the introduction of a multi-disciplinary guideline targeting a lipid clinic team comprising nurses, pharmacists, psychologists and dieticians. The study by Franz and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>) evaluated the introduction of guidelines for dieticians. </P>
<P>Targeted behaviours were nutrition therapy for non-insulin-dependent diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>), infection control (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>), management of labour (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>), management of dysuria, frequency and vaginal discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975a</LINK>), management of low back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975b" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975b</LINK>), management of headache (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1976</LINK>), vaccinations (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>), management of hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>), referral for X-ray (<LINK REF="STD-Klassen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 1993</LINK>), management of intravenous therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>), test ordering, referral, recording and changes in treatment (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>), reduction in fall rates (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>), discharge planning (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>), catheter practices (<LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>). lipid lowering (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>), identification of battered women (<LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>) and management of post-operative bleeding after cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Zeler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zeler 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Study settings were in-patient care (nine studies), out-patient/ambulatory care (seven studies) and emergency room (one study). </P>
<P>Twelve studies were based in the United States of America, two in Australia, two in Hong Kong, one in Canada and one in the United Kingdom.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological characteristics of each study are shown in the included studies table. We identified 13 RCTs. In three studies the unit of allocation was the health professional or provider unit (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>) had a unit of analysis error: the unit of randomisation was the provider or ward, but the unit of analysis was the patient. Such unit of analysis errors artificially increase the precision of the study and may lead to misleadingly significant findings.</P>
<P>There were ten RCTs where the unit of allocation was the patient (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975b" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zeler 1992</LINK>). There were major differences in methodological quality; the proportion of quality criteria met ranged from five out of seven (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>) to one out of seven (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>). Just over half of the studies (7/13) had good follow up, blindly assessed outcomes and reliable measurement of at least some key outcomes. A minority of studies reported method of randomisation (done in 4/13).</P>
<P>We identified two CBA studies where a second site acted as the control (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>). In the Larson study (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>), five units in a single hospital participated; two received the intervention and three served as controls. No data were presented about the comparability of intervention and control sites; baseline measurement showed significant differences on one parameter likely to influence post-intervention differences (accuracy of recording of last intravenous infusion). At least some outcomes were measured reliably but none were assessed blindly. Protection against contamination appeared adequate. The analysis is almost certainly inappropriate: there is no explanation as to how the dependent variable was calculated and clustering of the data has probably not been taken into account.</P>
<P>In the Shaffer study (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>), two clinics (one intervention, one control) within the same medical centre participated. No data were presented on the similarity of the clinics; patients selected for the study from each clinic were matched according to age and cholesterol level. Outcomes measured were reliable and were assessed blindly. As the lipid clinic team worked only in the intervention clinic, it is likely there was successful protection against contamination between clinics.</P>
<P>Three studies were ITS designs (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>); quality criteria met ranged from four out of nine (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>) to one out of nine (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>). In the French study (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>) the intervention appeared independent of other changes during the study period; in the Mitchell study (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>) no details were provided as to whether this was or was not the case. In the Tilden study (<LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>), where the targeted behaviour was identification of battered women, the authors state that media coverage and an initiative by hospital administration (aimed at all staff) to increase the level of detail in patient documentation may have intensified the effect of the intervention. No ITS study had sufficient data points before and after the intervention; only one study (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>) did a formal test for trend. All ITS studies were prone to detection bias. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>) data collection methods were identical before and after the intervention. However in the Mitchell study (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>), pre-intervention data on fall rates were collected from retrospective analysis of fall incident forms, while prospective data were collected by adding a 'falls reporting document' to the incident form. As this appeared to be part of the intervention, this directly influenced data collection. Whether the intervention directly influenced data collection in the two other ITS studies is not clear. Outcomes were not assessed blindly in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>); in the remaining two studies it is not clear whether this was the case. In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>) was information provided about the completeness of the data set: all adult female trauma patients were included. No ITS study measured outcomes reliably.</P>

Of these, four were RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>), three were ITS studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>) and two were CBA studies (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies assessed the effect of guidelines in terms of the process of care. Significant changes in at least some of the assessed processes of care were identified in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tilden 1987</LINK>). For example, Frigoletto's study (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>) of the management of labour by nurse-midwives found significant differences in practices relating to the management of labour between the active management protocol and usual care groups. In the active management group, the frequency of vaginal examinations was significantly higher (mean interval 1.6 hours versus 2.5 hours for standard care group), significantly more women received oxytocin to hasten labour (70% versus 56%) and significantly fewer women requested and received epidural anaesthesia (54% versus 64%). The study by Larson observed improvements in process of care, however these are difficult to interpret given the problems with the analysis (see Methodological Quality).</P>
<P>Eight studies measured outcomes of care; statistically significant differences in favour of the intervention group were found for at least some outcomes of care in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-1989" TYPE="STUDY">French 1989</LINK>). However, the findings from several of these studies were equivocal, with no significant change being noted in other outcome variables assessed. For some studies, the observed change in what appeared to be the primary outcome measure was non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>) included a formal economic evaluation. This study assessed the effect of medical nutrition therapy for non-insulin-dependent diabetics administered according to practice guidelines with medical nutrition therapy administered in line with standard care. Findings were suggestive of a cost-efficiency advantage in favour of the control group when one outcome measure (glycated haemoglobin) was considered, but no difference when an alternative outcome measure (fasting plasma glucose level) was examined. The studies described by Naylor (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 1994</LINK>) and Larson and Hargiss (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>) suggest that direct health care costs are decreased by guideline-driven care, but these authors do not provide sufficient data to ascertain whether these cost savings are offset by the cost of guideline dissemination and implementation.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparison 2: guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategy A versus guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategy B.</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>) explicitly compared two or more dissemination or implementation strategies. All were RCTs. Within these studies, the interventions were heterogeneous, precluding combining the findings from two or more studies. Seto et al (<LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>) in their evaluation of opinion leaders and in-service lectures as methods of disseminating a guideline on urinary catheter care to nurses, compared three groups: one received guidelines, lectures and opinion leaders (A), one received guidelines and opinion leaders (B) and one received guidelines and lectures (C). Performance improved in all three groups, however improvements were greater in groups A and B. There was a unit of analysis error and it is not possible to determine whether these improvements were statistically significant.</P>
<P>Herman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>) found that a 'nurse protocol' intervention led to positive changes in the process of care (offer of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine). There were three comparison groups: all received guidelines, educational materials and lectures, group two received additional provider and patient education at each clinic visit and group three received an additional protocol (which comprised a flowchart record incorporating the recommendations of the guideline and a redefinition of the nurse's role). They (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>) found that an active dissemination strategy (involving provider education) had a minor effect on professional behaviour in the group receiving only guidelines, educational materials and lectures. The impact of the guideline on outcomes of care was also assessed: a difference between intervention and control groups was found, but in the opposite direction to that which was expected: the percentage of patients declining immunisation increased in the intervention period to 13.2% in the prevention team group; 5.8% in the patient education group and 5.9% in the control group. However, there was a unit of analysis error in this study, hence it is not possible to say whether these findings are statistically significant.</P>
<P>McDonald (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>) compared the effect of patient-specific computerised prompts at the time of consultation, computerised prompts plus bibliographic citations and standard care on the use and follow up of medications. However, the results for nurses are presented with the two intervention groups combined so it is not possible to compare the two methods of implementation. With the computerised prompts and computerised prompts plus citations groups combined, the intervention did not appear to lead to a significant change in nurses' behaviour; this finding was contrary to that for physicians in the same study. It is possible that this negative finding was due to a lack of power to detect a difference (n=five nurses).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparison 3: skill-substitution studies.</HEADING>
<P>In the remaining six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1975b" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1975b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klassen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klassen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zeler 1992</LINK>) the performances of nurses operating in accordance with a guideline were compared with 'standard care', generally provided by a physician. All six studies were RCTs. The aim was skill substitution, generally in the interests of greater efficiency.</P>
<P>In these studies, a finding of no significant difference or of a positive effect in favour of the profession allied to medicine would suggest that the intervention was effective. The findings from all six studies that examined the processes and all five that examined outcomes of care generally support the hypothesis of no difference. Whilst appropriate sample size calculations were not reported in any study, with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1988</LINK>), sample sizes were probably large enough to detect clinically significant differences.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Findings from the 18 studies identified provide some evidence that guideline-driven care can be effective in changing the process and outcome of care provided by professions allied to medicine. Significant improvements in the outcome of care were found in seven out of nine studies comparing the introduction of guidelines to a no guideline control. The three studies comparing two or more dissemination and implementation strategies were compromised by a small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1980</LINK>) or unit of analysis errors (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 1991</LINK>). As a result it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these studies. The findings from the six studies that examined the ability of clinical guidelines to enable role substitution generally support the effectiveness of this intervention. </P>
<P>Some caution is needed in interpreting the findings from our review and in generalising these findings to other professions and settings due to the poor methods observed in most studies (see Methodological quality) and the study settings. The majority of the studies were carried out in a single site, focused on only one profession and often involved very small numbers of health professionals (in several cases, only one nurse). The possibility that the findings were specific to the setting or to the individual(s) cannot be ruled out. In some cases, the health professionals who were studied were selected specifically because of their enthusiasm or expertise (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>); the guidelines may have been less effective in the hands of less committed or less highly qualified or experienced staff. As many of the authors themselves recognise (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 1995</LINK>), the majority of the studies were threatened by the Hawthorne effect, as health professionals were aware that their performance was being assessed. The timing of the assessment of process and outcome may also have had an impact: the studies we identified did not, in general, provide sufficient information to assess whether any observed changes in performance were sustained after the initial impetus of guideline dissemination.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Target professions</HEADING>
<P>All but one study was aimed at nurses. No studies evaluating the effectiveness of guidelines were found for several professions included in the review (eg physiotherapy; occupational therapy). These conclusions, therefore, relate mainly to nursing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Guideline dissemination and implementation</HEADING>
<P>Findings from this review provide some evidence that guideline-driven care can be effective in changing the process and outcome of care provided by professions allied to medicine. There is currently insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the different dissemination and implementation strategies. We recommend that future dissemination and implementation activities should be informed by theoretical perspectives (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1992</LINK>) and by evidence of those strategies shown to be most effective in relation to changing doctors' behaviour.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Research into guideline development, dissemination and implementation strategies</HEADING>
<P>The studies included in this review provide only limited evidence of the relative merits of alternative dissemination and implementation strategies. More research is required into the relative effectiveness of these strategies in relation to professions allied to medicine. Studies are needed in which two or more strategies for guideline development, dissemination or implementation are examined in the same population.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study design and reporting</HEADING>
<P>In studying professional behavioural change, the strongest evidence is provided by RCTs in which the units of randomisation and allocation are the provider. This design should be considered as the 'gold standard' in designing future studies of the effectiveness of guidelines. Where it is not feasible to randomise by provider, care should be taken to minimise the risk of contamination. Potential confounding factors and sources of bias should be identified explicitly. Ideally, these studies will include a qualitative component to provide answers about not only whether, but how and why an intervention works.</P>
<P>Reports of study design and results should include sufficient detail to allow a 'quality assessment' of the study. The unit of randomisation should be the same as the unit of analysis to avoid artificially increasing the precision of the study and misleadingly small confidence intervals. The primary 'outcome measures' (ie the processes or outcomes of care expected to change as a result of the intervention) should be clearly identified. The size of difference considered to be 'clinically significant' should be stated a priori and the study should be powered accordingly. Reports of the study should include details of sample size calculations. Where possible, an intention-to-treat analysis should be carried out; in any case, the number of units of randomisation lost to follow up should be reported (separately for intervention and control groups).</P>
