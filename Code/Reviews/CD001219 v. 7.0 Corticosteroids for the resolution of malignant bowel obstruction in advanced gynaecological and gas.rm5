<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:23:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>Corticosteroids may reduce bowel obstruction for people with advanced gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer. Malignant bowel obstruction is fairly common in people with gastrointestinal (gut) cancer or ovarian cancer. It can lead to pain, vomiting, nausea, or complete constipation. Corticosteroids may lower inflammation and so help to reduce the obstruction especially if surgery is not considered to be suitable. The review found that corticosteroids may reduce bowel obstruction for people with these cancers, with a low rate of adverse effects. The treatment does not appear to affect survival rates compared to the placebo.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:12:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>This is an update of the review published in Issue 3, 1999. Gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers are common cancers. The incidence of associated malignant bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancers of these types is not known, and the best management of these patients is controversial. Inappropriate management may result in uncontrolled (faeculant) vomiting, pain and distress. Management of the symptoms can include palliative surgery, nasogastric tube suction together with intravenous fluids, or pharmacological means, such as corticosteroids. There is uncertainty regarding both the efficacy and possible harmful effects of corticosteroids, and also the most effective type, dose/dosing regime, route and period of administration.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:12:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>To locate, appraise and summarise evidence from scientific studies on intestinal obstruction due to advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer, in order to assess efficacy of corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A comprehensive list of all studies was provided by an extensive search of the electronic databases, relevant journals, reference lists, the grey literature, contact with investigators and other search strategies outlined in the methods. Date of last search conducted in February 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:12:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>As the review concentrates on the 'best evidence' available of the role of corticosteroids in malignant bowel obstruction due to advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer the inclusion criteria were kept fairly broad so as to include all studies relevant to the question.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>Data extraction forms were used to collect data from the studies included in the review. The data was checked by a secondary searcher to reduce error.</P>
<P>A qualitative analysis was performed of the dichotomous data of resolution of obstruction and death at one month, obtained from the randomised controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo. Both fixed and random effect models were used. Number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) was derived from the odds ratio. Kaplan-Meier survival curves from individual patient data were also analysed. Studies of lower methodological quality were assessed in a qualitative manner.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:13:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>No new included or excluded trials were found for this update beyond the three unpublished, randomised, placebo, double blind controlled trials and seven published (prospective and retrospective) trials which were previously considered eligible.</P>
<P>Using only the randomised trials (89 patients), there is a trend, which is not statistically significant, for the resolution of bowel obstruction using corticosteroids. There is no statistically significant difference in mortality at one month, nor in the Kaplan-Meier curves, which describe the survival of patients on corticosteroids or placebo. Number needed to treat is six (three, infinity) i.e. six patients need to be treated with corticosteroids to resolve one episode of bowel obstruction. The results are robust to fixed and random effects models and to 'best' and 'worst case' scenarios on the missing data from patients. The morbidity associated with corticosteroids appears to be very low, though the quality of the data limits this conclusion. No other outcomes were available from the published data or from the authors.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:14:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>There is a trend for evidence that corticosteroids of dose range six to 16 mg dexamethasone given intravenously may bring about the resolution of bowel obstruction. Equally, the incidence of side effects in all the included studies is extremely low. Corticosteroids do not seem to affect the length of survival of these patients. Since the last version of this review, no new studies have been conducted. No new studies have been identified for this update and the conclusions are not altered.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:19:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-27 14:15:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>This review is an update of the same previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 3, 1999). Gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers are common cancers with gastrointestinal being the most common overall (with an incidence of 112/100,000) and ovarian the fourth most common cancer in women (with an incidence of 17/100,000) within the United Kingdom. Up to 26,000 men and women and 4000 women a year respectively die from these diseases. Other gynaecological cancers cause the death of a further 2300 women each year (<LINK REF="REF-CRC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRC 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of malignant intestinal obstruction in these groups of patients is generally not known. Many retrospective studies have estimated that this can occur in five to 51% of patients with gynaecological malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dvoretsky-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dvoretsky 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dvoretsky-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dvoretsky 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripamonti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripamonti 1993</LINK>) and in ten to 28% of patients with gastrointestinal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Ripamonti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripamonti 1993</LINK>). These figures, however, are in highly selected groups of patients, and different diagnostic criteria are often used. The true incidence may be even higher.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management of bowel obstruction</HEADING>
<P>Prior to a seminal paper by <LINK REF="REF-Baines-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baines 1985</LINK>, treatment for bowel obstruction due to malignancy was either palliative surgery or, if surgery was not possible, nasogastric tube suction together with intravenous fluids. Both methods meant that the patient remained in hospital, often for prolonged periods of time, with their symptoms inadequately addressed. Baines <I>et al. </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Baines-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baines 1985</LINK>) demonstrated, however, that the symptoms of bowel obstruction in those patients where surgery was not possible could be managed by pharmacological means. In such patients they demonstrated an improvement in generalised abdominal pain, colic, nausea and vomiting by using regular analgesics, anti-spasmodics, and anti-emetics. Since this study, others have produced similar results in different settings but often using different medication.</P>
<P>On admission to hospital initial management is to resuscitate the patient using intravenous fluids and electrolytes and keeping them 'nil by mouth' to reduce vomiting. Analgesics and antiemetics are used to a varying extent in the hospital setting but are used more widely within the hospice and palliative care population. Nasogastric intubation, occasionally with continuous suction, is commonly performed within hospital with the aim of decompressing the stomach and reducing the risk of vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1991</LINK>). This conservative management of 'resting the bowel' can continue for three to nine days, if not longer, depending on the institution and it is estimated that between 12 to 29% of symptoms may resolve. Unfortunately, it is thought that symptoms recur in 32 to 45% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osteen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osteen 1980</LINK>). The patients in whom symptoms are not managed, or inadequately addressed may deteriorate with uncontrolled (faeculant) vomiting, pain and distress and will eventually die in this most distressing fashion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Role and use of corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>The possible role of corticosteroids in bowel obstruction is complex and not completely known. Corticosteroids act as both anti-emetics (<LINK REF="REF-Allan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allan 1993</LINK>) and co-analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Twycross-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twycross 1994</LINK>) and so may be able to palliate the symptoms of nausea, vomiting and pain in bowel obstruction. It is also thought that, in addition, the anti-inflammatory activity of corticosteroids may reduce peri-tumour inflammatory oedema associated with a malignant lesion thereby helping to resolve the obstruction and leading to consequent symptom relief (<LINK REF="REF-Ripamonti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripamonti 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Small groups of patients have been reported as benefiting from corticosteroids but these reports are not within the context of randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Fainsinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fainsinger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripamonti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripamonti 1994</LINK>). The problem remains that bowel obstruction is a dynamic process, and symptoms may improve spontaneously over days. The decision to use corticosteroids will often reflect the personal preference of the physician and the institution in which they work.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are often given for short periods of time especially when the patient first presents, often with an initial loading dose and then reduced in as short a period of time as possible to stop. This is done in order to limit the known side effects which include oral candidiasis, proximal weakness, cushingoid habitus (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1997</LINK>), gastric irritation and predisposition to haemorrhage and perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Ellershaw-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellershaw 1994</LINK>) (especially in an already-compromised bowel). The route of administration varies; many reports include oral, intravenous and subcutaneous as well as rectal administration.</P>
<P>Whatever the mechanism there remains no information in the literature within the context of a systematic review discussing whether corticosteroids are able to resolve intestinal obstruction and so improve the symptoms, and if so, the most effective type, dose or dosing regime, route of administration, or for what period of time these agents should be given.</P>
<P>Like many treatments for rare diseases, bowel obstruction is managed and treated empirically by offering an initial trial, sometimes with a loading dose, continuing treatment for as long as possible in those patients that seem to respond. The best management of this group of patients is controversial. There is uncertainty regarding both benefits and possible harmful effects of corticosteroids, and there are marked variations in clinical practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale of a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>In a patient with progressive cancer where there is no 'curative intent', the aim of all treatment is to improve the patient's quality of life, considering all available and appropriate means.</P>
<P>Currently, patients with bowel obstruction remain in hospital for long periods of time due to uncertainty in both the diagnosis and management strategies, especially so if the patient remains symptomatic. The cost of numerous trials of unsuccessful medications and increased medical and nursing input is significant, as is the emotional distress to the carers and family. If appropriate symptom management is instigated rapidly, a patient's symptoms can be controlled satisfactorily, and discharge home with appropriate care is facilitated. Provision of further palliative care services can then take place in the home or hospice environment.</P>
<P>The ability of individual clinicians to appraise all the available clinical evidence would mean potential cost benefits and efficiency gains with:</P>
<OL>
<LI>improved symptom control management and better quality of life for patients;</LI>
<LI>improved standard management;</LI>
<LI>shorter stay in hospital, with more appropriate use of resources.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This was a re-visit of the literature and the original primary objective of this systematic review was to systematically evaluate all known trials of corticosteroids in any language, published or unpublished, to determine their efficacy in the treatment of bowel obstruction caused by gastrointestinal or gynaecological cancer. A secondary aim was to investigate the sources of heterogeneity which may influence the outcomes, and whether they are important in the interpretation of results and overall conclusions reached.</P>
<P>Potential causes of heterogeneity include previous treatments of chemotherapy and surgery, previous steroid use (including type and dose of steroids used) and whether the 'amount' of disease is important.</P>
<P>With regard to clinical efficacy of corticosteroids, the specific objectives were:<BR/>1. primary outcome - to assess the effects of corticosteroids on the clinical resolution of bowel obstruction within ten days of presentation of symptoms;<BR/>2. secondary outcomes:<BR/>a) to determine whether corticosteroids were effective in the resolution of symptoms of: <BR/>i. pain<BR/>ii. nausea<BR/>iii. vomiting<BR/>b) to determine whether corticosteroids reduce further episodes of bowel obstruction;<BR/>c) to determine whether corticosteroids increase or decrease mortality;<BR/>d) to determine whether corticosteroids increase or decrease morbidity;<BR/>e) to determine whether corticosteroids affect quality of life.</P>

<P>All records from each of the databases above was imported to the bibliographic package Reference Manager and merged into one core database where all titles, keywords and abstracts were inspected for relevance. Full text was obtained of all relevant articles. Where it was not possible to classify an article and reject it with certainty the full text of the article was obtained for further evaluation. A final list of potentially relevant articles was therefore created in Reference Manager.</P>
<P>This group of studies was assessed independently by two review authors (to increase validity) (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1987</LINK>) to the above inclusion criteria to judge which articles were to be included in the review. The reports were masked to journal publication, date, authorship and institution so as to produce more consistent results. Where differences occurred they were resolved by consensus and, when necessary, in consultation with a third review author. Agreement on which studies to include was measured by the kappa statistic to analyse the extent of inter-reviewer agreement. Justification for excluding studies was documented at this stage.</P>

<P>The evaluation of methodological quality of the trials included is as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Each randomised controlled trial was rated according to the quality of allocation concealment categories.<BR/>Category A: adequate concealment<BR/>Category B: uncertain, indication of adequate<BR/>Category C: inadequate concealment<BR/>Category D: not used</P>
<P>As this review concentrates on the 'best evidence', the quality of all the research found was graded using the criteria used by the NHS Executive in their Reviews on Commissioning Cancer Services (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1996</LINK>). Using the concept of a hierarchy of evidence, whereby some research methodologies are accepted as more robust than others, conclusions can be reached with more weight being given to well-conducted, controlled studies.</P>
<P>The quality of the research was graded using the following criteria:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Grade I (Strong evidence)</HEADING>
<P>Randomised controlled trial (RCT) or review of randomised controlled trials</P>
<P>IA: calculation of sample size and accurate and standard definition of outcome variables,</P>
<P>IB: accurate and standard definition of outcome variables,</P>
<P>IC: none of the above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Grade II (Fairly strong evidence)</HEADING>
<P>Prospective study with a comparison group (non-randomised controlled trial or good observation study)<BR/>IIA: calculation of sample size and accurate, standard definition of outcome variables and adjustment for the effects of important confounding variables,<BR/>IIB: one of the above,<BR/>IIC: none of the above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Grade III (Weak evidence)</HEADING>
<P>Retrospective study<BR/>IIIA: comparison group, calculation of sample size and accurate and standard definition of outcome variables,<BR/>IIIB: two of the above criteria,<BR/>IIIC: none of the above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Grade IV (Weak evidence)</HEADING>
<P>Cross-sectional study</P>
<P>These grades broadly correspond with the Clinical Outcomes of Group Categories of Evidence for use in clinical practice guidelines, where I = A, II or III = B, IV = C.</P>
<P>Differences in data extraction were resolved by referring back to the original article and utilizing consensus between the two review authors. Where necessary information was sought from the authors of the primary study for clarification or missing information.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data (i.e. resolution of bowel obstruction) was expressed as an odds ratio, and a common odds ratio was calculated with a number needed to treat being derived to help clarify the degree of benefit, and the uncertainty in each treatment was expressed using 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data (i.e. symptom scores) if present would have been converted to the weighted mean difference and an overall weighted mean difference would have been calculated and their standard errors.</P>
<P>Evidence of heterogeneity was sought between the relevant studies. If heterogeneity was demonstrated, the effect of differences in users, settings and primary and secondary outcome measures would have been explored. The Cochrane Review Manager software RevMan was used for estimation of overall treatment effects/meta-analysis of results. Both fixed and random effects models were used to calculate a weighted average of the treatment effects across the studies under review.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses as well as including study quality (quality of allocation concealment) would have included year of publication, type of outcome measure and random and fixed effects models if appropriate. Publication bias would have been tested for using funnel plots and by formal tests of heterogeneity if relevant.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-23 15:45:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>This is an update of the review and no new trials were found beyond those already searched on the initial review.</P>
<P>Two unpublished reports containing three randomised, placebo, double blind controlled trials (a total of 89 patients) were obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK>) by personal contact via the Association of Palliative Medicine and International Organisations of Palliative Medicines respectively. Seven retrospective and prospective reports were also located, (two reports via Medline, one report via Embase, two reports via hand searching and two reports via personal contact).</P>
<P>Details of these eligible reports are in the 'Characteristics of included studies'. Further information was requested from the authors of the unpublished randomised trials on the patients that dropped out or were lost to follow up and individual patient mortality data. Further data were obtained from both sets of authors.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All the randomised trials were double-blind, placebo controlled with allocation concealment of A. The quality scores (from the NHS criteria) for all the individual trials are reported in the notes section of 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>There was full agreement after discussion between the two review authors as to the data extracted and the methodological quality of the papers. We found no need to involve a third review author.</P>

<P>This search for this review was updated in February 2006 and no new included or excluded trials were found, however, the results presented and identified in the original review still stand as follows:</P>
<P>There was full agreement after discussion between the two review authors as to the articles to be included, the data extracted and the methodological quality of the papers. We found no need to involve a third review author.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity: clinical aspects</HEADING>
<P>The three unpublished randomised controlled trials had similar entry criteria in terms of population, intervention and outcome measures, and were able to be combined in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> had slightly more liberal entry criteria in that the patients could already have been on intravenous fluids, and those patients with previous episodes of obstruction were also allowed entry. It was also the smallest study in terms of size. Hardy (<LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK>) stratified the patients into those who had recently received chemotherapy and those who had not. <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> did not do this analysis. However, <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> used two different doses of corticosteroids but the analysis was only carried out as corticosteroids (on any dose) versus placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological aspects</HEADING>
<P>All the randomised trials were double-blind, placebo controlled with allocation concealment of A.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical aspects</HEADING>
<P>On inspection of the individual results, even though the point estimate of <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> was to the right of the line of no effect, the 95% confidence interval was extremely wide and the overall point estimates combined crossed all three lines. Using a formal test of statistical heterogeneity and the random effects model, the chi-squared result is 2.32, with two degrees of freedom. This is not significant at a 10% significance level (4.61). It must be remembered, however, that this is a test of low power using only three trials, and it is still possible that important differences between the studies are present. In view of the above, a random effects model was used to combine the results.</P>
<P>Due to the small number of trials, investigation of heterogeneity using meta-regression and subgroup analysis was not statistically appropriate. Equally, as all the randomised trials found were unpublished, it was not appropriate to perform a funnel plot.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The results of the meta-analysis for the three randomised controlled trials using the random effects model for the resolution of bowel obstruction using corticosteroids are demonstrated in meta-view. Using a random effects model, there is a point estimate of 0.51 (95% confidence intervals 0.19, 1.43). This is using all the available data which was extracted either from the papers or via the authors. Similar results are obtained in the same direction using a fixed effect model with similar 95% confidence intervals 0.49 (0.20, 1.25).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The results of the random effects meta-analysis for the three trials demonstrated that there is no evidence that corticosteroids have any effect on mortality at one month. There is no statistically significant difference between the Kaplan-Meier survival curves that compare survival since obstruction for corticosteroids and placebo (available on request from authors).</P>
<P>There were no data available on the resolution of symptoms, or data concerning further episodes of bowel obstruction nor quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was also carried out using the available data supplied, and then using the 'lost to follow up' or 'missing data' by assuming either the best possible or worst possible scenario. One patient from <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK> (1/25), one from <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> (1/14) and six patients from <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> (58 randomised, 52 results obtained) fitted this situation. There were six drop-outs/exclusions from the <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> study and even though an explanation was supplied (three died, one had a nasogastric tube inserted whilst in the trial, one patient had a different amount of corticosteroid given and one patient was randomised having already entered into the trial seven months earlier) no data were received about eventual outcomes.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis using a random effects model showed similar point estimates, though with smaller confidence intervals (95%); best scenario 0.50 (0.21, 1.2) and worst scenario 0.60 (0.21, 1.75).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number needed to treat</HEADING>
<P>The number needed to treat (as derived from the odds ratio using all the available data) is six (95% confidence intervals: three, infinity) - that is, six patients need to be treated with corticosteroids to resolve one episode of bowel obstruction. Using different probabilities for the numbers that spontaneously resolve from 33 to 66% does not change the final answer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Morbidity data</HEADING>
<P>From the morbidity data described in Hardy (<LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK>) it was not possible to distinguish morbidity due to the drug as opposed to the underlying condition. No data were supplied comparing placebo to the treatment group. Two drop-outs did, however, occur; in <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK> one patient suffered a pulmonary embolus on Day three, and in <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> one patient was withdrawn on Day two due to severe epigastric pain. This patient was on dexamethasone. The only definite side effect mentioned was, "some patients complained of an unpleasant peri-anal sensation" on receiving dexamethasone, which is a known side effect of this drug.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other reports</HEADING>
<P>Seven other studies of lower methodological quality were found. They were all graded IIIC apart from one, which was IIC. The majority of the reports looked at the prescription of corticosteroids together with all other therapeutic modalities in unselected, uncontrolled groups of patients with bowel obstruction and it is therefore not possible to attribute resolution of obstruction or symptoms to the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 15:46:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>All three randomised controlled trials were of good methodological quality, and in assessing the resolution of bowel obstruction (an inexact and soft clinical end point), all studies used blinded assessors which was important to limit bias. This updated review does not provide additional information on this treatment as no new relevant studies were included.</P>
<P>The strength of the results was also robust in terms of the statistical methods used (fixed or random effects) and the use of those patients who dropped out or were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>There is a trend for improvement in bowel obstruction for patients treated with corticosteroids; the line of no effect is crossed, however, and therefore this result is not statistically significant at a 95% level.<BR/>
<BR/>There was no evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on mortality at one month. Even though in some patients corticosteroids help bring about resolution of the obstruction it must be presumed that the corticosteroids do not act as an 'anti-cancer agent' and the patients deteriorate and die as a consequence of the volume of disease and associated metabolic and catabolic abnormalities that occur in all these patients.</P>
<P>Clearly, with the results that are available at present, more trials need to be performed. Problems, however, need to be overcome. The <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK>) trial was commenced in September 1987 and 25 patients were recruited in 36 months. <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> was commenced in January 1993, and 14 patients were recruited in 24 months. This study was terminated early due to non-recruitment. <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> recruited 58 patients in 29 months from 35 separate institutions. This clearly demonstrates the difficulty of undertaking studies in this population of patients.</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> demonstrated very similar results in terms of direction and amount, though <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> was in the opposite direction (with extremely wide confidence intervals). This could be due to chance, the small numbers in the trial, or due to changes in the entry criteria. The patients were allowed to have had previous obstructive episodes treated by steroids and to be on intravenous fluids. It may be that this group of patients who, by definition, may have previously been in obstruction and who responded to therapy (because they had all gone into the trial) were more unwell with more extensive disease and therefore less likely to respond. Unfortunately there were no data available on individual patients as to whether they had had previous episodes of obstruction and whether steroids had been prescribed or not.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other studies</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philip-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 1998</LINK>) specifically looked at the use of corticosteroids in bowel obstruction but these were of poor methodological quality with no objective criteria being used to grade symptoms. It was unclear whether a decrease in the symptoms (which did occur) in <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1990</LINK> and resolution of bowel obstruction were synonymous, as is suggested in this article. <LINK REF="STD-Philip-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 1998</LINK> also states that gastrointestinal function was definitely restored in 5/13 (38%) of patients and possibly in another 4/13 (31%) but in the absence of any control group this may reflect the natural history of the disease with spontaneous resolution of function. (In the randomised controlled trials of <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Laval-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laval 1998</LINK> spontaneous resolution occurred in 50, 60 and 33% respectively in the placebo-treated groups). Of interest in the paper by <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1990</LINK> is the fact that all the patients who were prescribed steroids, in their retrospective audit of 145 patients in total, had a low rate of side effects reported. This is also in agreement with all other retrospective studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No further evidence was identified through the re-running of this search strategy and therefore the following implications for practice still stand.</P>
<P>Using the meta-analysis results there is a trend for evidence that corticosteroids of dose range six to 16 mg dexamethasone given intravenously may bring about the resolution of bowel obstruction. Equally, the incidence of side effects in all the included studies is extremely low. The corticosteroids do not seem to affect length of survival but may palliate the symptoms extremely well and may enable the multidisciplinary team looking after the patient to address further issues regarding placement or treatment. The length of the therapeutic trial period is unknown, but it would seem sensible that if response has not been seen within four or five days, it is unlikely to work and it would seem reasonable to stop.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are an inexpensive intervention, easily administered by medical or nursing staff, which means that the patient can be treated in any environment (home, hospice or hospital) without difficulty. This is of obvious importance in many different countries, where large distances exist between the patient, who may be extremely symptomatic and unwell and therefore unable to travel, and the hospital centre. Equally, carers may be able to learn how to inject subcutaneously if required, depending on the locality and distance of the nearest medical/nursing staff. The common side effects that do occur, such as prophylaxis against ulcers and mouth care, can also be looked for and treated appropriately.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>No further trials have been conducted since the first publication of this review and therefore the original implications for research still stand.</P>
<P>In view of the overall results and the confidence intervals more research is still needed and should be focused on patient recruitment in trials in order to elicit a more precise result. It is presumed that by causing the resolution of bowel obstruction, corticosteroids also improve the symptoms and therefore 'quality of life' but this needs to be confirmed. Further trials should include quality of life measures as a primary outcome measure. Further controlled trials on the most effective type of corticosteroid, dose or dosing regime, route of administration, or to identify the period of time these agents should be given, also need to be performed. Further data also need to be collected prospectively on morbidity associated with corticosteroids, as undoubtedly the patients that live for a longer period of time (as seen from the survival curves) may begin to experience the significant side effects associated with high dosage of corticosteroids, even if only used for short periods of time.</P>
