<P>Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates.</P>
<P>Breast stimulation causes the womb to contract, though the mechanism remains unclear. It may increase levels of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contractions. It is a non-medical method allowing the woman greater control over the process of attempting to induce labour. The review of six trials (719 women) found insufficient research to evaluate the safety of breast stimulation in a high-risk population and until safety issues have been fully evaluated, it should not be considered for use in this group.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials (719 women) were included.</P>
<P>Analysis of trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention found a significant reduction in the number of women not in labour at 72 hours (62.7% versus 93.6%, relative risk (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74). This result was not significant in women with an unfavourable cervix. A major reduction in the rate of postpartum haemorrhage was reported (0.7% versus 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.87). No significant difference was detected in the caesarean section rate (9% versus 10%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.12) or rates of meconium staining. There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation. Three perinatal deaths were reported (1.8% versus 0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 147.77). </P>
<P>When comparing breast stimulation with oxytocin alone the analysis found no difference in caesarean section rates (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18). No difference was detected in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours (58.8% versus 25%, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54) or rates of meconium staining. There were four perinatal deaths (17.6% versus 5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 30.88). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates. Until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be used in high-risk women. Further research is required to evaluate its safety, and should seek data on postpartum haemorrhage rates, number of women not in labour at 72 hours and maternal satisfaction.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-15 16:16:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detail on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published generic protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>
<P>Breast stimulation as a means of labour induction allows women greater control over the induction process and has the advantage of being a natural and inexpensive non-medical method. Observational data have demonstrated a link between stimulation of both breasts (bilateral stimulation) and uterine hyperstimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Lenke-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenke 1984</LINK>). As a result of observed uterine hyperstimulation randomised controlled trials have studied breast massage or nipple stimulation of one breast at a time (unilateral stimulation). Breast stimulation has historically been used to induce and augment labour in many different cultures. European medical texts of the 18th and 19th century report on its use for the management of protracted labour (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1999</LINK>). Whilst the actual mechanism by which breast stimulation results in cervical changes is not known, it is known to cause uterine contractions, and has been recommended for contraction stress tests (<LINK REF="REF-Huddleston-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huddleston 1984</LINK>). It has been suggested that breast stimulation results in the production of endogenous oxytocin in both pregnant and non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Amico-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amico 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensson 1989</LINK>), however no direct relationship between oxytocin levels and intrapartum uterine response to breast stimulation has been clearly demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Christensson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seoud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seoud 1993</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine from the best available evidence, the effectiveness and safety of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no intervention or other methods of induction of labour.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2009-09-24 16:13:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Clinical trials comparing breast stimulation for cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction (<I>see</I> 'Methods of the review'); the trials included some form of random allocation to either group; and they reported one or more of the prestated outcomes. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Pregnant women due for third trimester induction of labour, carrying a viable fetus.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses were (<I>see</I> list below): previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Breast stimulation either by self stimulation through massage or by a mechanical method compared with placebo/no treatment or any other method above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses were limited to the primary outcomes:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this was unlikely. Composite outcomes also provide heightened sensitivity to a change in the incidence of these rare events. The incidence of individual components was explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction.</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side-effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1999</LINK>). In the reviews we used the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with FHR changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different groups of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in these reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 27. Each primary review included comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 27) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) will include only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2), or placebo (1).

<P>The primary reviews will be analysed by the following subgroups:</P>
<OL>

<LI>nulliparity or multiparity;</LI>
<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The trials included in the review were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (<I>see</I> above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous review authors in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>We examined performance bias with regard to whom was blinded in the trials i.e. participant, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. We sought details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they meet the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the authors of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>We extracted data from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual authors for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the Review Manager software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<P>In total 13 studies were considered, seven were excluded, and six included, examining a total of 719 women. For further details of study characteristics refer to '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two separate studies were reported in the same paper (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>). One study was a three-armed trial, breast stimulation versus oxytocin versus no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). Only one trial considered breast stimulation by breast pump (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>). In all studies gentle breast and nipple stimulation was performed by the women, who were all instructed to stimulate only one breast at a time.</P>
<P>Five included studies compared breast stimulation to placebo/no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>).<BR/>

<LI>In two trials stimulation was performed for one hour per day for three days. Both trials were set in a Nigerian hospital including only women at term; neither specified whether they were high or low risk. One included only primiparous women (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>), the other only multiparous women (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>In the three other studies breast stimulation was performed for three hours per day. One of these studies set in an Indian hospital was of high-risk primiparous women at term who were instructed to perform stimulation for one hour, three times per day, alternating breasts every 10 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). One Singapore study included only low-risk, primiparous women. After an initial session of stimulation at the hospital they were instructed to perform breast stimulation for three hours per day, over two or three sessions at home (<LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>). One American study also instructed women to perform breast stimulation at home, only low-risk women were included (parity was not stated), stimulation was for one hour three times per day, alternating breasts every 15 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>).</LI>

<P>
<BR/>Two included studies compared breast stimulation to oxytocin alone (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>).<BR/>

<LI>One of these studies described above was of high-risk primiparous women at term who were instructed to perform stimulation for one hour, three times per day, alternating breasts every 10 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>One American study compared oxytocin with breast stimulation by breast pump (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>). Any woman admitted to the labour suite for induction was eligible to participate, no other eligibility criteria were stated. Stimulation was by breast pump set at 'normal' (250 mm Hg of negative pressure). The nurse attending the woman alternated the pump every 15 minutes, until uterine contractions were greater or equal to 200 Montevideo units. Contractions were maintained at three minute intervals either by reducing the negative pressure or switching the pump off.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Two studies of breast stimulation versus no intervention were excluded because they were cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986b</LINK>). One trial of breast stimulation versus no intervention was excluded, as it randomised the control group a second time (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984b</LINK>). Three trials were excluded because they did not report any of the prespecified outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Lieto-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lieto 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kadar-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kadar 1990</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Four studies used random-number tables (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>). One study randomised by case record number (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>). The method of randomisation was not stated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was unclear in five of the studies, and due to randomisation by case record number was inadequate in one (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Double blinding was not feasible in the included studies. In three studies the outcome assessor was blinded to intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>). It was not stated if the analyst was blinded in any of the trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Missing data</HEADING>
<P>One trial was stopped after four perinatal deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). It was a three-armed trial with 20 women randomised to each arm (breast stimulation versus oxytocin versus no intervention). Three deaths occurred in the breast stimulation arm and one in the oxytocin arm. The study was stopped with only 17 women having entered the breast stimulation arm. No outcome data were presented for the three missing women, all women remained in the groups to which they were randomised and the analysis was conducted on an available case basis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prespecified outcomes</HEADING>
<P>When trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention were analysed there was little difference in caesarean section rates (9% versus 10%, relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 2.12). Only one trial (n = 200) reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>). There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation in any of the five studies. There was no discernible difference in the number of women who had an unfavourable/unchanged cervix after 12 to 24 hours (0% versus 5%, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.97). Only one of the five trials (n = 37) reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). There were three perinatal deaths all of which were in the breast stimulation arm of one trial (1.8% versus 0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 147.76) (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). This outcome was reported in three trials (n = 337) (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>). There was a small statistically non-significant reduction in the rates of meconium staining (25.6% versus 30%, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28). Two trials (n = 237) reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1984a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a reduction in the rate of postpartum haemorrhage when breast stimulation was compared with no treatment (0.7% versus 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.87). This outcome was reported in two trials (n = 300) conducted by the same trialists (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-prespecified outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was a reduction in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours in women who had used breast stimulation when compared with no treatment (62.7% versus 93.6%, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.74). Four trials (n = 437) reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adewole-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Adewole 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1986a</LINK>). This reduction remained significant when primiparous women and multiparous women were analysed separately, but did not remain significant in the one study that reported on this outcome in women with an unfavourable cervix. However, the relative risk estimates between the subgroups remained very similar (between 0.64 and 0.74). It is possible, therefore, that the non-significant result is due to the smaller sample size available in subgroup analyses rather than the intervention's effect being really different between the groups.</P>

<P>When trials comparing breast stimulation with oxytocin were analysed there was a difference in caesarean section rates. This was not statistically significant, however, due to the small sample sizes (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18). Only one trial (n = 62) reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Chayen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chayen 1986</LINK>). There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation in either of the two trials. The difference in the number of women who had an unfavourable/unchanged cervix after 12 to 24 hours was not statistically significant (0% versus 20%, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.25). This outcome was reported by only one trial (n = 37) (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>). There were a total of four perinatal deaths in one trial (n = 37), three were in the breast stimulation arm and one in the oxytocin arm (17.6% versus 5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 30.88) (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>None of the included studies reported on vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, however there was a significant reduction in women not in labour after 72 hours in the breast stimulation group compared with the no intervention group. There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation in any of the groups and a significant reduction in postpartum haemorrhage (breast stimulation compared with no intervention). Differences in caesarean section rates between breast stimulation and no intervention or oxytocin alone remained statistically non-significant across comparisons. In comparison to no intervention or to oxytocin, no women in a breast stimulation arm had an unfavourable/unchanged cervix after 24 hours, though this finding did not reach significance. None of the trials reported upon women's satisfaction with treatment received.</P>
<P>Whilst breast stimulation would seem to work in that there was a significant reduction in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours and postpartum haemorrhage, this has to be considered against a background of increased perinatal mortality. All four instances of perinatal mortality were in the (<LINK REF="STD-Damania-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Damania 1992</LINK>) trial which was the only included trial specifically conducted on a high-risk population. Of the deaths that occurred three were in the breast stimulation group and one in the oxytocin group. Of 57 women included in the trial, the indications for induction of labour were: post-term pregnancy (n = 25); hypertension in pregnancy (n = 22); and intrauterine growth retardation (n = 10). The authors reported that a postmortem on one of the babies revealed no anomalies, no information was presented on the other three babies who died. The results of this study should be viewed with caution as it is the only included trial which did not clearly report method of randomisation, and there were three losses to follow up, which were not analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The study was stopped due to perinatal deaths after only 17 of 20 women who had been randomised to the breast stimulation arm had entered the trial.</P>
<P>There are valid reasons not to use breast stimulation in a high-risk population until safety issues have been evaluated further. However, this form of care is likely to be beneficial in a low-risk population. The 84% reduction in postpartum haemorrhage, seen in the breast stimulation arms of two trials including 300 women, may be of particular interest to women and their healthcare providers in developing countries. Approximately 600,000 annual maternal deaths occur globally, the overwhelming majority in developing countries. It has been estimated that the single most common cause is severe bleeding, generally occurring postpartum and accounting for approximately 25% of maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). This promising finding warrants further research.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Breast stimulation appears beneficial in terms of a reduction in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and a reduction in postpartum haemorrhage. Until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be considered for use in a high-risk population. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials on breast stimulation versus placebo/no intervention or other interventions for inducing labour should be undertaken to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Future trials should seek data on postpartum haemorrhage rates, the number of women not in labour at 72 hours and maternal satisfaction with the intervention.</P>
