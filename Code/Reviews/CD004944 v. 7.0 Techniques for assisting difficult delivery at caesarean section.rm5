<P>Caesarean section involves making an incision in the woman's abdomen and then cutting through the wall of the uterus. The baby is then born through these incisions. Numerous different ways have been suggested to facilitate the birth of the baby at difficult caesarean section and reduce the risk of injury to the baby, such as fractures and nerve damage. Some situations increase the likelihood of injury to mother and baby, especially if the woman has been in labour a long time or the baby's head is deep in the mother's pelvis.</P>
<P>This review includes a total of seven studies, involving 582 women and examines which techniques are safest for mother and baby. The risk of bias in trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing the methods of randomisation.</P>
<P>At an emergency caesarean after a long labour, there is evidence from the developing world that delivery of the buttocks or feet of the baby first (reverse breech extraction) is safer than delivery of the head by pushing from the vagina back into the uterus. In four trials involving 357 women, delivery of the buttocks or feet first was associated with fewer adverse outcomes for the mother, including less bleeding, infection and a shorter operation duration. There was no significant difference in trauma to the baby but admission to special care or neonatal intensive care was decreased with delivery of the buttocks or feet first than when the head was pushed up from the vagina.</P>
<P>At a planned, non-labouring caesarean section there is limited evidence to support techniques (forceps or vacuum extractor on the baby's head) other than the use of the surgeon's hands to deliver the head of the baby through the uterine incision. Two trials involving 128 women compared forceps/vacuum with manual delivery without any significance difference in outcomes.</P>
<P>There is also insufficient evidence to support the use of medication to relax the uterus (tocolysis) at the time of a caesarean to assist with safe delivery of the baby, with only one trial involving 97 women addressing this question.</P>

<P>Caesarean section involves making an incision in the woman's abdomen and cutting through the uterine muscle. The baby is then delivered through that incision. Difficult caesarean birth may result in injury for the infant or complications for the mother. Methods to assist with delivery include vacuum or forceps extraction or manual delivery utilising fundal pressure. Medication that relaxes the uterus (tocolytic medication) may facilitate the birth of the baby at caesarean section. Delivery of the impacted head after prolonged obstructed labour can be associated with significant maternal and neonatal complication; to facilitate delivery of the head the surgeon may utilise either reverse breech extraction or head pushing.</P>

<P>Seven randomised controlled trials, involving 582 women undergoing caesarean section were included in this review. The risk of bias of included trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing allocation or randomisation.</P>
<P>Three comparisons were included.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Tocolysis versus no tocolysis</B>
</P>
<P>A single randomised trial involving 97 women was identified and included in the review. Birth trauma was not reported. There were no cases of any maternal side-effect reported in either the nitroglycerin or the placebo group. No other maternal and infant health outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Reverse breech extraction versus head push for the deeply impacted head at full dilation at caesarean section </B>
</P>
<P>Four randomised trials involving 357 women were identified and included in the review. The primary outcome of birth trauma was reported by three trials and there was no difference between reverse breech extraction and head push for this rare outcome (three studies, 239 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 5.73). Secondary outcomes including endometritis rate (three studies, 285 women, average RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.05, Tau I² = 0.22, I² = 56%), extension of uterine incision (four studies, 357 women, average RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.40), mean blood loss (three studies, 298 women, mean difference (MD) -294.92, 95% CI -493.25 to -96.59; I² = 98%) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)/special care nursery (SCN) admission (two studies, 226 babies, average RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.22, Tau I² = 0.27, I² = 74%) were decreased with reverse breech extraction. No differences were observed between groups for many of the other secondary outcomes reported (blood loss &gt; 500 mL; blood transfusion; wound infection; mean hospital stay; average Apgar score).</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity between the trials for the outcomes mean blood loss, operative time and mean hospital stay, making comparison difficult. However the operation duration was significantly shorter for reverse breech extraction, which may correspond with ease of delivery and therefore, the amount of tissue trauma and therefore, significantly less blood loss. Given the heterogeneity, we cannot define the amount of difference in blood loss, operative time or hospital stay however.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Instrument (vacuum or forceps) versus manual extraction at elective caesarean section </B>
</P>
<P>Two randomised trials involving 128 women were identified and included in the review. Only one trial reported maternal and infant health outcomes as prespecified in this review. This trial reported birth trauma as an outcome but there were no instances of birth trauma in either comparison group. There were no differences found in mean fall in haemoglobin (Hb) between groups (one study, 44 women, MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.59), or in uterine incision extension (one study, 44 women, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.73).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-03 06:15:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently insufficient information available from randomised trials to support or refute the routine or selective use of tocolytic agents or instrument to facilitate infant birth at the time of difficult caesarean section. There is limited evidence that reverse breech extraction may improve maternal and fetal outcomes, though there was no difference in primary outcome of infant birth trauma. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to answer these questions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:34:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:34:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Caesarean section involves making an incision in the woman's abdomen and cutting through the uterine muscle. The baby is then delivered through that incision. There are many situations where caesarean section is indicated, and the clinical circumstances can cause potential difficulty when delivering the baby.</P>
<P>In most situations, the baby can be delivered without trauma through the uterine incision. In other circumstances, particularly after a woman been in labour for a long period of time, delivery may be more difficult, complicated by swelling of both maternal and fetal tissue, and the position of the fetal head deep within the maternal pelvis. In this situation, the baby may be difficult to deliver through the incision, with an increased risk of trauma for both the woman and her baby.</P>
<P>In some situations, the fetal head may not be well engaged within the maternal pelvis, and delivery of the baby through the uterine incision may be difficult and require manipulation of the baby.</P>
<P>Difficult caesarean birth may result in injury for the infant (such as fractures, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord injury and subdural haematoma), resulting from direct trauma to the baby, or secondary to a delay in the timing of birth with subsequent reduction in oxygen delivery. The most common form of injury to the baby at the time of caesarean section is laceration to the skin. This is reported to occur in between 0.74% to 3.12% of all caesarean births (<LINK REF="REF-Dessole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dessole 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>). Difficult caesarean birth may also cause trauma to the mother, with injury to the broad ligament, cervix, vagina or disruption of the major uterine blood vessels or the urinary tract. The degree of damage and the amount of blood loss can impact on the duration of inpatient stay and maternal recovery.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:34:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Different techniques have been described to facilitate the delivery of the fetal head at the time of caesarean section at term (37 to 41 weeks of pregnancy). The technique depends on the location of the fetal head. At an elective caesarean, the head is often 'free floating' and methods to facilitate delivery include manual delivery utilising fundal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Costa 2006</LINK>), vacuum extraction (<LINK REF="REF-Solomens-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomens 1962</LINK>), and forceps (<LINK REF="REF-Acosta_x002d_Sison-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta-Sison 1938</LINK>). Fundal pressure involves the assistant placing one or two hands on the uterine fundus and exerting downwards force while the obstetrician directs the head towards the uterine incision (<LINK REF="REF-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Costa 2006</LINK>). Vacuum extraction was first described using a metal cup (<LINK REF="REF-Solomens-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomens 1962</LINK>) and then with a soft cup (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pelosi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelosi 1984</LINK>) applied directly to the fetal head through the uterine incision.</P>
<P>In contrast to the 'floating head' often found at elective caesarean procedures, at an emergency caesarean, the fetal head may be deeply impacted in the maternal pelvis, especially when the labour progress has been slow. Disengaging the impacted fetal head may result in extension of the uterine incision into the broad ligament, cervix or vagina, with possible damage to uterine blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Costa 2006</LINK>). Extraction and delivery of the fetal head in this situation can be achieved utilising either an abdominovaginal approach with head pushing from the vagina (<LINK REF="REF-Landesman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landesman 1984</LINK>) or reverse breech extraction, where the baby is delivered by grasping the feet or buttocks and delivering them through the incision, with the head delivered last (<LINK REF="REF-Fong-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1997</LINK>). Other techniques described include use of a disimpaction system (<LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2009</LINK>) or Patwardhan technique, where the infants shoulders are delivered, then the trunk, breech, limbs then finally the head (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-Saha-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar Saha 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mukhopadhyay-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mukhopadhyay 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>If the fetus cannot be delivered through a standard transverse incision through the lower segment, the uterine incision may need to be extended, utilising either a J shape or inverted T shape incision that commonly involves the upper segment or main part of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Costa 2006</LINK>). Such an incision is associated with more complications for the woman, especially during a subsequent pregnancy and delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Landon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The breech presentation may also pose difficulties for delivery of the baby at caesarean section in both the emergency and elective settings. Techniques utilised for delivery of a breech presentation at caesarean section include grasping a foot or both feet to facilitate delivery of the buttocks (<LINK REF="REF-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Costa 2006</LINK>). The shoulders and head can then be delivered utilising the same manoeuvres employed for vaginal breech birth, including the Lovsett and Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvres, or forceps can be applied to the aftercoming head.</P>
<P>During difficult delivery of the baby at the time of caesarean section, the uterus may contract and contribute to mechanical impediments with the delivery. A number of medications have been used in order to relax the uterus (tocolysis) and facilitate the birth of the infant. Tocolytic agents act through a variety of mechanisms to relax the uterus and prevent uterine contractions and have been used mainly in treating preterm labour and include betamimetics (such as salbutamol or terbutaline) (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>); calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine) (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014a</LINK>); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin) (<LINK REF="REF-Reinebrant-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinebrant 2015</LINK>); magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2014</LINK>); nitric oxide donors (<LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2014</LINK>); and oxytocin receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014b</LINK>). These drugs have side-effects for the woman and, as they are able to cross the placenta, may affect the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>). Side-effects for the woman include tachycardia (increased heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), nausea and vomiting, hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), and pulmonary oedema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>While uterine relaxation at caesarean section may be a beneficial effect as it relaxes the uterus to facilitate birth of the infant, it can be followed by uterine atony (where the uterus does not contract after birth) causing subsequent postpartum haemorrhage.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review compares three interventions for delivery of the fetus at caesarean section. Firstly, the use of tocolysis (routine or selective) with no use of tocolysis or placebo at the time of caesarean birth, secondly, the use of either forceps, vacuum or manual delivery with fundal pressure at the time of elective caesarean birth and finally, the use of head pushing versus reverse breech extraction for the deeply impacted fetal head at the time of emergency caesarean section.</P>
<P>These interventions may expedite the delivery of the fetus and may reduce the risk of birth trauma. Any benefit of increased ease of infant birth and reduction in birth trauma has to be balanced against the potential complications for the woman, including postpartum haemorrhage and damage to the urinary tract.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for infant and childhood, and short-term and long-term maternal morbidity, for women undergoing caesarean birth are all important to consider and potentially impacted by such interventions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:34:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Rates of caesarean section are increasing, and techniques used at this common operation should be supported by evidence to ensure rare complications, including birth trauma, are decreased.</P>
<P>Caesarean section at full dilatation with obstructed labour can be difficult, with potential complications for mother and baby. Evidence is needed to guide clinicians as to which technique, reverse breech extraction or head push best facilitates delivery with the least complications for mother and baby.</P>
<P>There are risks associated with the use of medication to relax the uterus, including excessive bleeding and possible interference with the blood the baby receives from the placenta at birth. There is currently limited evidence available to help with informed decisions around the use of these drugs at difficult caesareans. Until there is evidence that these drugs do more good than harm, they should not be used.</P>

<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this review. In future updates, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:39:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Tocolysis versus no tocolysis</HEADING>
<P>Tocolytic agents have been used extensively to induce uterine relaxation, and have been used anecdotally at the time of caesarean section, where difficulties with birth of the infant are anticipated or encountered. While uterine relaxation at caesarean section may be a beneficial effect as it relaxes the uterus to facilitate birth of the infant, it can also be followed by uterine atony (where the uterus does not contract after birth) causing subsequent postpartum haemorrhage. Any benefit to facilitate infant birth and reduction in birth trauma has to be balanced against the potential complications for the woman, including postpartum haemorrhage secondary to uterine atony.</P>
<P>There is currently insufficient information from randomised controlled trials assessing the role of tocolytic agents in facilitating infant birth at caesarean section and reducing the risk of infant birth trauma. The occurrence of maternal side-effects and risk of postpartum blood loss was similarly not reported in the single trial identified and included in the review.</P>
<P>Further information is required to address the role of tocolysis to facilitate infant birth at caesarean section adequately, with attention particularly to adequate reporting of maternal and infant health outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reverse breech versus head push for obstructed labour</HEADING>
<P>Four studies investigated caesarean section for obstructed labour, comparing reverse breech extraction with vaginal push. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bastani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bastani 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fasubaa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fasubaa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veisi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Veisi 2012</LINK>) addressed our primary outcome of infant birth trauma, and found no difference between the techniques.  However other outcome assessments reported by both authors were sufficiently homogeneous to allow analysis, they demonstrated that reverse breech extraction may be superior for mother and baby. For the mother, the risk of endometritis and uterine incision extension was significantly decreased with reverse breech extraction. For baby, likelihood of admission to special care nursery (SCN) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was significantly less with reverse breech extraction. Neither study addressed Apgar score less than four at five minutes. <LINK REF="STD-Fasubaa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fasubaa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bastani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bastani 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Veisi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Veisi 2012</LINK> did report average Apgar at five minutes, there was no difference between the comparison groups. There was no difference in early neonatal death rate or stillbirth rate.</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity between the trials for the outcomes mean blood loss, operative time and mean hospital stay, making comparison difficult. However the operation duration was significantly shorter for reverse breech extraction, which may correspond with ease of delivery and therefore the amount of tissue trauma and therefore significantly less blood loss. Given the heterogeneity we cannot define the amount of difference in blood loss, operative time or hospital stay however. The reason for the extreme heterogeneity is not apparent from the text in the published studies. Possible reasons for difference in operative time may be related to different surgical technique, difference in duration of stay may be due to different hospital policies or financial restriction on length of stay, rather than medical need.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fasubaa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fasubaa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frass-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Frass 2011</LINK>) were conducted in low-income settings (Yemen and Nigeria, respectively), and both authors commented that obstructed labour is still common in their country. Two studies were undertaken in Iran (<LINK REF="STD-Bastani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bastani 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veisi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Veisi 2012</LINK>), both having less study participant than the former two trials. These results therefore may not be applicable to obstetric units in middle-income or high-income settings. Further research is required to confirm these results in low-income settings, potentially including patients where a vaginal instrumental delivery was unsuccessfully attempted prior to caesarean section.</P>
<P>Novel methods for fetal disimpaction are reported in the literature (<LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Seal 2013</LINK>); these may be associated with less maternal and infant trauma than either vaginal push or reverse breech extraction. If data are published these may be included in the next review update.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Elective use of instrument versus fundal pressure at elective caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>Two studies addressed the use of an instrument (either vacuum or forceps) at elective caesarean section, though only one author (<LINK REF="STD-Bofill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bofill 2000</LINK>) conducted their study to investigate the safety and ease of delivery with an instrument compared with fundal pressure. <LINK REF="STD-Owens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 2003</LINK> instead investigated the amount of transplacental microtransfusion from mother to infant with fundal pressure compared with an instrument, and thus did not address the prespecified outcomes of this review. There was no difference in birth trauma in the one study that addressed this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bofill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bofill 2000</LINK>); there was no difference in infant outcomes where described, and no difference in blood loss, uterine incision extension or other maternal outcomes.</P>
<P>Further research is required to clarify the safety of using an instrument (either forceps or vacuum) instead of fundal pressure at elective caesarean section. Given the relatively low rate of birth trauma and other adverse outcomes at elective caesarean section, a large number of patients would need to be recruited to adequately power such a study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:42:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review aimed to address three clinical situations at 'difficult' caesarean section: 1) use of tocolysis compared with placebo, 2) reverse breech compared with head push from below for the deeply impacted fetal head, and 3) use of an instrument compared with manual delivery at elective caesarean section.</P>
<OL>
<LI>One trial addressing the use of tocolysis at caesarean section was included for review, unfortunately infant outcomes were not addressed in the study. There was no significant difference in maternal side-effects between the tocolysis and placebo group, and other maternal outcomes were not reported, therefore limiting analysis.</LI>
<LI>At caesarean section for obstructed labour with a deeply impacted fetal head, reverse breech extraction appears to be significantly safer for mother and baby than head push from below. Maternal outcomes demonstrating significant improvement in the reverse breech extraction group include less endometritis, decreased blood loss and decreased rates of wound extension. For babies, there was no significant difference in rates of the primary outcome, birth trauma, but neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and SCN admissions were decreased with reverse breech extraction. These results suggest that reverse breech extraction may be better for both mother and baby than head push from below.</LI>
<LI>Use of an instrument (either forceps or vacuum) at elective caesarean section compared with manual delivery did not significantly alter maternal or infant outcomes, however there was only trial suitable for inclusion that addressed these outcomes.</LI>
</OL>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:43:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Evidence for all three interventions is limited, mostly due to the small numbers of participants in the included trials. In particular, tocolysis and instrument for elective caesarean each had only one trial with data describing relevant outcomes, therefore most of the results were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The four trials addressing delivery of the deeply impacted fetal head in the context of obstructed labour were based in Nigeria, Iran and Yemen, therefore due to differences in practice and populations, generalisability may be limited.</P>

<P>The risk of bias in trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing allocation or randomisation. Blinding of assessors was frequently not adequately described.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:43:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Tocolysis - there is currently insufficient information available from randomised trials to support or refute the routine or selective use of tocolytic agents to facilitate infant birth at the time of caesarean section. There is limited information available relating to the occurrence of maternal side-effects from therapy, including morbidity related to postpartum blood loss.</P>
<P>Obstructed labour - there is limited evidence from low-income settings that reverse breech extraction instead of head push has benefits for mother and baby, including decreased operation duration, blood loss, decreased endometritis and decreased admission to special care nursery (SCN) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There was no difference in Apgar score or birth trauma. Studies included were conducted in the low-income settings and therefore these results may not be applicable to Western practice, however when a deeply impacted head is encountered at caesarean section, reverse breech extraction is a suitable technique to employ by those trained to do so.</P>
<P>Instrument at elective caesarean section - there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the routine or selective use of an instrument to deliver the fetal head at caesarean section.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-10 16:43:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials that are adequately powered to assess maternal and infant health outcomes are required to answer the question of whether use (selective or routine) of tocolytic agents or elective use of an instrument to facilitate infant birth at the time of caesarean section is of greater benefit than harm for both the woman and her infant. As the outcome of fetal injury is rare, the sample size would need to be large to be able to reliably detect differences related to their use.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are also required to assess whether the conclusions drawn above regarding reverse breech extraction are applicable in middle-income and high-income settings.</P>

<P>As part of the latest update and change in focus of this review, the outcomes and comparisons have been significantly altered from the previously published version.</P>
<P>Previously the only comparison in the review was tocolysis at caesarean section, the scope of the review has expanded to include other techniques for difficult caesarean sections. Two additional comparisons have been included; comparing reverse breech extraction with head push for fully dilated caesarean sections, and the use of an instrument compared with manual delivery at elective caesarean section.</P>
<P>The selection criteria for studies has been expanded to include studies that address the above comparisons.</P>
<P>The prespecifed outcomes have been altered to include an additional assessment of blood loss - mean fall in haemoglobin (Hb), and also assessment of average Apgar score, maternal side-effects. Length of hospital stay changed to mean hospital stay and stillbirth rate removed.</P>
<P>As a consequence of the change in scope, the title has changed from, 'Tocolysis for assisting delivery at caesarean section' to 'Techniques for assisting difficult delivery at caesarean section'.</P>
