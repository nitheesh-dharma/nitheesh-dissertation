<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-04 11:25:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is it more effective to repair or replace faulty fillings that have been constructed from amalgam (a mixture of various metals and mercury) in molar teeth towards the back of the mouth in adults?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Fillings are used as part of general dental treatment to rebuild teeth after a patient develops tooth decay or damages the surface of their tooth in some way. </P>
<P>Fillings also help to prevent further damage occurring (this can be through further tooth decay under the filling or from impact), but they must be maintained to ensure that the fillings continue to protect what is left of the original tooth. As with any filling material these fillings have a limited life-span.</P>
<P>Traditionally faulty fillings have been replaced, however this approach may involve the loss of further bits of tooth as the cavity is emptied and re-filled.</P>
<P>An alternative approach is to repair the faulty filling. Repairing fillings may take less time, and as some repairs can be performed without the need to numb the area (local anaesthesia), a repair may be less distressing for the patient when compared with the option of replacing the filling. Issues such as pain, anxiety, distress, time and cost are important considerations for dentists as well as patients.</P>
<P>This review aims to compare whether it is better to replace or repair amalgam fillings. The evidence for repair or replacement of resin composite fillings is contained in a separate review.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 5 August 2013.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Currently there is no evidence to support repairing or replacing amalgam fillings for adults.</P>
<P>Further well-conducted research is required before an evidence-based recommendation can be supported.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-14 10:58:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amalgam is a common filling material for posterior teeth, as with any restoration amalgams have a finite life-span. Traditionally replacement was the ideal approach to treat defective amalgam restorations, however, repair offers an alternative more conservative approach where restorations are only partially defective. Repairing a restoration has the potential of taking less time and may sometimes be performed without the use of local anaesthesia hence it may be less distressing for a patient when compared with replacement. Repair of amalgam restorations is often more conservative of the tooth structure than replacement.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-01-30 11:54:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the identification of studies relevant to this review we searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 5 August 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 7); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 5 August 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 5 August 2013); BIOSIS via Web of Knowledge (1969 to 5 August 2013); Web of Science (1945 to 5 August 2013) and OpenGrey (to 5 August 2013). Researchers, experts and organisations known to be involved in this field were contacted in order to trace unpublished or ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-01-30 11:54:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trial (including split-mouth studies), involving replacement and repair of amalgam restorations in adults with a defective restoration in a molar or premolar tooth/teeth.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-11 15:55:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts for each article identified by the searches in order to decide whether the article was likely to be relevant. Full papers were obtained for relevant articles and both review authors studied these. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-30 11:55:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy retrieved 201 potentially eligible studies after de-duplication. After examination of the titles and abstracts, full texts of the relevant studies were retrieved but none of these met the inclusion criteria of the review.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-30 11:56:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no published randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question. There is therefore a need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>). Further research also needs to explore qualitatively the views of patients on repairing versus replacement and investigate themes around pain, distress and anxiety, time and costs.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-30 12:01:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>The treatment of dental caries is a major focus of clinical dentistry. Amalgam is a commonly used filling material but amalgam restorations have a finite life-span. Replacement has traditionally been seen as the ideal approach to the treatment of defective amalgam restorations and may be the only option where a defect is extensive. However, repair offers an alternative more conservative approach where a restoration is only partially defective (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>). An amalgam restoration may be considered defective as a result of secondary caries, chipping or fracture of the amalgam, chipping or fracture of the tooth or alternatively the presence of a marginal defect/s (i.e. gap/s between the restoration and the tooth surface).</P>
<P>Replacement restorations make up a major part of the dental treatment provided in Europe and the United States of America (USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DPB-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPB 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Setcos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setcos 2004</LINK>) and place a high financial burden on dental health services (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 1995</LINK>). The decisions leading to the placement, replacement or repair of restorations are central to clinical dental practice but appear to be based on local practice patterns and individual clinical experience rather than evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deligeorgi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deligeorgi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-30 16:23:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>Replacement involves the complete removal of old amalgam together with base or lining materials and carries a risk of the inadvertent removal of sound tooth tissue. Repeated replacement is therefore associated with a progressive increase in cavity size (<LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 1998</LINK>). In addition, each time dentine is cut during cavity preparation there is a risk of damage to the dental pulp and the development of clinical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>). Although the commonest reason for the replacement of a filling is the diagnosis of secondary caries (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Setcos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setcos 2004</LINK>), the definition of this is ill-defined and lesions diagnosed as secondary caries may encompass both non-carious defects and small areas of secondary caries which are amenable to repair (<LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 2002b</LINK>). The belief that microleakage of oral fluids into marginal or interfacial defects leads to secondary caries or pulpal pathology underpinned the traditional support for replacement over repair. However, although microleakage may be observed under laboratory conditions, it does not necessarily occur in the clinical situation (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the repair of a defective amalgam restoration only the defective area is removed and replaced. Repair offers a pragmatic approach and has a number of potential advantages - it is more conservative, quicker, cheaper, less traumatic to the patient and the tooth, and local anaesthesia may not be required (<LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f6_r-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjör 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-30 12:17:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>Funding systems may influence dentists' decisions about whether to replace or repair restorations (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2002</LINK>). For example, 'fee for item of service' systems may favour replacement whereas capitation-based systems are more likely to encourage repair. Dentists' decisions on whether to replace or repair may also be influenced by teaching which has traditionally advocated replacement as the treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>) and a lack of knowledge about repair techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>As part of the Minamata Convention on Mercury the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in 2013 agreed that amalgam will be phased down and the use of appropriate non-mercury based materials should be researched and encouraged (<A HREF="http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Home/tabid/3360/Default.aspx">www.mercuryconvention.org/Home/tabid/3360/Default.aspx</A>). While the British Dental Association (BDA) and FDI World Dental Federation have taken the position that the complete phasing out of amalgam is only appropriate when viable replacement restorative materials are available (<A HREF="http://www.bda.org/dentists/policy-campaigns/public-health-science/dental-amalgam.aspx">www.bda.org/dentists/policy-campaigns/public-health-science/dental-amalgam.aspx</A>), the World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated a phasing down rather than phasing out of the use of amalgam.<BR/>

<P>In the context of this systematic review, the terms 'repair' and 'replacement' are defined as follows. A repair to an amalgam restoration is defined as the removal of only the defective part of a restoration or adjacent tooth tissue or both and followed by the placement of a new 'partial' restoration. A replacement amalgam restoration is defined as the removal of an entire restoration including any bases, liners, secondary caries and tooth tissue where appropriate, followed by the placement of a new restoration.</P>
<P>This systematic review was not concerned with studies involving the refurbishment of amalgam restorations. In order to ensure that there is clarity regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria, refurbishment is defined for the purposes of this review as the reshaping, refinishing or removal of overhangs in an existing restoration which does not require the placement of additional restorative material.</P>
<P>In order to be included in this review, studies must have used clearly defined criteria for assessing whether restorations were defective. Studies were expected to use the same criteria at baseline and follow-up stages. Although criteria for standardising the diagnosis of defective restorations are not well defined or universally accepted, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria and modified Ryge criteria provide possible models for this (<LINK REF="REF-Ryge-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryge 1981</LINK>).</P>

<P>At least two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of studies resulting from the searches. Full text copies of all relevant and potentially relevant studies, those appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, were obtained. The full text papers were assessed independently by these two review authors and any disagreement on the eligibility of potentially included studies were resolved through discussion and consensus. If consensus could not be reached by the two review authors a third review author was consulted. After assessment by the review authors, studies that did not match the inclusion criteria were excluded and the reasons for their exclusion noted. If any of the studies of interest had multiple publications, these were identified and grouped under the same study.</P>
<P>No eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found in the original review (published in 2010) and in the subsequent update (in 2014). If any studies were eligible, the standard methods as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>would be undertaken for data analysis and discussion of results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-01-30 15:14:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention would have been expressed as risk ratios. Survival or time-to-event data would have been analysed as hazard ratios if data were available.</P>
<P>For any possible continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were to be used to summarise the data for each group. If different scales were used to measure the same outcome and these were considered to be similar enough for pooling, standardised mean differences would have been used to summarise the pooled data.</P>
<P>All measures of treatment effect were to be reported together with their respective confidence intervals.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-01-30 15:19:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>The units of randomisation and analysis in the included trials would ideally all have been at the level of the individual. When split-mouth studies were included and each individual trial participant had one tooth randomised to intervention and another randomised to control, analyses would have taken into account the paired nature of the data. In trials where the unit of randomisation was the tooth and the number of teeth included in the trial was not more than twice the number of participants, the data were to be treated as if the unit of randomisation was the individual. It was recognised that the resulting 95% confidence intervals produced would appear narrower (i.e. the estimate would seem to be more precise) than they should be, and would therefore have been interpreted accordingly.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-01-30 15:20:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>If studies met the inclusion criteria of the review, attempts would have been made to retrieve missing data from authors of trials. Methods for estimating missing standard deviations in section 7.7.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1302251037132586624303423218310&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>) and techniques described by Follmann (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) would also be used to estimate the standard error of the difference for split-mouth studies, where the appropriate data were not presented and could not be obtained.</P>
<P>Proportions of participants for whom outcome data were not provided would have been recorded in the summary of study characteristics table and also the risk of bias table. If missing data were significant, the risk would have been assessed by undertaking available case and intention-to-treat analyses and comparing these using sensitivity analysis.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-01-30 15:20:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>Apart from statistical heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity in terms of patient population, intervention, comparison and how outcomes were measured and reported would have been considered before any decisions to pool the data were made and in the description of results.</P>
<P>If more than one study was found and included in the meta-analysis, forest plots would have been visually inspected for the presence of heterogeneity. Formal statistical tests using Cochran's Q statistic (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with K-1 degrees of freedom, where K is the number of studies) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic would have been used. Statistical heterogeneity would have been considered as present if P value of Chi<SUP>2</SUP> was 0.1 or I<SUP>2 </SUP>value was 50% or higher (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 17:56:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lee-Yee Chong">
<P>Meta-analysis would only have been undertaken using comparable studies in which the same outcome measures were reported. Heterogeneity would have firstly been assessed by examining the types of participant, interventions and outcomes in each study. For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of an intervention would have been summarised as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Any continuous outcomes would have been recorded as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects models would have been used for all analyses involving more than three trials otherwise fixed-effect models were to be used.</P>
<P>If split-mouth studies were included, this would have been combined with data from parallel group trials using the method outlined by Elbourne (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1302251037132586624303423218310&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Elbourne-2002">Elbourne 2002</A>), using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials were found. The results of this systematic review confirm the need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>), with important consideration given to the methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of patients and outcome assessors; pre-specification of outcomes to be measured and justification of sample sizes; and management of missing data and patients lost to follow-up during the planning, conducting and reporting phase of the study.</P>
<P>The following summarises the key features of a potential randomised controlled trial.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Population:<B> </B>Adults (16 years or over) with one or more defective amalgam restoration(s) in a molar or premolar tooth/teeth treated by like-for-like replacement (i.e. replacement with amalgam) or like-for-like repair (i.e. repair with amalgam) or both. An amalgam restoration may be considered defective as a result of secondary caries, chipping or fracture of the amalgam, chipping or fracture of the tooth or alternatively the presence of a marginal defect/s (i.e. gap/s between the restoration and the tooth surface).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention: Repair of a defective amalgam restoration in a permanent molar or premolar tooth with amalgam.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Control: Replacement of a defective amalgam restoration in a permanent molar or premolar tooth with amalgam.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Outcomes:</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>Success or failure of restoration, as defined by the USPHS criteria.</LI>
<LI>Further restoration (repair, restoration, placement of crown inlay; root filling) required.</LI>
<LI>Presence of clinical symptoms (pain, swelling, diagnosis of pulpitis, abscess formation).</LI>
<LI>Extraction of tooth.</LI>
<LI>Pain or discomfort associated with the procedure (perioperative) or postoperative (within 48 hours).</LI>
<LI>Patient satisfaction, as measured by a validated patient satisfaction or aesthetic scales.</LI>
<LI>Adverse effects.</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Timing of outcome assessment:<B> </B>Medium term (up to five years) or long term (five years and above) should be obtained. Time-to-event (survival data) data should be considered for these outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition to a randomised controlled trial, further research needs to explore qualitatively the views of patients on repairing versus replacement and investigate themes around pain, distress and anxiety, time and costs which will all be relevant and perhaps support repairing as this is less distressing, can be considerably cheaper and quicker to implement.</P>
<P>With the Minamata Convention on Mercury agreeing that amalgam will be phased down and the use of appropriate non-mercury based materials should be researched and encouraged, the replacement of amalgam with alternative materials will change the rationale for this review and any possible future updates.</P>
