<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Question: </B>Are nitric oxide donors, L-arginine, or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors safe and effective drugs for use in people soon after they have suffered a stroke?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Nitric oxide is a key molecule involved in the control of blood pressure, blood flow, and brain activity, both before and during a brain attack (stroke, either due to a blockage or rupture of an artery in the brain). Drugs that produce nitric oxide or control its production may be beneficial in acute stroke. This review looked at trials that tested such drugs in people with a stroke that came on within the last few days.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>This review is up-to-date as of September 2016. We included five trials involving 4197 people; all trials assessed glyceryl trinitrate, a drug that is given as a skin patch and which releases nitric oxide. One study was international, whilst the remainder were studies performed at single centres. Not all trials contributed data to all outcomes. We used both unpublished and published information, where available. We did not find any trials assessing other nitrate drugs, L-arginine, or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>Overall, glyceryl trinitrate did not improve the rate of death or dependency compared with those who did not receive glyceryl trinitrate after acute stroke. Glyceryl trinitrate did not improve other outcomes including death and quality of life. Glyceryl trinitrate lowers blood pressure, and increases heart rate and headache in people with acute stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>The key results are based on high-quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions: </B>There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drugs affecting nitric oxide production in acute stroke. Overall, glyceryl trinitrate is inexpensive, lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and headache, but does not change clinical outcomes in people who have suffered a stroke.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:32:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Nitric oxide (NO) has multiple effects that may be beneficial in acute stroke, including lowering blood pressure, and promoting reperfusion and cytoprotection. Some forms of nitric oxide synthase inhibition (NOS-I) may also be beneficial. However, high concentrations of NO are likely to be toxic to brain tissue. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1998, and last updated in 2002.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-13 11:18:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the safety and efficacy of NO donors, L-arginine, and NOS-I in people with acute stroke.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:32:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), ISI Science Citation Indexes (1981 to June 2016), Stroke Trials Registry (searched June 2016), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) (searched June 2016), Clinical Trials registry (searched June 2016), and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched June 2016). Previously, we had contacted drug companies and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-02-06 16:02:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing nitric oxide donors, L-arginine, or NOS-I versus placebo or open control in people within one week of onset of confirmed stroke.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. The review authors cross-checked data and resolved issues through discussion. We obtained published and unpublished data, as available. Data were reported as mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included five completed trials, involving 4197 participants; all tested transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor. The assessed risk of bias was low across the included studies; one study was double-blind, one open-label and three were single-blind. All included studies had blinded outcome assessment. Overall, GTN did not improve the primary outcome of death or dependency at the end of trial (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &gt; 2, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10, 4195 participants, high-quality evidence). GTN did not improve secondary outcomes, including death (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.50) and quality of life (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.15) at the end of trial overall (high-quality evidence). Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) was lower in people treated with GTN (MD -7.2 mmHg (95% CI -8.6 to -5.9) and MD -3.3 (95% CI -4.2 to -2.5) respectively) and heart rate was higher (MD 2.0 beats per minute (95% CI 1.1 to 2.9)). Headache was more common in those randomised to GTN (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.62). We did not find any trials assessing other nitrates, L-arginine, or NOS-I.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:32:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of NO donors, L-arginine or NOS-I in acute stroke, and only one drug (GTN) has been assessed. In people with acute stroke, GTN reduces blood pressure, increases heart rate and headache, but does not alter clinical outcome (all based on high-quality evidence).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-20 10:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-04-19 15:22:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the most common cause of disability in the western world (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2004</LINK>). Blood pressure (BP) is elevated in 75%, or more, of people with acute stroke (whether due to blockage (ischaemic stroke) or rupture (intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)) of an artery), and half of those have an existing diagnosis of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 1992</LINK>). In two-thirds of people with stroke, BP spontaneously falls in the first week after stroke, whilst the remainder have high BP, which is associated with a poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2004</LINK>). Systolic BP is related to outcome in a 'U-shaped' relationship with both high and low systolic BP associated with increased death, and death or dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>). Elevated systolic BP is also associated with early stroke recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cerebral autoregulation maintains cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP: blood pressure supplying the brain). In acute stroke, autoregulation is lost so that cerebral perfusion becomes related to CPP, and therefore systemic BP (<LINK REF="REF-Tikhonoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tikhonoff 2009</LINK>). Thus, large and precipitous reductions in BP reduce CBF, leading to further cerebral infarction (brain cell death from lack of blood flow; 
<LINK REF="REF-Owens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 2011</LINK>) or perihaematomal ischaemia (reduced blood flow to brain tissue surrounding the ICH; 
<LINK REF="REF-Qureshi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qureshi 2008</LINK>). Similarly, high BP increases the risk of haematoma (bleed) growth in ICH, haemorrhagic transformation in ischaemic stroke, and cerebral oedema (brain swelling) in both stroke types (<LINK REF="REF-Fagan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-04-20 10:34:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Nitric oxide (NO) (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) is an endogenous (present within humans) inorganic soluble gas formed from the guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine and molecular oxygen by the enzyme (catalyst) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1988</LINK>). This enzyme is present within endothelial cells (endothelial NOS, eNOS, type III NOS) and some neurones (brain cells; neuronal NOS, nNOS, type I NOS) in a calcium-dependent constitutive form (<LINK REF="REF-Knowles-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowles 1989</LINK>), and in macrophages (white blood cells), astrocytes, microglia (brain cells), and vascular smooth muscle cells (inducible NOS, iNOS, type II NOS) in a calcium-independent inducible form (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cho-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho 1992</LINK>). NO is one of the most versatile molecules in animal and human biology with diverse roles in both physiology and pathophysiology: it is a vasodilator (dilates blood vessels) with anti-smooth muscle cell activity (<LINK REF="REF-Murad-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murad 1987</LINK>); protects endothelium; inhibits platelet (circulating cell fragments involved in clotting) adhesion and aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Radomski-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radomski 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radomski-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radomski 1987b</LINK>) and leucocyte (white blood cells) adhesion and chemotaxis (movement of cells to an attractant) (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 1991</LINK>), and has other anti-inflammatory properties. Further, it is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (chemical messenger) (<LINK REF="REF-Garthwaite-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garthwaite 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manzoni-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzoni 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1994</LINK>), and is involved in cerebral blood flow auto- and chemo-regulation (control of brain blood flow) (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavi 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In experimental pre-clinical studies of ischaemic stroke, significant changes relating to NO occur in a time-dependent fashion. In models of focal ischaemic stroke, there is increased NO production for up to 30 minutes following middle cerebral artery occlusion or blockage (<LINK REF="REF-Kader-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kader 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malinski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinski 1993</LINK>), likely due to increased calcium availability and nNOS activation (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1994</LINK>). eNOS and nNOS activity increases in line with NO within the first minutes following middle cerebral artery occlusion and significantly reduces thereafter (<LINK REF="REF-Kader-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kader 1993</LINK>), whilst iNOS is upregulated (increased activity) from 12 hours after the event, this lasting for up to seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Niwa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niwa 2001</LINK>). Within brain tissue, NO is undetectable for up to seven days following ictus (stroke onset) (<LINK REF="REF-Malinski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinski 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravenous (injected into a vein) L-arginine given after middle cerebral artery occlusion improved cerebral blood flow within the ischaemic penumbra (area of brain tissue surrounding the infarct that is at risk of infarction) and reduced infarct size and volume (<LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 1994</LINK>). However, this observation was not seen in eNOS-deficient mice, who also have lower post-ischaemic cerebral blood flow, larger infarcts, smaller penumbral areas (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1996</LINK>), and absent angiogenesis (development of new blood vessels), potentially leading to increased post-ischaemic damage (<LINK REF="REF-Cui-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cui 2009</LINK>). The advantageous effects of eNOS activity are supported by evidence that eNOS phosphorylation-deficient mice (mice with inactive eNOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Atochin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atochin 2007</LINK>) and mice deficient in the alpha-1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase have increased infarct size (<LINK REF="REF-Atochin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atochin 2010</LINK>). Whilst eNOS and eNOS-derived NO are neuroprotective (protecting brain cells against further damage) following cerebral infarction, nNOS-derived NO (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hara 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaharchuk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaharchuk 1997</LINK>) and iNOS-derived NO (<LINK REF="REF-Iadecola-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iadecola 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iadecola-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iadecola 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2003</LINK>) are detrimental to tissue survival resulting in poorer neurological outcome. Despite being neurotoxic in the acute phase following stroke, iNOS and nNOS seem to be important in neurogenesis (formation of new brain cells) post-stroke, with iNOS promoting (<LINK REF="REF-Sehara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehara 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corsani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corsani 2008</LINK>) and nNOS attenuating this process (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the weight of evidence for NO-mediated neuroprotection post-stroke, several therapeutic strategies have been proposed: replacement or supplementation of NO deficiency through administration of NO, NO donors or precursors; enhancement of eNOS activity to modulate or increase endogenous NO production (<LINK REF="REF-Endres-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 2004</LINK>); and direct or indirect inhibition of NOS.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-19 15:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Vascular NO levels are low in acute stroke and so replacement might be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rashid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rashid 2003</LINK>). NO, however delivered, may have multiple effects that could improve outcome after stroke.</P>
<UL>
<LI>BP lowering: NO donors (intravenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)) lower BP, pulse pressure, and peak systolic BP; improve arterial compliance; and maintain CBF in acute stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Butterworth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butterworth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bath-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bath 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rashid-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willmot-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willmot 2006</LINK>). Whilst SNP inhibits platelet function, thereby negating its use in ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Butterworth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butterworth 1998</LINK>), GTN has no effect on platelets and can therefore be used in people with stroke, regardless of stroke type (<LINK REF="STD-Bath-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bath 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Reperfusion (improving blood supply): NO dilates cerebral arteries and could then increase perilesional perfusion (blood flow around the stroke lesion via the 'front door') without inducing cerebral steal (<LINK REF="STD-Willmot-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willmot 2006</LINK>). Pial artery (brain surface artery) blood flow and, therefore, collateral flow may provide 'back-door' reperfusion to the ischaemic penumbra in ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 1992b</LINK>) and the perihaematomal region in ICH.</LI>
<LI>Cytoprotection (cell protection): NO exhibits neuroprotective effects, as found in experimental studies (see above). Whether these effects involve cellular protection per se or just reflect reperfusion remains unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>NO donors could also have adjunctive effects, enhancing the effects of existing reperfusion therapies by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lowering BP: NO donors may prepare people with hyper-acute (within a few hours) ischaemic stroke for thrombolysis (clot-dissolving therapy; non-significant tendencies to more and earlier intravenous thrombolysis were seen in the pilot RIGHT trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ankolekar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ankolekar 2013</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Dilating cerebral arteries around occluding clot, NO donors may enhance access to the clot by both endogenous and exogenous fibrinolysis (clot-dissolving compounds found within the body and administered as treatment).</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-20 10:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Evidence-based treatments for acute stroke are limited. In hyper-acute ischaemic stroke, there are interventions with high efficacy but limited utility (intravenous thrombolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Emberson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emberson 2014</LINK>); thrombectomy (removal of clot causing large vessel occlusion) (<LINK REF="REF-Goyal-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goyal 2016</LINK>); and decompressive hemicraniectomy (surgery to remove one side of the skull to relieve intracranial pressure) (<LINK REF="REF-Vahedi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vahedi 2007</LINK>)), and those with low efficacy but high utility (aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2014</LINK>)). In comparison, there are no definitive treatments for ICH other than early BP lowering (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>). All patients with stroke should have access to stroke unit care (<LINK REF="REF-Stroke-Unit-Trialists_x0027_-Collaboration-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroke Unit Trialists' Collaboration 2013</LINK>).</P>

Individual patient data were available for all included trials and this allowed subgroup analyses and calculation of means and standard deviations to facilitate parametric analyses of ordinal outcomes such as mRS.

<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data.</LI>

<P>Each domain includes one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool describes what was reported to have happened in the study in sufficient detail to support a judgement on the risk of bias. The second part assigns a judgement relating to the risk of bias: 'Low risk' of bias, 'High risk' of bias, or 'Unclear risk' of bias, according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-19 15:32:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Five trials involving 4197 participants assessed transdermal GTN in acute stroke. Overall, GTN did not significantly influence clinical outcomes including death or disability, death, neurological deterioration, severity, mood, quality of life, cognition, length of hospital stay, therapy requirements, or feeding route.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses showed that participants randomised to GTN with baseline systolic BP &lt;160 or 180 to 200 mmHg had increased rates of neurological deterioration compared with controls. Conversely, receiving GTN with a baseline systolic BP 180 to 200 mmHg was associated with lower rates of occupational therapy but higher rates were seen with a baseline systolic BP &gt; 200 mmHg. There were no consistent effects across outcomes regarding baseline systolic BP. Participants randomised to GTN within six hours of symptom onset had nonsignificant reductions in the rates of death or dependency (mRS &gt; 2) and non-oral feeding, and significant improvements in NIHSS at end of treatment, and death or dependency (mean mRS), death, disability, mood, quality of life, and cognition at end of trial. Although participants randomised to GTN between 24 and 36 hours after stroke onset had an increased chance of neurological deterioration, no significant findings were noted in any other clinical outcomes for this time period. Some of the heterogeneity seen between the trials for several outcomes may relate to the differing times from stroke onset to randomisation, which ranged from within four hours of onset up to 168 hours from onset.</P>
<P>In respect of haemodynamics, BP was significantly lowered by GTN as compared with control regardless of stroke type and time to randomisation, whilst heart rate was significantly increased overall, regardless of stroke type, and in those randomised between 24 and 36 hours after stroke onset. Headache, a recognised side effect of GTN, was more commonly seen in those randomised to GTN overall, in both stroke types, at all times of randomisation and in all but those with baseline systolic BP &gt; 200 mmHg.</P>
<P>Of note, there was no significant difference in the rate of treatment being stopped early between GTN and control but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. Those who received GTN between six and 36 hours of stroke onset were more likely to stop treatment early; a finding driven by ENOS (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:35:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review includes all identified trials of NO donors in people with recent stroke. All five trials studied transdermal GTN and no RCTs assessing other NO donors, L-arginine or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors have been completed. The results from trials assessing GTN should not be extrapolated to other NO donors, L-arginine or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. With 4197 participants across five trials, this review has substantial external validity and is able to comment on the safety and efficacy of GTN in acute stroke. Overall, GTN was safe, lowered BP and increased heart rate, but had no beneficial effect on primary and secondary clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>The potential benefit of GTN seen in participants randomised within six hours of onset may represent chance, but there are several explanations to suggest that the association could be real.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The beneficial effects seen were across multiple outcomes including death, dependency (mRS), disability (BI), mood (ZDS), NIHSS, quality of life (EQ-5D health utility status and EQ-VAS) and cognition (t-MMSE, TICS, animal naming).</LI>
<LI>The effects were seen in two separate trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ankolekar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ankolekar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The effects were seen in a population of over 300 participants. This group is equivalent in size to each of the parts of the positive NINDS trials of intravenous alteplase (<LINK REF="REF-NINDS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINDS 1995</LINK>) and recent trials of mechanical thrombectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Goyal-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goyal 2016</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The time-dependent effect of NO donors has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies in which early treatment within 60 minutes of ischaemia was associated with positive outcomes as compared with neutral outcomes in those studies assessing treatment up to 48 hours following induction of ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2005</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Hyperacute administration of NO donors, such as GTN, has several potential mechanisms of action alluded to in the background of this review.</P>
<OL>
<LI>NO levels are low in acute stroke and replacing this deficiency may be beneficial.</LI>
<LI>NO donors lower BP, pulse pressure and peak systolic BP, and improve arterial compliance. Lowering BP acutely may reduce early recurrence following ischaemic stroke, and haematoma expansion in ICH (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>NO dilates cerebral arteries thereby increasing perilesional perfusion through the 'front door' without resultant cerebral steal (<LINK REF="STD-Willmot-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willmot 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>NO is a potent vasodilator of pial arteries leading to 'back-door' collateral reperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 1992b</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>NO donors are neuroprotective when administered early after preclinical ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>NO donors might augment the effects of established interventions such as intravenous alteplase, both through preparing patients for treatment by lowering BP, and potentially by increasing access of lytics to occluding clot.</LI>

<P>This review has several strengths.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The study cohort was large, involving more than 4000 participants.</LI>
<LI>Individual patient data were used from all identified controlled trials of NO donors, facilitating subgroup analyses.</LI>
<LI>Differing participant characteristics between trials broadened external validity.</LI>
<LI>The trials examined different time-windows after stroke onset including ultra-acute/pre-hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Ankolekar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ankolekar 2013</LINK>), hyper-acute (&lt; 6 hours) (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>), acute (&lt; 48 hours) (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>), and sub-acute (&lt; 168 hours) (<LINK REF="STD-Bath-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bath 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rashid-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willmot-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willmot 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Safety and efficacy were assessed across a multitude of outcomes encompassing multiple clinical domains; similar results across outcome domains and trials suggest intra- and inter-trial consistency.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There are also several limitations of this review.</P>
<OL>
<LI>GTN was the only NO donor assessed in the included RCTs and therefore the results cannot be extrapolated to other NO donors, for which there is no RCT-based evidence.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK> accounted for 95.6% of all participants included in this review, and therefore dominated the data and subsequent analyses.</LI>
<LI>All these data were reported by the same research group and therefore the results need to be validated and extended by other research groups.</LI>
<LI>Only one of the included studies was double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Bath-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bath 2001</LINK>), with the remainder being single-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Ankolekar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ankolekar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willmot-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willmot 2006</LINK>) or open-label (<LINK REF="STD-Rashid-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 2002</LINK>). Further, headache, a common side effect of GTN, may have unblinded some participants. In addition, despite all end-of-trial outcome measures being performed by assessors blinded to treatment in the included studies, observer bias cannot be excluded.</LI>
<LI>The results relating to ultra-acute and hyper-acute treatment involved a relatively small number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ankolekar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ankolekar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>); these findings should be considered provisional and require formal testing.</LI>
<LI>This review contains analyses involving a variety of outcomes assessed in several subgroups. Such multiple testing can lead to spurious results and it is possible that some findings may simply reflect chance, e.g. increased neurological deterioration in certain BP subgroups (in the absence of a trend across BP, or a negative effect on the NIHSS), or variation in occupational therapy utilisation in BP subgroups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In summary, the overall quality of the evidence as assessed by GRADE criteria was high, due to the aforementioned strengths of the included studies.</P>

<P>This review was compiled following an extensive literature search, without language restrictions, by both the review authors and Cochrane Stroke Group. The resultant risk for publication bias is therefore low. However, all the included trials were from the same research group - of which the authors are members - which may have potentially introduced bias in the review process, e.g. in choice of outcomes and subgroups. Nevertheless, all outcomes reported in the included trials were summarised here (including mRS, BI, EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, t-MMSE, TICS-M, animal naming, ZDS, NIHSS, death), and subgroups (time, stroke type, blood pressure) were used as prespecified in the ENOS trial (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2015</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:36:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A recently published systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis assessed the same five trials of transdermal GTN under the auspices of the Blood pressure in Acute Stroke Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-BASC-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2016</LINK>). Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed including a predefined subgroup analysis by time to randomisation. In this regard, the results and conclusions of both reviews were similar showing that GTN is safe though ineffective overall, but may improve outcome in a time-dependent manner if given within six hours of stroke onset.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:36:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of NO donors, L-arginine, or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in acute stroke, with only RCT evidence available for the NO donor, GTN. In people with acute stroke, transdermal GTN reduces blood pressure, increases heart rate and headache, but does not alter outcome. When administered within six hours, GTN may improve clinical outcomes, a finding that requires confirmation in an independent trial (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-RIGHT_x002d_2-2015" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT-2 2015</LINK>)<I>.</I>

<LI>Mechanisms by which GTN might work, e.g. potentially through reducing haematoma expansion in ICH, and improving collateral supply in ischaemic stroke (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-RIGHT_x002d_2-2015" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT-2 2015</LINK>).</LI>
