<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-24 11:45:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. For a child to be diagnosed with ADHD, adults such as parents, carers, healthcare workers or teachers must have noticed higher levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity in the child before the age of seven years compared to children of similar age. The inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity must be observed in a range of situations, for a substantial period of time and cause impairment to the child&#8217;s learning or social development. Parent training programmes aim to equip parents with techniques to manage their child's 'difficult' or ADHD-related behaviour (that is their inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity).</P>
<P>We found five randomised controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. Four set out to improve children's general behaviour and one focused specifically on how parents could help their children make friends. All studies were small and their quality varied. Results from these studies were somewhat encouraging as far as parental stress and general child behaviour were concerned, but were uncertain with regard to other important outcomes including ADHD-related behaviour. No study provided data on the key outcomes of achievement in school, harmful effects or parent knowledge of ADHD. There was no evidence to say whether parent training is better delivered in groups or individually.<I> </I>
</P>
<P>The evidence we found was limited in terms of the size of the trials and in their quality, and therefore we do not think it can be used as the basis for guidelines of treatment of ADHD in clinics or schools. We believe more research is needed and that it should ensure better reporting of the study procedures and results.</P>

<P>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by high levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before the age of seven years, seen in a range of situations, inconsistent with the child's developmental level and causing social or academic impairment.

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-11-04 16:02:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether parent training interventions are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and associated problems in children aged between five and eigtheen years with a diagnosis of ADHD, compared to controls with no parent training intervention.<BR/>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-10-24 11:30:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases (for all available years until September 2010): CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to 10 September 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 36), CINAHL (1937 to 13 September 2010), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (14 September 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (14 September 2010). We contacted experts in the field to ask for details of unpublished or ongoing research.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-20 04:58:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised (including quasi-randomised) studies comparing parent training with no treatment, a waiting list or treatment as usual (adjunctive or otherwise). We included studies if ADHD was the main focus of the trial and participants were over five years old and had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder that was made by a specialist using the operationalised diagnostic criteria of the DSM-III/DSM-IV or ICD-10. We only included trials that reported at least one child outcome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-07 16:07:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four authors were involved in screening abstracts and at least 2 authors looked independently at each one. We reviewed a total of 12,691 studies and assessed five as eligible for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the five included trials. Opportunities for meta-analysis were limited and most data that we have reported are based on single studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-04 16:27:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found five studies including 284 participants that met the inclusion criteria, all of which compared parent training with de facto treatment as usual (TAU). One study included a nondirective parent support group as a second control arm.  </P>
<P>Four studies targeted children's behaviour problems and one assessed changes in parenting skills. </P>
<P>Of the four studies targeting children's behaviour, two focused on behaviour at home and two focused on behaviour at school. The two studies focusing on behaviour at home had different findings: one found no difference between parent training and treatment as usual, whilst the other reported statistically significant results for parent training versus control. The two studies of behaviour at school also had different findings: one study found no difference between groups, whilst the other reported positive results for parent training when ADHD was not comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. In this latter study, outcomes were better for girls and for children on medication.</P>
<P>We assessed the risk of bias in most of the studies as unclear at best and often as high. Information on randomisation and allocation concealment did not appear in any study report. Inevitably, blinding of participants or personnel was impossible for this intervention; likewise, blinding of outcome assessors (who were most often the parents who had delivered the intervention) was impossible.</P>
<P>We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for two outcomes: child 'externalising' behaviour (a measure of rulebreaking, oppositional behaviour or aggression) and child 'internalising' behaviour (for example, withdrawal and anxiety). Meta-analysis of three studies (n = 190) providing data on externalising behaviour produced results that fell short of statistical significance (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.18, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%). A meta-analysis of two studies (n = 142) for internalising behaviour gave significant results in the parent training groups (SMD -0.48; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.13, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 9%). Data from a third study likely to have contributed to this outcome were missing, and we have some concerns about selective outcome reporting bias.</P>
<P>Individual study results for child behaviour outcomes were mixed. Positive results on an inventory of child behaviour problems were reported for one small study (n = 24) with the caveat that results were only positive when parent training was delivered to individuals and not groups. In another study (n = 62), positive effects (once results were adjusted for demographic and baseline data) were reported for the intervention group on a social skills measure.</P>
<P>The study (n = 48) that assessed parenting skill changes compared parent training with a nondirective parent support group. Statistically significant improvements were reported for the parent training group<I>. </I>Two studies (n = 142) provided data on parent stress indices that were suitable for combining in a meta-analysis. The results were significant for the 'child' domain (MD -10.52; 95% CI -20.55 to -0.48) but not the 'parent' domain (MD -7.54; 95% CI -24.38 to 9.30). Results for this outcome from a small study (n = 24) suggested a long-term benefit for mothers who received the intervention at an individual level; in contrast, fathers benefited from short-term group treatment. A fourth study reported change data for within group measures of parental stress and found significant benefits in only one of the two active parent training group arms (P &#8804; 0.01).</P>
<P>No study reported data for academic achievement, adverse events or parental understanding of ADHD.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-24 11:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parent training may have a positive effect on the behaviour of children with ADHD. It may also reduce parental stress and enhance parental confidence. However, the poor methodological quality of the included studies increases the risk of bias in the results. Data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are ambiguous. For many important outcomes, including school achievement and adverse effects, data are lacking.</P>
<P>Evidence from this review is not strong enough to form a basis for clinical practice guidelines. Future research should ensure better reporting of the study procedures and results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and its prevalence</HEADING>
<P>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by high levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before seven years of age. These are seen in a range of situations, are inconsistent with the developmental level of the child and are associated with impairment in social or academic development (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) is similar to ADHD but the criteria are more restrictive. In this review we used the term ADHD to include HKD, although technically HKD defines a more severe subgroup of ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence estimates for ADHD vary considerably and depend on the characteristics of the population, sampling methods and the nature of the assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faraone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sciutto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciutto 2007</LINK>). In a UK survey of 10,438 children aged five to 15 years, <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2003</LINK> found that 3.62% of boys and 0.85% of girls had a diagnosis of ADHD. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA conducted a survey of 102,353 parents with children aged four to 17 years and found a lifetime childhood diagnosis of 7.8% (2.5 times as many boys as girls) of whom 4.3% had received medication as treatment (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>). A review of 50 prevalence studies (including 20 US and 30 non-US sample populations) suggested that the prevalence is similar in US and non-US populations (<LINK REF="REF-Faraone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraone 2003</LINK>). However, the 'administrative' prevalence, that is the frequency of diagnosis in practice, seems to highlight a cultural difference between US and European clinicians as this ratio is estimated to be as high as 20:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Santosh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosh 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comorbidity between ADHD and conduct problems is high. In the British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey, 27% of those with conduct disorder (CD) and 26% of those with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) also qualified for a diagnosis of ADHD, and more than 50% of those with ADHD had a comorbid behaviour disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early conduct problems appear to precede antisocial behaviour in later life. <LINK REF="REF-Farrington-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrington 1995</LINK> estimated that it is possible to predict over half of future recidivist delinquents based on their aggressive behaviour and a family's ineffective child rearing practices.The precise relationship between conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder and ADHD, especially the mechanism of development of antisocial behaviour in children with ADHD, is not, however, fully understood.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>It is thought that genetic and environmental risk factors interact to cause ADHD rather than operate in isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Pliszka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pliszka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). The genetic contribution to observable phenotypic ADHD traits has been estimated as being up to 76% (<LINK REF="REF-Faraone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraone 2005</LINK>). No large single gene effect has been identified but the DRD4 and DRD5 genes appear to be involved (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006</LINK>) and a specific haplotype of the dopamine transporter gene has also been associated with the combined-type ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-Asherson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asherson 2007</LINK>). Findings by <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK> indicated an increased rate of chromosomal deletions and duplications in children with ADHD compared to those without ADHD, suggesting further evidence of genetic influence in ADHD development. Controversial and inaccurate press reporting of this study highlights the need for clarity in communication of complex scientific work by journalists (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFadden-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Possible environmental factors include maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, heroin use in pregnancy, foetal hypoxia and perinatal exposure to toxins, injury and zinc deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Issues regarding diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The diagnosis of ADHD has stimulated considerable debate and sometimes strong and conflicting views (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1999b</LINK>). Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity are normal traits in children, especially young children. There is no reliable test to confirm diagnostic validity, so diagnoses depend on clinical judgment. Consensus among experts in the field (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 2002a</LINK>) might exist but diagnoses may be open to bias. The use of operationalised diagnostic criteria, such as the DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), may reduce such bias. Professional and national bodies that are concerned about the importance of thorough and accurate ADHD diagnoses have issued guidelines to encourage good practice (<LINK REF="REF-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Academy of Pediatrics 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pliszka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pliszka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preschool diagnosis of ADHD is particularly problematic because few data on preschool diagnostic practice exist (<LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 2003a</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lahey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahey 2004</LINK> demonstrated that many four to six year olds continue to meet ADHD diagnostic criteria three years on; however factors such as parental expectations might influence the assessment of the severity of the condition and the extent of impairment it causes. Even where particular symptom levels are judged to be out of the normal range for that age, this might be transitory and reflect normal step-wise or non-linear competency development (<LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 2003a</LINK>). It is a complex process to establish 'caseness' (meeting the criteria for ADHD) where high levels of inattention and hyperactivity exist in a preschool child. The unusual extent of these traits and their association with impairment in the particular child must be demonstrated in order to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Because it is uncertain that this can be done in a systematic and precise way, it has been suggested that making consistent diagnostic assessments in this age group could be problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concerns about diagnostic validity led to the Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kollins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollins 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kollins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollins 2006</LINK> demonstrated that when parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms are examined, DSM-IV symptoms do not consistently act as meaningful discriminators in identifying ADHD and its subtypes; "it may be that other symptoms not routinely assessed in this age group are more saliently associated with ADHD in the preschool years" (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review requires that trial participants have a valid ADHD diagnosis. In view of the concerns about diagnostic validity of ADHD in preschool children 'at risk' of developing ADHD, we decided that this group fell outside the scope of our review. Without definite ADHD diagnoses, uncertainty would exist as to whether any behavioural and symptom changes with the intervention occurred in children truly at risk of developing ADHD, as opposed to those with opposition defiant disorder or conduct disorder or simply going through a particular developmental stage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pharmacological</HEADING>
<P>Over the past decade, a number of systematic reviews on ADHD treatment have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). They conclude that stimulant treatments are relatively safe and effective (at least in the short term) for managing the ADHD core symptoms, which are excessive inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Atomoxetine, a noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, has also been found to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Michelson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2007</LINK>). Professional guidelines recommend pharmacological treatments, with or without concomitant psychosocial interventions, after a comprehensive diagnostic assessment (<LINK REF="REF-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Academy of Pediatrics 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pliszka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pliszka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Whilst consistent treatment with stimulants is associated with maintenance of effectiveness, it is also associated with 'mild' suppression of growth (<LINK REF="REF-MTA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MTA 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adding psychological interventions to medication has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes significantly (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MTA-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MTA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abikoff-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abikoff 2004</LINK>). However, it has been argued that stimulants do not necessarily lead to long-term benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2007</LINK>). Those children with more severe symptoms appear to do better with stimulants than with behavioural interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Santosh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosh 2005</LINK>) but subgroups of ADHD patients with comorbid disorders might respond differentially to pharmacological and psychological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Psychosocial</HEADING>
<P>Over recent years there has been an increased focus on establishing an evidence base of effective psychosocial treatments in ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-Pelham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelham 2008</LINK>). In 1998, Pelham and colleagues reviewed relevant literature and concluded that &#8220;Behavioural Parent Training barely met criteria for well-established treatment&#8221; but met criteria for &#8220;a probably efficacious treatment&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Pelham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelham 1998</LINK>). A decade later, Pelham et al updated this review suggesting that their findings extend the earlier review and demonstrate that behavioural interventions (including behavioural parent training, behavioural classroom management and intensive summer programme-based peer interventions) &#8220;are supported as evidence-based treatments for ADHD&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Pelham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelham 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children diagnosed with ADHD or HKD often have multiple problems, including comorbid disorders such as anxiety, depression and oppositional defiant disorder, as well as relationship difficulties, so multimodal treatment appears to be appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). This might be why, for children with less severe symptoms, safety and user preference may lead to behavioural interventions may being used as a first choice, despite the small advantage of medication over psychological intereventions (<LINK REF="REF-Santosh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosh 2005</LINK>). There are many reasons for considering psychosocial interventions in ADHD, including uncertainity about the long-term effectiveness of stimulants; minimal clinical benefits of medication; nonresponsiveness to medication; weak responsiveness to medication; intolerance to medication; clinical needs of younger children, and ethical and other objections to the use of medication (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-21 09:51:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parent training programmes are psychosocial interventions aimed at training parents in behavioural or cognitive behavioural techniques they can use to manage their children's challenging behaviour. The programmes vary in their style and content but are generally manual-based and may involve discussion and the use of video and role play. One example is Webster-Stratton's Incredible Years programme (<LINK REF="REF-Webster_x002d_Stratton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster-Stratton 1998</LINK>). In addition to the behavioural or cognitive behavioural content fundamental to generic parent training programmes, ADHD-focused parent training often includes psychoeducational components about ADHD and how its presence affects a child's functioning and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Pliszka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pliszka 2007</LINK>). The programmes are typically delivered to groups of parents and usually comprise 10 to 20 weekly sessions of one to two hours covering a range of areas that include the nature of ADHD, positive reinforcement skills (for example, attending carefully to appropriate behaviour and play, as well as how to ignore unwanted behaviour), reward systems, the use of 'time out', liaison with teachers and planning ahead to anticipate problems (<LINK REF="REF-Pliszka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pliszka 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-21 09:56:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main aim of parent training, for children with conduct problems, is "to reduce children&#8217;s problem behaviour by strengthening parent management skills" (<LINK REF="REF-Hartman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartman 2003</LINK>). Parent training interventions are mainly based on behaviour management principles that arise from social-learning theory. They are based on the theory that behaviour can be influenced by its antecedents and consequences and that parents can learn how to intervene with both of these. Parent training usually comprises structured programmes that are delivered in a standardised way by professionals trained in behaviour management theory and practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>More specifically, in families with children who have ADHD parent training may be aimed at improving the parents' understanding of ADHD or increasing their behaviour management skills, or both. Parents may also learn self-management skills aimed at reducing stress and increasing resilience.</P>
<P>In people with ADHD, it is hypothesised that deficits in the brain's executive functioning might result in excessive impulsivity and an altered motivational state may cause delay aversion (<LINK REF="REF-Solanto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solanto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 2003b</LINK>). Hypothetically, to improve ADHD symptoms parent training could be designed to work on both of these areas, through cognitive work on self-regulation and through motivational interventions focusing on improving delay tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 2003b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-24 13:09:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Longitudinal research suggests that hyperactivity, in particular, is a risk factor for future problems (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sourander-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sourander 2005</LINK>). Unfavourable long-term outcomes include educational and occupational impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannuzza-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannuzza 1997</LINK>), an increased risk of antisocial personality disorder and substance misuse (<LINK REF="REF-Mannuzza-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannuzza 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>) and an increased risk of "psychiatric diagnosis, persisting hyperactivity, violence and other conduct problems and social and peer problems" (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Problem behaviours are viewed in two broad dimensions. Externalising problems include conflict with others, aggression, rulebreaking and oppositional behaviour, whereas internalising problems are those where stress is directed against the self, such as anxiety, depression, somatic problems and social withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Sourander-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sourander 2005</LINK>). The National Survey of Health and Development, a 40-year cohort study, followed up 3652 adolescents with externalising problems. It found that those with externalising behaviour problems are impaired in their health and social development in multiple ways, with considerable impact on themselves, their families and society throughout adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Parent training can improve behaviour in children with conduct disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006a</LINK>) and children with behaviour problems (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1997</LINK>). There is also some support for the effectiveness of group-based parenting programmes in improving the emotional and behavioural adjustment in children under the age of three years (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, it may be effective in children who have both conduct disorder and the ADHD core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (<LINK REF="REF-Hartman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The economic cost of antisocial behaviour to society is considerable and cuts across multiple agencies. When costs were applied to data from the Inner London longitudinal study, it was reported that those with conduct disorder cost 10 times more than those without (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2001b</LINK>). Parent training programmes for conduct disorder are effective (<LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchings-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchings 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2007</LINK>) yet until relatively recently they attracted little funding. This was despite the fact that the effect size of these interventions is comparable to that of antidepressant medication in depressed adults (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although comorbidity exists between ADHD and conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, it is not clear that parent training in children with ADHD, with or without comorbid conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, is effective for reducing antisocial behaviour or ADHD symptoms. Although NICE recommend parent training as a treatment intervention in ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>), this recommendation is based on studies of children under 12 years with conduct disorder rather than with ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006a</LINK>). They nonetheless recommend that clinical services provide all parents or carers of preschool children a parent training or education programme as first-line treatment. They also suggest that parents or carers of school age children with moderate ADHD symptom impairment be offered parent training programmes and that school-aged children be offered a group treatment programme involving cognitive behavioural therapy or social skills training, or both (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the high comorbidity between ADHD and conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, it is understandable that NICE have made these recommendations but the relationship between parent training and ADHD needs to be examined in its own right. The mechanism for development of behaviour problems might be different for the two conditions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Where sufficient clinical and methodological homogeneity existed between trials, we pooled results. We remained mindful of the dangers of interpreting findings of single or even multiple studies in the absence of meta-analysis. Where meta-analysis was not possible, for example where outcomes measured different domains such as 'ADHD core symptoms' and 'educational achievement', we provided the reasons and reported investigators&#8217; findings narratively.</P>
<P>Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) was used to conduct meta-analysis where feasible. We calculated overall effects using inverse variance methods (we planned to undertake both fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses and report data accordingly). We anticipated that included studies would yield heterogeneous data because of diagnostic variability in ADHD and differences in the parent training models used by different researchers, and we were correct in our assumptions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple arms</HEADING>
<P>All relevant outcomes for all eligible trial arms were reported in the review.</P>
<P>When two or more eligible intervention groups were compared to an eligible control, the review authors considered (as planned in the protocol) combining data for interventions provided each met all inclusion criteria and did not involve unacceptable adjunct treatments, for example direct work with children. We used the methods recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008c</LINK>) to combine data from the two 'active treatment' arms of the three-arm trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> (parent training versus parent training and self-management versus control).</P>
<P>At protocol stage we planned the following: "If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, 'no-treatment' controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsey 2001</LINK>). For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most appropriate eligible alternative will be chosen (see list of comparisons, above)". This decision led us to accept the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lehner_x002d_Dua-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lehner-Dua 2001</LINK> as we judged her parent support group to be synonymous with an 'attentional control'. We could not be certain of trials such as <LINK REF="STD-Lauth-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lauth 2007</LINK>, wherein the 'parent support' arm of the trial involved intensive discussion of themes pre-chosen by intervention organisers to mirror those being taught in the more active parent training intervention arm.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple measures</HEADING>
<P>When a single study provided multiple measures of the same outcome (for example, two measures for ADHD symptoms), we planned at protocol stage to average the effects from the outcomes to arrive at a single effect for use in the meta-analysis. In the event, this was not feasible in the one instance it occurred. We therefore reported separate subscales of the ADDES-HOME scale (Hyperactivity and Inattentiveness) in the one trial using these measures (<LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK>). These scales measure different aspects of ADHD symptomatology and it was therefore inappropriate to combine them in a meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>To be included in this review, ADHD had to be the main focus of the trial and participants had to have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD made by a specialist using operationalised diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV, or its earlier versions, or a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder using ICD-10 (see under 'Inclusion criteria' below).</P>
<P>Participants included within the review ranged in age from four to 13 years old. Ranges, means and standard deviations, where provided, were as follows.</P>

<P>Most children entered the studies on medication for ADHD symptoms (see below for further details, as reported in the individual studies). In general, where reported, participants had to be stablised on medication throughout the trial and this was established prior to randomisation.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blakemore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blakemore 1993</LINK> used DSM-III-R criteria for ADHD. The children had to demonstrate evidence of ADHD in a wide range of situations and the problems must have been evident before the age of six years. <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> included participants who had to be diagnosed with ADHD using DSM-IV criteria. Fallone also required a high level of maternal stress for inclusion in the training programme. <LINK REF="STD-Lehner_x002d_Dua-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lehner-Dua 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK> used DSM-IV criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Mikami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mikami 2010</LINK> reported that DSM-IV criteria were used (that is the proportion of those of Combined type (ADHD-C) and Inattentive type (ADHD-I) were reported). In this study, diagnoses were further reinforced and refined using the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) (<LINK REF="REF-Gadow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadow 1994</LINK>) and confirmed by parental interview using the K-SADS-PL (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK> included participants who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, had an IQ &gt; 80 (full scale IQ of the WISC-III-R; for children under the age of six years the Full Scale IQ of the QWPPSI-R) and were four to 12 years old. In addition, both parents (if present) had to be willing to participate in the behavioural parent training program. All participants in the trial were offered a comprehensive package of routine clinical care (RCC) including psychological treatment, pharmacological treatment and crisis management, where necessary, with the parent training component being offered as the only difference between the groups. The control group were also offered the intervention after a waitlist period, described as shorter than the one they might have faced had they not participated in the trial (it was hoped that this would improve retention in the control group).<BR/>

<P>Many studies which appeared (by title or even abstract) to be of interest did not ultimately meet our inclusion criteria. Some studies were excluded for more than one reason. Primary reasons for exclusion are listed below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Lack of random allocation or a control group</HEADING>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised studies were eligible for this review. Of the 68 intervention studies identified and inspected for this review, 64 were (at a minimum) controlled intervention studies.</P>
<P>Seven studies were excluded because participants were not randomly or quasi-randomly allocated to intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Anastopoulos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anastopoulos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bandsma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bandsma 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salbach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 2008</LINK>). In these studies, it was usually found (sometimes only after contact with investigators) that allocation was by self-selection on the part of parents, or that groups had been formed by clinical severity alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bandsma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bandsma 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies were excluded because, although they were intervention studies, they proved to have no control group at all (<LINK REF="STD-Pollard-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pollard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danforth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Danforth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arnold-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hautmann-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hautmann 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fourteen studies included no eligible control group (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barkley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montiel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Montiel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corrin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corrin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Isler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corkum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Corkum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGoey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McGoey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabiano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markie_x002d_Dadds-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Markie-Dadds 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauth-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lauth 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 2008</LINK>). The latter group of studies generally compared active interventions only; in some cases they also failed to meet diagnostic criteria for children.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Direct intervention of therapist with child</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen studies (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MTA-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MTA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abikoff-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abikoff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chronis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chronis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Springer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Springer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waschbusch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Waschbusch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miranda-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miranda 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bogle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chacko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chacko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubbs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molina-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Molina 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Oord-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van der Oord 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coughlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Coughlin 2009</LINK>) were excluded because their intervention directly involved the child.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Problems with diagnosis or diagnostic criteria</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen studies were excluded because, although investigators may have described the children as having ADHD, there was no clear ADHD diagnosis made that met our inclusion criteria, or the children were too young for this review (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Leary-1976" TYPE="STUDY">O'Leary 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dubey 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pisterman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pisterman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pisterman-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Pisterman 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barkley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sonuga-Barke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barkley-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sonuga-Barke 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gustis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heriot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heriot 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK>). Readers interested in the results of studies that focus primarily on the young with subclinical behavioural problems may be interested in the results of another Cochrane review, when complete (<LINK REF="REF-Furlong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlong 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies were excluded as the children had behavioural problems due to other conditions including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) (<LINK REF="STD-Nixon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavigne-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lavigne 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2010</LINK>), pervasive developmental disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Aman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aman 2010</LINK>) or being 'gifted' (<LINK REF="STD-Morawska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morawska 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Focus of the study</HEADING>
<P>Two studies were excluded due to intervention type: <LINK REF="STD-Chronis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chronis 2006</LINK> because the intervention targeted maternal depression amongst mothers of children with ADHD, and was assessed as not meeting the inclusion criteria for parent training; and <LINK REF="STD-Wolraich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wolraich 2005</LINK> because the intervention sought to improve communication between parents, teachers and clinicians rather than to manage child behaviour.</P>
<P>Two studies narrowly missed inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scahill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scahill 2006</LINK>) because ADHD was not the main focus of the trial, which rendered data interpretation problematic. <LINK REF="STD-Scahill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scahill 2006</LINK> recruited children with tic disorders and disruptive behaviour from a specialised tic disorders clinic, and specifically excluded children with untreated ADHD. This yielded a subset of children with comorbid, medicated ADHD (investigators further responded to our request for subset data with the view that this sample was too small to analyse meaningfully (<LINK REF="REF-Scahill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scahill 2008</LINK>)). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2001a</LINK> took pains to exclude children diagnosed with the ICD-10 diagnosis of 'hyperkinetic syndrome' precisely because he wished to exclude medicated children with ADHD from his study. We have recently learned from a personal communication that, despite the fact that the published paper does not refer to any child having a diagnosis of ADHD, a substantial proportion of participants did, posthoc, merit this diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2011</LINK>) and that unpublished data for this subset exist. Yet these participants, given the exclusion criteria, were solely unmedicated children with ADHD. Thus we concluded that, in the absence of an underpinning focus on ADHD, a risk of bias (in that children with ADHD will have been excluded from both studies who would have been included in other included studies) might 'skew' the results of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">No child outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Odom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Odom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corkum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Corkum 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treacy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Treacy 2005</LINK>) were excluded because although the studies involved parents of children with ADHD, and sequence generation was adequate for the eligible intervention and control groups, no outcomes relating to the child's behaviour or well being (ADHD-related or not) were reported. In these studies, outcomes typically included parental stress, parental knowledge of ADHD and willingness to medicate children or seek counselling.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Opinion pieces and review articles</HEADING>
<P>Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-Rogers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan Rogers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauth_x002d_Charlier-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth-Charlier 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reeves-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Reeves 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoppe_x002d_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoppe-Sullivan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baker_x002d_Ericzen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baker-Ericzen 2010</LINK>) were excluded because they were found to be review articles, opinion pieces or other types of studies when obtained and inspected. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Schoppe_x002d_Sullivan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoppe-Sullivan 2009</LINK>, whilst tagged as a randomised controlled trial in MEDLINE, proved to be an observational study considering parents' own ADHD symptoms in relation to their parenting practices.</P>

<P>As is common with psychological interventions, especially where outcomes are self-reported, there is inherent bias given the impossibility of blinding participants or those delivering interventions to treatment status. For this reason, despite the best intentions of researchers, the overall risk of bias in all studies is high. Where outcomes are not self-reported, outcome assessors can and should be kept blind.</P>
<P>We rated two studies as having high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehner_x002d_Dua-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lehner-Dua 2001</LINK>); two as being unclear (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mikami 2010</LINK>); and one as being at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Blakemore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blakemore 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Original trial protocols were not available for any study in this review. Data for all reasonable outcomes for each study appear to have been reported.

<P>The ADHD Index subscale of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form (CPRS-R-S) (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 2001</LINK>) was used by <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK>. Within this 27 item scale, a higher number indicates greater psychopathology. <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> employed the ADDES-Home (<LINK REF="REF-McCarney-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 1995</LINK>) to measure this construct, wherein a higher value indicates less severity. Pooling results for <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> for this outcome was not possible, even using standardised mean difference and compensating for opposing directions of scales, as the ADDES scale is divided into two subscales (the Hyperactive-Impulsive scale and the ADDES-Inattentive scale) (<LINK REF="REF-McCarney-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 1995</LINK>) but is not a combined measure. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK> reported endpoint data and <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> reported only change data in full (means and standard deviations).

<P>Using the CPRS, <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoofdakker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoofdakker 2007</LINK> (n = 62) reported that, with respect to the ADHD Index of the CPRS, both groups (intervention plus routine clinical care (RCC) and RCC alone) improved, but that adjunctive parent training was not significantly better than with RCC alone. Results for the intervention group were: 19.0 (SD = 6.2) versus 18.7 (SD = 7.7) for the RCC control group.</P>
<P>On the ADDES-Home's Hyperactive-Impulsive scale, <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> reported that both the parent training (PT) and enhanced parent training treatment (PT and self-management (SM)) groups did rate significantly better than control (mean of PT alone = 7.50 (calculated SD = 1.64); mean of PT and SM group = 7.46 (calculated SD = 1.64); mean of control group = 5.69 (calculated SD = 1.84)).</P>

The TRF includes a Total Problems and a Total Externalizing and Total Internalizing scale (see note below), whereas the ADDES-School comprises Inattentive and Hyperactive-Impulsive scales. <LINK REF="STD-Fallone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fallone 1998</LINK> reported no numerical data for either of these instruments. <LINK REF="STD-Mikami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mikami 2010</LINK> reported results for the Teacher Questionnaire Measures of child social functioning (SSRS) and the teacher-assessed Dishion Social Acceptance Scale (DSAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Dishion-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dishion 2003</LINK>) to consider children's progress in this domain.

<P>The Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) (<LINK REF="REF-Eyberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyberg 1999</LINK>) was used by <LINK REF="STD-Blakemore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blakemore 1993</LINK> (n = 24). Means are not supplied in the text or any table but they are supplied separately for mothers and fathers plotted on a graph that is difficult to interpret. No SDs are given. The investigators' own interpretation is as follows: "According to this measure (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) there were significant declines for mothers in the frequency of problem behaviours for both individual and group treatment relative to controls, although the effects were stronger for individual [treatment]. Data for fathers indicated a significant decline in the frequency of problem behaviours only for individual treatment relative to controls" (p 81). The investigators add that "effects for group treatment in fathers were not possible to evaluate because of large pre-treatment differences relative to both individual and control treatments". Investigators summarised their data as follows: "there appears to be stronger treatment effects for individual than group treatment and stronger effects for mothers than fathers" and that the former persist at follow-up and that the latter do not.</P>
<P>Investigators from the <LINK REF="STD-Mikami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mikami 2010</LINK> study (n = 62) reported results for the SSRS for the intervention group (parental friendship coaching (PFC)) as 90.86 (SD = 14.68) versus 83.87 (SD = 16.28) in the control group. After accounting for "demographic covariates and baseline parent reports on the SSRS", there was a "between small and medium" effect size between intervention and control, and no interactions appeared to exist between treatment and sex, medication or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) status.</P>
<P>Investigators from <LINK REF="STD-Mikami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mikami 2010</LINK> (n = 62) (wherein the target of the intervention was children's social development) reported results for the SSRS (Teacher Questionnaire) for the intervention group (PFC) as 92.38 (SD = 12.90) versus 86.45 (SD = 10.92) in the control group. The investigators reported that this difference was not significant; however, there was an interaction between treatment and ODD status. This indicated that the effect on teacher reports of child social skills may have been generally positive for the children without ODD who had received PFC (beta = 0.16; P = - 0.04) but was not significant for those with ODD (beta = -0.09; P = 0.47).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-10-22 08:58:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Morris Zwi">
<P>We found few trials that examined whether parent training reduced ADHD symptoms and associated difficulties in children. These generally supported the use of parent training, as is used in current practice, especially in improving outcomes related to the child's general behaviour. However, the overall quality of the studies was poor. Most were small and took place in developed countries (the majority in North America); they did not all examine outcomes linked to core problems of the child's ADHD and had limited post-intervention follow-up. Selective reporting of trial outcomes was a problem in this review. Obtaining data where it was missing or incomplete was not possible in all cases despite efforts to contact authors. Some were untraceable, especially where the studies were completed some time ago (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Blakemore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blakemore 1993</LINK>) and where it was essential to supplement the limited published graphical data. Exact details on medication regimes of the children within studies were not invariably explicit. On a more positive note, all included studies gave clear, detailed accounts of the parent training interventions, including the content, duration and frequency of sessions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-22 09:02:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review found limited evidence of sufficient methodological rigour and with adequate reporting to confidently assess the clinical effects of parent training interventions for children with ADHD. Overall the trials were few in number (five), small in size (numbers ranged from 24 to 96), and provided little information about core issues to allow us to assess risk of bias (such as methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and completeness of outcome data). With the best intentions of investigators, some of the risks of bias in this review, for example blinding, cannot be overcome in the context of a trial delivering a psychosocial intervention that is then primarily assessed by the recipient of that intervention (a parent). Other methodological weaknesses are, however, in the control of investigators. These include the duty to report all outcome data consistently and fully and not, for example, only to do so if a significant positive result was achieved; or only to report data from one set of observers (for example, mothers and not fathers) or to fail to assess treatment fidelity (a key measure of whether even a successful programme can be 'rolled out' in the wider world). The extent to which a Cochrane review can draw conclusions about the effects of an intervention depends on whether the data and results from the included studies are valid. In particular, invalid studies may produce misleading results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>). Overall, the internal validity of studies in this review has limitations.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-10-24 12:55:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical work with children or young people with ADHD usually involves seeing both the identified patient and their family. In order to ascertain the effect of the parent training component of this intervention, we restricted inclusion criteria to trials in which there was no direct intervention involving the child or young person. We therefore excluded trials such as the <LINK REF="STD-MTA-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MTA 1999</LINK>, which included a parent training component but also involved direct work with the children. Similarly, we excluded trials of parent training in children with antisocial behaviour or disruptive behaviour disorders if the trials were not primarily focused on ADHD. This may therefore narrow the generalisability of the results of this review when considering interventions for children with comorbid conditions.</P>
<P>Our inclusion criteria also required participants for whom "the main problem is ADHD" and where the diagnoses "should be clinical diagnoses by specialists" (as opposed to trained or untrained researchers using instruments such as semi-structured interviews). Had inclusion criteria been less restrictive, we might have been able to include subsets of children from trials where the main focus of the trial was antisocial or disruptive behaviour rather than ADHD.</P>
<P>However, without the main focus being on ADHD, the children in subsets of data obtained from these trials would not have been typical of children with ADHD. Two excluded trials illustrate this in opposite ways. <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2001a</LINK> excluded the more severe children with "hyperkinetic syndrome" at recruitment, yet later found that "a good half" of their participants nevertheless met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2011</LINK>). The primary outcome of this trial was antisocial behaviour and by excluding the more severe cases, those that remained no longer reflected the wider spectrum of ADHD (even those who had attempted to 'manage' the condition). On the other hand, a trial by <LINK REF="STD-Scahill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scahill 2006</LINK> involving children with disruptive behaviour and tics included 10 children with ADHD, all receiving stimulant medication (and indeed, those with "untreated ADHD" had no chance of entering the trial). Had we included these trial subsets, whichever trial had the larger number of identified ADHD cases may have biased the ADHD sample in terms of severity and co-intervention.</P>
<P>As the primary focus of this review was the effects of parent training on change in child symptoms and behaviour, we restricted primary outcomes to child outcomes rather than parent outcomes. We excluded studies with parent outcomes only (for example, reduction in parental stress), which may have introduced some bias to this review. However, only three such trials were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Corkum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Corkum 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Odom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Odom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treacy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Treacy 2005</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-Treacy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Treacy 2005</LINK> could have added weight to our finding that parent training reduces parental stress, the loss of usable data from the three trials overall was small.</P>
<P>We may have failed to identify small studies because of a degree of publishing bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) operating in this review, but do not think we would not have found large relevant studies. The low number of studies in this review is likely to be an artefact of investigators turning increasingly to 'add on' treatments, which do not meet our inclusion criteria, or the lack of inclusion of a no treatment control. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Fabiano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiano 2006</LINK> the primary investigator wished to have a no treatment control but was not permitted to as the ethics committee was so convinced of the effectiveness of parent training that it rejected a plea by a funded investigator to incorporate a no-treatment control arm in the RCT.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-10-24 12:44:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NICE recommend parent training as a treatment intervention in ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>) based on evidence from children under 12 years with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006a</LINK>). Their review did not, however, examine the evidence on parent training in children with ADHD specifically. We are not able to firmly support their recommendation based on the trials we examined. We found some evidence, though not strong, to support parent training in ADHD.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1998</LINK> found little evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions in ADHD whereas <LINK REF="REF-Pelham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelham 2008</LINK> suggests that a number of psychosocial interventions are effective.</P>
<P>The narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Modesto_x002d_Lowe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modesto-Lowe 2008</LINK> discusses studies on parenting children in ADHD, including the co-occurrence of ADHD and childhood disruptive disorders, psychiatric disorders in parents of children with ADHD, and optimising parental-child interactions. They suggest that there may be "high levels of child rearing stressors induced by the child's ADHD symptoms" on parents, with the focus of the studies mainly being on mothers and sons. Results of this review confirm that parent training appears to reduce parental stress.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Modesto_x002d_Lowe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modesto-Lowe 2008</LINK> also mentions that "the degree of parental dysfunction appears to correlate with the presence and severity of ADHD-related disruptive disorders such as ODD and CD" and that there "is evidence to suggest that poor parental skills may exacerbate children's self-control deficits and contribute to the development of additional disruptive disorders that worsen ADHD outcomes". A study by Sonuga-Barke 2002 similarly found that treatment of parental ADHD might be necessary to ensure effectiveness of parent training. The ADHD symptoms of children of parents without ADHD improved following parent training compared to the lack of ADHD symptom improvement in children of mothers with ADHD symptoms. This issue was not addressed by any of the studies included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Modesto_x002d_Lowe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modesto-Lowe 2008</LINK> also states that "early treatment, positive parenting and the absence of comorbidity may all optimize functioning and likely improve the course of the disorder". We only looked at school-aged children, which may have excluded very early treatment. None of the included studies directly addressed this issue.  </P>

<P>There is some indication that parent training may have a positive effect on difficulties experienced by children with ADHD, particularly in terms of general behaviour. Data are more encouraging for the parents and carers of such children (in whom parent training may well be of benefit in reducing parental stress and building a sense of parental confidence). However, data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are more ambiguous. The poor methodological quality of the studies overall makes it likely that there is bias in the results and weakens any conclusions that may be drawn in this review. For many important outcomes, including school achievement and adverse effects, data for this intervention are lacking.</P>
<P>Overall, data from this review do not provide sufficiently strong evidence on which to base recommendations for practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-07 16:03:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-designed, randomised controlled trials within this population are needed and should be reported clearly in accordance with the principles set out in the CONSORT 2010 Statement (www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/). Measurement of treatment outcome is often limited to parent and teacher completed questionnaires and could be extended to include, for example, health-related quality of life outcomes (HRQL) (<LINK REF="REF-Klassen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 2004</LINK>). Trials need to collect information about adverse events related to any intervention. Researchers should consider child outcomes and not only focus on reduction of parental stress or sense of competence. Child outcomes may also include HRQL (<LINK REF="REF-Klassen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 2004</LINK>), social interactions with peers, family interactions and school achievement.</P>
<P>As comorbidity is so common in ADHD, further research with children displaying disruptive behaviour disorders should address these comorbid conditions and not focus on only one area, for example, ADHD or ODD/CD. The effects of gender, both that of the parent and child, should be carefully considered. Many parents and young people wish to limit the exposure of children to psychoactive medication, so it may be useful to explore whether this might be achieved through psychosocial interventions targeted at those most likely to benefit from them.</P>
<P>Furthermore, a complementary review of parent training for parents of children under the age of five years who have been assessed as 'at risk' of ADHD would be a timely addition to literature in this area.</P>

<U>Behavioural Parent Training + Routine Clinical Care:</U> Manual based parent training consisted of 12 x 120 minute group sessions over 5 months for 6 children's parents at a time. Sessions led by two psychologists, specific target behaviours were established for each child. Most techniques were drawn from Barkley (1987) and Forehand &amp; McHahon (1981). Parenting skills addressed were: structuring the environment, setting rules, giving instructions, anticipating misbehaviors, communicating, reinforcing positive behaviour, ignoring, employing punishment, and implementing a token system. Psychoeducation and restructuring of parental cognitions were also important elements. Homework assignments were given and parents read chapters from a specially written book by van der Veen-Mulders (2001). Each week parents practiced the skills and wrote reports after the exercises. Follow up assessment 25 weeks post-intervention.<BR/>
<U>Routine Clinical Care:</U> Carried out by four experienced senior child and adolescent psychiatrists. They provided care as usual including supportive counselling, psychoeducation, pharmacotherapy, and crisis management whenever necessary. Checkups were usually every 3-6 months. Parents were given the group parent training after all data had been collected.</P>

<U>Participants:</U> Participants were families of 62 children (42 boys) with ADHD. A comparison group of &#8216;normal&#8217; children (62 age- and sex-matched children) were also recruited. Diagnoses of those with ADHD were made via Child Symptom Inventory (CSI, <LINK REF="REF-Gadow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadow 1994</LINK>) and diagnoses were verified in a clinical review with parents using the K-SAD (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1997</LINK>). Majority of children with ADHD were DSM-IV Combined Type (ADHD-C; n = 46) and the remainder were DSM-IV Inattentive Type (ADHD-I; n = 16). Data on ethnicity provided for the whole sample. Most children (85%) classed as white, 5% African American, 2% Asian American, 1% Latino and 7% of more than one race. Each child participated with one parent &#8216;most involved in a child&#8217;s social life&#8217;, 94% of whom were female. Children on medication (n = 40) for 3 months prior to study were permitted to continue on the same regime.</P>

<U>Parental friendship coaching (PFC</U>) was provided in eight 90 minute group sessions, delivered once weekly, involving 5 to 6 parents and led by two clinicians. The parent who had originally completed questionnaire and attended baseline playgroup assessment was requested to attend PFC, but other parent could attend if wished. Sessions were manualised. One month after the study ended, parents were contacted by phone and interviewed regarding changes in their child&#8217;s peer relationships.</P>
<P>Topic I: Setting a foundation for effective coaching by improving the parent-child relationship<BR/>Session 1: Building a positive parent-child relationship by using &#8216;attending&#8217; and &#8216;special time&#8217;; How antecedents and consequences shape behaviour<BR/>Session 2: Using active listening when discussing child&#8217;s social concerns; providing effective praise and constructive feedback to your child<BR/>Topic II: Coaching your child in social skills needed for good peer relationships<BR/>Session 3: Teaching child good dyadic play skills<BR/>Session 4: Choosing the right peer to foster a friendship with your child; Meeting new friends through unstructured and organised activities<BR/>Topic III: Organising playdates that will foster the development of good friendships<BR/>Session 5: Inviting a peer for a playdate; how parents can network with other parents and set a good social example<BR/>Session 6: Preparing the playdate setting as the host to prevent boredom and conflict among the children<BR/>Session 7: Debriefing with your child after the playdate; Preparing your child for a playdate as a guest<BR/>Topic IV: Review and future directions<BR/>Session 8: Recap of skills taught; reasons for backsliding; what to expect in the future</P>
<P>Homework issued with each session involving worksheets, practice sessions, discussions with the child and setting up playdates.  Group viewing of videotapes of parental interaction was used as a teaching tool.</P>

<P>RCT design acceptable; parent training programme and controls acceptable; outcomes acceptable. Diagnosis remained difficult to assess, even after personal communication with investigators and after reading multiple publications. According to an early publication, participants were "those who received a possible or definitive diagnosis of ODD and/or CD after assessment after all clinically referred children were first screened by means of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) using the 90th percentile as a cut-off score according to Norwegian norms. Children who attained such a cut-off score or higher were subsequently interviewed by one of three trained interviewers using the KIDDIE-SADS" (Drugli, p 393). Subsequent contact with Dr Drugli suggested that subset ADHD children were similarly diagnosed (i.e. by trained interviewers but not specialists). In the paper published by Larsson et al (2008) authors report subset for "definitive" ADHD participants; but in the paper by Fossum et al (2008) authors admit as a limitation of the study that "the assessment of clinical levels of ADHD did not meet the formal criteria of a diagnosis."</P>

<P>Multicentre RCT involving parenting groups for children who were recruited for antisocial behaviour rather than ADHD. "Eligible children were all those aged 3-8 years who were referred for antisocial behaviour to their local multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health service" (p 2). From the text, it would appear investigators strenuously sought to exclude ADHD, as they listed as exclusion criteria for their trial: "clinically apparent major developmental delay, hyperkinetic syndrome [ICD-10 criteria for inclusion within this review] or any other condition requiring separate treatment". ADHD is not mentioned in the published study. Personal contact with the author (Scott 2011) concerning a different study (Scott 2010) led to a disclosure that approximately half the study's participants subsequently proved to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD (although the age of such children remains unclear) and data were generously provided.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous (binary) data, the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be used to summarise results within each study. The odds ratio is chosen because it has statistical advantages relating to its sampling distribution and its suitability for modelling, and because it is a relative measure and so can be used to combine studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Categorical data</HEADING>
<P>Where results are reported in short ordinal scales, the methods of Whitehead and Jones will be used to produce a single odds ratio from each trial (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1994</LINK>). If sufficient detail is not available we will consider analysing such scales as continuous data, after investigating skew and appropriateness.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>Where trials have used clustered randomisation, we anticipate that study investigators would have presented their results after appropriately controlling for clustering effects (robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If it is unclear whether a cluster-randomised trial has used appropriate controls for clustering, the study investigators will be contacted for further information. Where appropriate controls were not used, individual participant data will be requested and re-analysed using multilevel models which control for clustering. Following this, effect sizes and standard errors will be meta-analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse method (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). If appropriate controls were not used and individual participant data is not available, statistical guidance will be sought from the Cochrane Methods Group and external experts as to which method to apply to the published results in an attempt to control for clustering. Our preferred method (if there is insufficient information to control for clustering) will be to perform a sensitivity analysis assuming a variety of intraclass correlations (ICCs) from standard tables or using those from other similar studies in the field. As a last resort, outcome data may be entered into RevMan using individuals as the units of analysis, and then sensitivity analysis will be used to assess the potential biasing effects of inadequately controlled clustered trials (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>To investigate the possibility of reporting biases, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>;). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses, given concerns raised in Chapter 10.4.2 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We plan also to address the issue of selective outcome reporting by checking against the included studies' protocols if possible (within trial registries, conference proceedings, etc.), and by internal evidence within the published studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups:</P>
<UL>
<LI>children receiving concomitant drug treatment;</LI>
<LI>parent training programmes that are group based versus individual or couple based programmes;</LI>
<LI>parent training programmes that involve a teacher component.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will be carried out:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to consider the impact of differing ratings on pre-specified 'Risk of bias' criteria, especially to assess whether results are sensitive to restricting the analyses to studies judged to be at low risk of bias with regard to: (a) selection bias (associated with sequence generation or allocation concealment); (b) only studies with low risk of attrition bias (associated with completeness of data);</LI>
<LI>to analyse the differential impact of true versus 'quasi' randomised studies;</LI>
<LI>to compare studies in which fidelity testing was undertaken compared to those where it was not done.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses.</P>
