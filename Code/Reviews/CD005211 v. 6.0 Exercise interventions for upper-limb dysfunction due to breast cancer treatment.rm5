<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know about the effect of exercise on arm and shoulder movement problems due to breast cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Upper-limb dysfunction following breast cancer surgery: </B>
</P>
<P>The use of upper-limb ROM, stretching and strengthening exercises after breast cancer surgery have been shown to improve recovery of shoulder movement. However, there are different views on what type of exercise is best and how soon exercises should be started following surgery. Moreover, it is not known if exercise is helpful in addressing upper-limb problems that persist following surgery and there is some concern that upper-limb exercise may increase the risk of developing lymphedema in the arm. In this review, a total of 24 studies examined the benefit of exercise on upper-limb dysfunction. Ten studies examined whether it was better to start exercise early after surgery or to delay exercise by about one week. Six studies examined structured exercise programs compared to usual care (exercise pamphlet or no exercise) following surgery. Three studies examined exercise interventions carried out during cancer treatment and five studies examined exercise interventions carried out following cancer treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of the effect of upper-limb exercise for women with breast cancer: </B>
</P>
<P>1) This review found that upper-limb exercise (e.g. shoulder ROM and stretching) is helpful in recovering upper-limb movement following surgery for breast cancer. Starting exercise early after surgery (day 1 to day 3) may result in better shoulder movement in the short term; however, it may also result in more wound drainage and require the drains to be in place longer than if exercise is delayed by about one week.</P>
<P>2) This review showed that more structured exercise programs, such as physical therapy, delivered in the early weeks following surgery are beneficial to regain movement in, and use of the shoulder and arm for daily activities such as reaching overhead.</P>
<P>3) This review did not find any evidence that upper-limb exercise, whether carried out following surgery, or during/ following other cancer treatments, resulted in more patients developing arm lymphedema.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-10 14:01:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We included 24 studies involving 2132 participants. Ten of the 24 were considered of adequate methodological quality.</P>
<P>Ten studies examined the effect of early versus delayed implementation of post-operative exercise. Implementing early exercise was more effective than delayed exercise in the short term recovery of shoulder flexion ROM (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD): 10.6 degrees; 95% Confidence Interval (CI):  4.51 to 16.6); however, early exercise also resulted in a statistically significant increase in wound drainage volume (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.49) and duration (WMD: 1.15 days; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.65).</P>
<P>Fourteen studies examined the effect of structured exercise compared to usual care/comparison. Of these, six were post-operative, three during adjuvant treatment and five following cancer treatment. Structured exercise programs in the post-operative period significantly improved shoulder flexion ROM in the short-term (WMD: 12.92 degrees; 95% CI:  0.69 to 25.16). Physical therapy treatment yielded additional benefit for shoulder function post-intervention (SMD: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.21) and at six-month follow-up (SMD: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.19). There was no evidence of increased risk of lymphedema from exercise at any time point.</P>

<P>Exercise can result in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in shoulder ROM in women with breast cancer. In the post-operative period, consideration should be given to early implementation of exercises, although this approach may need to be carefully weighed against the potential for increases in wound drainage volume and duration. High quality research studies that closely monitor exercise prescription factors (e.g. intensity), and address persistent upper-limb dysfunction are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:48:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:48:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Upper-limb dysfunction is commonly reported as a side effect of breast cancer treatment and may include one or more of the following impairments: decreased shoulder range of motion (the range through which a joint can be moved) (ROM) and strength, pain and lymphedema (an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the tissue of the hand, arm, breast and/or trunk) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gosselink-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosselink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reitman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reitman 2003</LINK>). A systematic review examining upper-limb symptoms following surgery and radiation therapy found a wide variation among studies in the reported prevalence of impaired shoulder ROM (&lt; 1% to 67%), arm weakness (9% to 28%), shoulder/arm pain (9% to 68%), and lymphedema (0% to 34%) (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>). Despite the reported variability, it is clear from the literature that many breast cancer survivors present with upper-limb dysfunction that may persist for many years following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Reitman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Senkus_x002d_Konefka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senkus-Konefka 2006</LINK>). More recently, the presence of upper-limb dysfunction in breast cancer survivors has been found to have a negative impact on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-07 05:50:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exercise interventions include a range of rehabilitative exercises aimed at preventing, minimizing or improving shoulder ROM, upper-limb strength and function, pain and lymphedema. An exercise program may include active, active-assisted, and/or passive ROM exercises, stretching or movement exercises, and upper-limb strengthening exercises. Exercises may also include manual stretching or ROM techniques, applied by a physical therapist or manual therapist, that are performed to restore muscular length and joint mobility. Exercise programs may be self-directed or supervised by a healthcare professional such as a physical or occupational therapist, or exercise specialist.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-18 12:13:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exercise is prescribed to restore shoulder joint mobility, movement and strength in muscles of the upper-limb, and to reduce pain (<LINK REF="STD-Box-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Box 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>). Thus, exercise helps optimize function of the upper-limb (the ability to perform a physical activity or task). Exercise is believed to be most beneficial when it is continued over an extended period of time following surgery (e.g. 6 to 12 months) as soft tissues heal and remodel (<LINK REF="REF-Box-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Box 1998</LINK>).   </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:48:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>At present, there are many gaps in our knowledge on the benefits of exercise at different time points over the course of breast cancer treatment and recovery. Some controversy remains over the optimal time to start upper-limb exercise following surgery, the appropriate type and intensity of post-operative exercise, and the relative benefit of exercise in addressing late onset or persistent upper-limb dysfunction in breast cancer survivors. </P>
<P>There is some concern that unskilled or early aggressive shoulder movement performed immediately post-operatively may interfere with the regeneration of lymphatic channels potentially damaged by the surgery, and increase the amount and duration of wound drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Box-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Box 2002</LINK>). An increase in wound drainage may result in delayed wound healing, seroma formation, increase the risk of infection, and has been found to parallel the incidence of long-term lymphedema (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tadych-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tadych 1987</LINK>). Previous systematic reviews examining early versus delayed post-operative exercises have favoured delayed exercises due to reported negative effects from early exercise on wound drainage and seroma formation and findings of only marginal benefit from early exercise for shoulder function (<LINK REF="REF-Karki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karki 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shamley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shamley 2005</LINK>). Other authors, however, continue to recommend early exercise post-operatively and suggest that prescription factors such as the type, intensity and method of progression of exercise may be more important than when exercise is started following surgery ( <LINK REF="REF-Bendz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Box-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Box 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>While considerable attention has been paid to issues surrounding the post-operative time period, questions also remain over whether exercise administered at any time in the recovery from breast cancer treatment is beneficial in addressing late onset or persistent upper-limb dysfunction. </P>

<P>2) Grey Literature</P>
<P>We updated searches to August 2008 and, where possible, we examined literature as far back as 1966. We performed an expanded search to identify articles potentially missed through the database searches and in order to identify "grey literature". This included the following:</P>
<P>a. Handsearching of reference lists of all retrieved articles, texts and other reviews on the topic;<BR/>b. Handsearching the journals <I>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</I>, <I>Physical Therapy</I>, <I>Journal of Surgical Oncology</I>;<BR/>c. Pub Med: related articles feature;<BR/>d. Web of Science: citation searching of key authors;<BR/>e. Search of SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe);<BR/>f. We contacted local and foreign experts for further information (Cochrane Breast Cancer review group, key authors of publications included in this review);</P>

<P>Where appropriate we used the following terms in the search:</P>
<P>Terms related to the condition: breast cancer (neoplasm/tumor/tumour), mastectomy, axillary dissection, sentinel node dissection, adhesive capsulitis, cording, axillary web syndrome.<BR/>Terms related to the intervention: physical therapy (physiotherapy), rehabilitation, exercise(s), stretching, mobilization (mobilization), physical activity (exertion).<BR/>Terms related to the outcome: ROM, strength, lymphedema, pain, and quality of life.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:51:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>One author (MMC) performed the initial pre-screen of all the databases to identify potential trials and screened the results to exclude articles that were clearly irrelevant. Two independent authors (MMC and KLC) screened the reduced search results. If either or both authors felt that the article potentially met the inclusion criteria, or if there was inadequate information to make a decision, we retrieved full text copies of the article (and translated them into English, if necessary). Using the defined eligibility criteria, the two authors independently decided on trial inclusion. A priori, authors made the decision to exclude any data that were available only in abstract form. Review authors were not blinded to study authors, journal or study results. Agreement was measured and assessed by using kappa (k) statistics. We compared results at each stage and resolved any disagreements by consensus. Where necessary, we referred any disagreements to a third reviewer (KCO).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>KLC/MO and MMC independently assessed quality . We evaluated each study using a 6-point scale that included allocation concealment and a modified version of the validated Jadad 5-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). We scored each trial for allocation concealment as Yes: Adequate concealment, Unclear: Inadequate information, or No: Clearly inadequate concealment. We used the Jadad scale to assess randomization, double blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts. In these studies, however, double blinding is not possible (i.e. participants know if they are exercising or not). Therefore, we summarized quality using a modification of the Jadad scoring system as follows: 1) Was the study described as randomized (1 = yes; 0 = no)?; 2) Was the outcome assessment described as blinded (1 = yes; 0 = no)?; 3) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1 = yes; 0 = no)?; 4) Was the method of randomization well-described and appropriate (1 = yes; 0 = no)?; 5) Was the method of blinding of the assessment of outcomes well-described and appropriate (1 = yes; 0 = no)?; 6) Deduct 1 point if methods for randomization OR blinding were inappropriate.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>MO/MMC and KLC extracted data independently using a standardized form. MMC and KLC attempted to contact authors (using e-mail, letter and/or fax) to search for additional papers and/or to obtain missing data.</P>
<P>1) Characteristics of the studies<BR/>a. The sponsors of the study and their contributions as well as authors' affiliations.<BR/>b. Methods: design, recruitment, method of randomization, sample size, trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, withdrawals.</P>
<P>2) Characteristics of the study population<BR/>a. Stage breast cancer/ tumour/lymph node status<BR/>b. Radiation/other therapies<BR/>c. Type of surgery<BR/>d. Time from surgery<BR/>e. Age<BR/>f. Weight/Body Mass Index (BMI)</P>
<P>3) Characteristics of the interventions<BR/>a. Type of exercise intervention: ROM, stretching, strength/resistance exercise training<BR/>b. Description/details of exercise intervention: frequency, intensity, type and time<BR/>c. Description/details of usual care/comparison intervention<BR/>d. Adherence/contamination<BR/>e. Co-interventions (e.g. medication use)</P>
<P>4) Characteristics of the outcomes<BR/>a. Self-reported (e.g. pain, functional outcome, QOL)<BR/>b. Clinician performed (e.g. ROM, arm volume, muscular strength)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where data were sufficient, we conducted a meta-analysis. We combined trials using Review Manager (RevMan, Version 5.0). Where continuous data resulted from the same method of measurement (e.g. ROM), we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD). Where continuous data resulted from different scales (e.g. scales used to assess symptoms such as pain), we summarized these as the standardized mean difference (SMD). For dichotomous data, such as the presence or absence of a symptom, we expressed the impact of treatment as the odds ratio (OR) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). All point estimates were reported with their associated 95% confidence intervals. We pooled the results of comparable trials using random-effects estimates, 95% confidence intervals, the Chi<SUP>2</SUP>test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
<P>If data were statistically heterogeneous, we considered the following as possible explanations:</P>
<P>1) Exercise prescription factors: type of exercise/program, supervised versus self-directed exercise, variables of exercise (e.g. frequency, intensity and time)<BR/>2) Timing of intervention<BR/>3) Stage of breast cancer<BR/>4) Type of surgery</P>
<P>We planned subgroup analyses, where possible, for the following:<BR/>1) Type of exercise intervention<BR/>2) Type of surgery (e.g. mastectomy versus breast conserving surgery)<BR/>3) Type of axillary dissection (e.g. complete, level 1 and II, sentinel node)<BR/>4) Age: &lt; 65 years versus 65 years and older<BR/>5) Time period of the study (prior to 1995 versus 1995 and later)</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-10 14:00:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The ability to perform meta-analyses in this review was limited due to the variability in the timing, type and intensity of exercise, the rate of progression of exercise, and the lack of data on compliance/adherence to prescribed regimens. Differences in the chosen outcome measures, measurement methods and in the timing of the measurements precluded pooling of data. Taking into account these limitations, the following is a summary of the main findings of the review:</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:59:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Early versus delayed exercise</HEADING>
<P>Findings of the meta-analyses support the implementation of early exercise to restore shoulder flexion and abduction ROM in early weeks post-operatively; however, there is inconclusive evidence of benefit from early exercise beyond this time point.</P>
<P>A small-to-moderate negative effect of increased wound drainage volume and an increase in wound duration of approximately 1 day were found from early exercise. The clinical significance of these negative effects on wound drainage is unclear and may be offset by the need to attain adequate shoulder ROM in preparation for adjuvant radiation therapy. No statistically significant difference was found between early and delayed exercise in the incidence of seroma formation, delayed wound healing, wound aspirations, pain or lymphedema. These findings, however, should be interpreted with caution as few studies examining early versus delayed exercises were considered of adequate quality.  Moreover, many of the included studies were conducted more than ten years ago. Thus, results may not be generalizable to patients undergoing more recent, potentially less invasive, surgical procedures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exercise versus comparison</HEADING>
<P>Findings of the meta-analyses suggest benefit from more structured post-operative exercise programs compared to usual care (exercise pamphlet or no exercise instruction) for shoulder flexion ROM in both the short and long-term and shoulder abduction ROM in the long-term.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of a negative effect from exercise on post-operative wound drainage volume, or in the reported incidence of seroma formation, pain or lymphedema. The findings in this comparison group, however, are limited by the small number of studies and the statistical and clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Physical therapy versus comparison subgroup</HEADING>
<P>Findings of the meta-analyses provide evidence of benefit from physical therapy intervention on shoulder flexion ROM, shoulder abduction ROM and shoulder function. The findings suggest a statistically and clinically significant benefit from exercise post-intervention and at six-month follow-up.  Positive effects were the result of three studies that introduced physical therapy treatment within the early weeks following surgery.   </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exercise versus comparison during adjuvant cancer treatment</HEADING>
<P>There is some evidence of benefit from exercise programs carried out during adjuvant cancer treatment for shoulder abduction ROM and upper-extremity strength; however, these findings are from single studies. There is no evidence of benefit from exercise for shoulder flexion ROM, pain or quality of life. There is no evidence of increased lymphedema risk from exercise programs carried out during adjuvant cancer treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exercise versus comparison following cancer treatment</HEADING>
<P>Three studies provide evidence of benefit from exercise programs carried out following cancer treatment for quality of life. The significance of this finding is unclear as all studies examined general exercise programs compared to wait-list control. Thus the findings may be due to other exercise benefits or factors such as attention and social interaction. There is evidence of benefit from resistance exercise for upper-extremity strength; however, this finding was from a single study. There is no evidence of a beneficial effect from exercise for shoulder ROM or upper-extremity strength impairment, or from Tai Chi Chuan for upper-extremity strength. Most studies included in this category were exercise-based rather than physiotherapeutic-type interventions and were not addressing upper-limb dysfunction as their primary outcome. Research is needed that specifically addresses persistent or late onset upper-limb dysfunction.</P>

<P>The 24 studies included in this review were of variable quality and only 10 were considered of adequate methodological quality.  In particular, inadequate randomization and allocation concealment, and lack of blinding of outcome measurements may have led to bias in the study findings. Further progress must be made to improve research quality.</P>

<P>The ability to perform meta-analyses in this review was limited by the variability in the timing, type and intensity of exercise, and the rate of progression of exercise. Moreover, differences in the chosen outcome measures, measurement methods and in the timing of the measurements precluded pooling of data. Despite inter-study heterogeneity, we proceeded with the meta-analyses for many outcomes as the intervention effects were largely consistent among studies, although to varying degrees.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity among studies also precluded subgroup analysis to determine the appropriate type of exercise. Furthermore, we were not able to evaluate the influence of participant demographic and treatment factors such as age or type of surgery/node dissection as data were not available. Similarly, the limited number of total studies in each category precluded evaluation of the influence of the time period of the study (1995 or later) for outcomes other than wound drainage.<BR/>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Karki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karki 2001</LINK> examined the effect of physical therapy methods and exercise after breast cancer surgery. The meta-analysis included five prospective clinical trials with 597 participants that examined the effect of early versus delayed shoulder exercise on wound drainage volume. The authors concluded that there was evidence of a negative effect from early exercise (favouring delayed exercise) for wound drainage volume. The results of the present review including seven RCTs with 912 participants also suggest a negative effect on wound drainage from early exercise. However, our estimated negative effect (SMD: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.49) was smaller than that of <LINK REF="REF-Karki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karki 2001</LINK> (SMD: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.50).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Shamley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shamley 2005</LINK> performed a systematic review and meta-analysis also examining early versus delayed exercises. The meta-analysis included six RCTs with 540 participants. The authors did not find a statistically significant difference between early and delayed exercise for wound drainage volume. The authors did find a statistically significant increase in seroma incidence from early exercise (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.61), whereas the present review did not. Differences in our findings compared to the two previous reviews may reflect the addition of newer studies and our more stringent study eligibility criteria.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-10 09:43:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-10 09:43:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Patients and clinicians with a preference for improved shoulder ROM in the short term and limited aversion to increased wound drainage volume and duration may opt for early implementation of post-operative exercise, while those with an aversion to increased wound drainage volume and duration, may prefer to delay implementation of post-operative exercises by approximately one week. There is evidence that patients benefit from exercise interventions that include more structured instruction and/or supervision when compared to exercise instruction via a pamphlet or no exercise instruction. Of note, larger benefits were found for shoulder ROM and shoulder function outcomes from physical therapy treatment that was introduced in the early weeks following surgery. There was no evidence of a negative effect from upper-extremity exercise on the incidence of upper-limb lymphedema at any time point following surgery.  </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-10 09:43:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Methodologically rigorous studies are needed to further explore the required degree of supervision and intensity of post-operative upper-extremity exercise regimens. Studies carried out following surgery should provide detailed information on the exercise prescription and include measurement of shoulder movement (ROM) and function. As well, future studies should monitor adherence to exercise and adverse effects such as seroma formation, wound drainage, lymphedema, and pain. Where appropriate, outcomes should be assessed in both the short and long-term.</P>
<P>There is a clear need for research studies that consider the benefit of exercise relative to patient demographic and treatment variables. In particular, studies are needed that examine the benefit of exercise in older individuals. Further research is also needed that examines the benefit of exercise for late onset and persistent upper-limb dysfunction and for outcomes such as pain and upper-extremity strength.</P>
