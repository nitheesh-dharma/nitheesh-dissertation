<P>The role of corticosteroids in the induction of labour is uncertain.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring labour on artificially. There are many different methods used and one is to give corticosteroids to ripen the cervix and induce labour.

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The role of corticosteroids in the process of labour is not well understood. Animal studies have shown the importance of cortisol secretion by the fetal adrenal gland in initiating labour in sheep. Infusion of glucocorticosteroids into the fetus has also shown to induce premature labour in sheep. Given these studies it has been postulated that corticosteroids will promote the induction of labour in women.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Clinical trials of corticosteroids for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. We assessed trial quality.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one small trial (66 women) was included. The primary outcome vaginal birth within 24 hours was not reported. No benefit of intramuscular administration of corticosteroids with<BR/>intravenous oxytocin was found when compared with oxytocin alone. However, given the small size of this trial this result should be interpreted cautiously.</P>

<P>The effectiveness of corticosteroids for induction of labour is uncertain. This method of induction of labour is not commonly used and so further research in this area is probably unwarranted.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>
<P>The role of corticosteroids in the process of labour is not well understood. Animal studies have shown the importance of cortisol secretion by the fetal adrenal gland in initiating labour in sheep. Infusion of glucocorticosteroids into the fetus has been shown to induce premature labour in sheep (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Mati 1973</LINK>). Some assumptions have been proposed regarding the mode of action of corticosteroids, including both a paracrine and autocrine action, following the identification of glucocorticoid receptors on human amnion (<LINK REF="REF-Kossmann-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kossmann 1982</LINK>). Given these studies it has been postulated that corticosteroids given intra-amniotically will promote the induction of labour in women.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine, from the best available evidence, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour in comparison with other methods of induction of labour.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Clinical trials comparing corticosteroids for cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction (<I>see</I> 'Methods of the review'); the trials included some form of random allocation to either group; and they reported one or more of the prestated outcomes.</P>

<P>Pregnant women due for third trimester induction of labour, carrying a viable fetus.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Clinical trials comparing corticosteroids for cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses will be limited to the primary outcomes: <BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components will be explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score &lt; 7 at 5 minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>'Uterine rupture' includes all clinically significant ruptures of unscarred or scarred uteri. Trivial scar dehiscence noted incidentally at the time of surgery is excluded.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes may appear in individual primary reviews, but will not contribute to the secondary reviews.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (greater than contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability). However, due to varied reporting there is the possibility of subjective bias in interpretation of these outcomes. Also it is not always clear from trials if these outcomes are reported in a mutually exclusive manner.</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<P>A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different groups of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. </P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in these reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from 1 to 26. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from 2 to 26) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) will include only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<P>The reviews will be analysed according to the following clinical subgroups of women:</P>

<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For most reviews, the data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with The Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form, which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous authors in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials, i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels were sought.</P>
<P>We included individual outcome data in the analysis if data met the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. We processed trial data using the methodology described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). We analysed data extracted from the trials on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis was performed wherever possible). If data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the authors of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>We extracted data from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence affect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to the individual authors, who entered them into the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), checked them for accuracy, and analysed them using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and, in the absence of heterogeneity, we pooled results using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>
<P>For this update, the one trial identified was independently assessed by two authors (J Kavanagh and A Kelly).</P>

<P>Three studies were excluded from this review because they were not randomised controlled trials, two were controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Craft-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Craft 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grudev-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grudev 1990</LINK>) and one was a one group pre-test post-test evaluation(<LINK REF="STD-Penev-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Penev 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>One identified study (<LINK REF="STD-Barkai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barkai 1997</LINK>) was excluded because it involved a complex intervention of extra-amniotic dexamethasone or saline in combination with a Foley catheter inflated to 30 ml. This paper will be included in the review on 'other methods used for induction of labour'.</P>
<P>Two studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. One study of 11 women (<LINK REF="STD-Mati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Mati 1973</LINK>) involved an intra-amniotic injection of 20 mg of dexamethasone or a similar volume of saline. It was felt by the authors that this form of intervention for induction of labour would not be performed now and hence results were not presented.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Jenssen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jenssen 1977</LINK>) examined the effect of a course of oral dexamethasone on rates of spontaneous labour compared with no treatment on 120 women. The subsequent method of induction is not specified and no definable prespecified outcomes were reported. Allocation in this study was by alternation.</P>
<P>One study, a randomised controlled trial comparing intramuscular injections of aprophen with prednisolone in 32 women with prolonged pregnancy is awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Grudev-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Grudev 1988</LINK>).

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>One trial, involving 66 women, is included. No benefit of intramuscular administration of corticosteroids with intravenous oxytocin was found when compared with oxytocin alone. The<BR/>primary outcome vaginal birth within 24 hours was not reported. There was a non-significant trend towards fewer caesarean sections in the intervention group, (6% versus 15%, relative risk 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.92). There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation with or without fetal heart rate changes. No babies in either group had an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, nor were there any incidences of maternal fever.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The effectiveness of corticosteroids for induction of labour is uncertain. This method of induction of labour is not commonly used and further research in this area is probably unwarranted.</P>

<P>The effectiveness of corticosteroids for induction of labour is uncertain. Corticosteroids cannot be recommended for induction of labour in clinical practice on the basis of this trial evidence.</P>
<P>[Note: The seven citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given that corticosteroids are not now in common use for induction of labour, the authors consider that further research in this area is probably unwarranted.</P>
