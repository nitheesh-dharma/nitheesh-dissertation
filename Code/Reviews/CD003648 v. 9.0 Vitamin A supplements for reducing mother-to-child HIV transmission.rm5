<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The main aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women, during pregnancy or after delivery, or both, on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection. Cochrane researchers collected and examined all relevant studies to answer this question and included five trials. This is an update of a review last published in 2011.</P>
<P>
<B>What is the key message of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>Giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women, during pregnancy or after delivery, or both, probably makes little or no difference to the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>Five trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. Two trials were from South Africa and one trial each from Malawi, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. The trials compared women receiving vitamin A supplements to women not receiving such supplements. None of the participants received antiretroviral therapy (ART).</P>
<P>The review shows that in women living with HIV infection and not on ART:</P>
<P>- giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women during pregnancy, immediately after delivery, or both, probably has little or no effect on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (<I>low certainty evidence</I>);</P>
<P>- giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight (<I>low certainty evidence</I>) and probably reduces the number of low birthweight babies (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>), but it is uncertain whether the intervention has an effect on the number of preterm births, stillbirths, or deaths among the women (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The intervention has largely been superseded by ART, which is widely available and effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched for studies up to 25 August 2017.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-04 16:14:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Strategies to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks, elective Caesarean section delivery, and avoiding giving children chewed food. In some settings, these interventions may not be practical, feasible, or affordable. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions (that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes) would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low-cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-26 13:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 25 August 2017, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-09-04 16:12:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) as appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and conducted random-effects meta-analyses.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-07 14:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005 and none of the participants received ART. Women allocated to intervention arms received vitamin A supplements at a variety of doses (daily during pregnancy; a single dose immediately after delivery, or daily doses during pregnancy plus a single dose after delivery). Women allocated to comparison arms received identical placebo (6601 women, 4 trials) or no intervention (697 women, 1 trial). Four trials (with 6995 women) had low risk of bias and one trial (with 303 women) had high risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>The trials show that giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women during pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.26; 4428 women, 5 trials, <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; 3883 women, 3 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>). However, giving vitamin A supplements during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight (MD 34.12 g, 95% CI &#8722;12.79 to 81.02; 2181 women, 3 trials, <I>low certainty evidence</I>) and probably reduces the incidence of low birthweight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97; 1819 women, 3 trials, <I>moderate certainty evidence);</I> but we do not know whether vitamin A supplements affect the risk of preterm delivery (1577 women, 2 trials), stillbirth (2335 women, 3 trials), or maternal death (1267 women, 2 trials).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-07 14:21:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antepartum or postpartum vitamin A supplementation, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV in women living with HIV infection and not on antiretroviral drugs.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-10 14:09:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that there were 38.8 million people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide in 2015, half of whom were women of childbearing age (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2016</LINK>). In addition, there are more than 600 new paediatric infections each day worldwide; most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2015</LINK>). Children mostly acquire these infections from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.</P>
<P>The high number of women who are of childbearing age and who are living with HIV makes the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV a global health priority (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2015</LINK>). Current strategies to reduce the risk of transmission include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to HIV-positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine, or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>), elective Caesarean section delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Read-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 2005</LINK>), and avoiding giving children chewed food. Despite their benefits, these interventions are impractical in many resource-limited countries because they require the determination of the HIV status of pregnant women and are costly, complex, and require skilled personnel. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions that could potentially be implemented in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes would be valuable. Vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy is one low-cost intervention that has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-10 14:09:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin A refers to a group of unsaturated organic compounds that include preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids (<LINK REF="REF-Damodaran-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damodaran 2017</LINK>). The vitamin exists as preformed retinol in animal food sources, retinyl esters in fortified foods, and provitamin A carotenoids in plant sources. Both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A are metabolized in cells to retinal and retinoic acid, the active forms of vitamin A, to upkeep the vitamin&#8217;s multiple biological functions (<LINK REF="REF-Thorne_x002d_Lyman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne-Lyman 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The biological functions of vitamin A include the regulation and promotion of growth and differentiation of many cells, and maintenance of the integrity of the epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Vitamin A is necessary for formation of the photosensitive visual pigment in the retina, and reproductive functions (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanumihardjo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanumihardjo 2011</LINK>). In the 1920s the vitamin was considered to be an anti-infective agent (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1928" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1928</LINK>), and there is increasing evidence that it is essential for normal immune function (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semba-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin A deficiency is most prevalent in areas where diets lack preformed vitamin A, such as in South and Southeast Asia, and Sahel and sub-Saharan regions of Africa (<LINK REF="REF-West-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2001</LINK>). It has been estimated that about 19 million pregnant women in low-income countries are affected with vitamin A deficiency each year (<LINK REF="REF-West-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women is associated with night blindness, severe anaemia, wasting, malnutrition, reproductive and infectious morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 1998a</LINK>), and increased risk of mortality one to two years following delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 2000</LINK>). About 10 million women suffer from night blindness during pregnancy as a result of Vitamin A deficiency, and this is associated with a constellation of adverse health and nutritional conditions among mothers and their infants (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christian-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 1998c</LINK>; 
<LINK REF="REF-Christian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-16 12:26:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In areas where poor diet and infection coexist, Vitamin A deficiency can increase the severity of infection, which in turn can reduce intake and accelerate body losses of vitamin A to exacerbate deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency and infection in vulnerable groups (notably young children and pregnant or lactating mothers) represent the most compelling consequences of vitamin A deficiency and underlie its significance as a public health problem around the world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Observational studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown low serum vitamin A levels in HIV-positive women to be associated with significantly increased rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Semba-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1994</LINK>) and infant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Semba-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1995</LINK>). However, three observational studies in the USA provided conflicting results: low serum vitamin A was associated with a higher risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1997</LINK>), but not the other two (<LINK REF="REF-Burger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burns-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 1999</LINK>). These studies used different definitions for vitamin A deficiency: two studies used serum retinol levels of less than 30 mg/dL (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burns-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 1999</LINK>), and the other study used less than 20 mg/dL (<LINK REF="REF-Burger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 1997</LINK>). The studies also had small sample sizes; for example, in <LINK REF="REF-Burger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 1997</LINK>, only 4/95 (4.2%) of women had serum retinol levels of less than 20 mg/dL.</P>
<P>Vitamin A was hypothesized to decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV by acting through several maternal, foetal, child risk factors for transmission, or all three. The proposed risk factors were the clinical, immunological, or viral stage of HIV disease among women; the integrity of the epithelial lining of the placenta, maternal lower genital tract, or breast; the occurrence of prematurity and low birthweight; and the status of the systemic and digestive mucosal immune systems of the foetus and the child (<LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-04 16:21:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though there have been dramatic reductions in the number of new HIV infections among children (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2015</LINK>), the magnitude of the paediatric HIV epidemic in resource-limited countries is still important. The simplicity and low cost of vitamin A supplementation makes the clarification of its role in mother-to-child transmission of HIV of considerable importance. We aimed to combine all high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to date to estimate the effect of vitamin A supplementation on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2011</LINK>).</P>

In this Cochrane Review, we only used data from Ap (intervention) versus Pp (placebo).</P>
<P>In the second trial with a two-by-two factorial design, pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either "vitamin A alone", "vitamin A plus multivitamins", "multivitamins without vitamin A", or "placebo" (<LINK REF="STD-Fawzi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzi 2002</LINK>). Although the trial authors stated that there was no evidence of clinical interaction between vitamin A and multivitamins, our plan was to consider only the "vitamin A alone" arm as the intervention. However, in the multiple publications from this trial, separate data for "vitamin A alone" were only available for low birthweight and maternal deaths. Thus, for the other outcomes we used data as reported by the trial authors, that is, vitamin A (a combination of "vitamin A alone" and<I> "</I>vitamin A plus multivitamins" arms) versus no vitamin A (consisting of "multivitamins without vitamin A" and "placebo" arms).</P>
<P>We conducted random-effects meta-analyses in RevMan 5 because of the diversity of study designs, type of intervention (that is, preformed vitamin A with or without beta-carotene), timing of intervention (that is, antepartum supplementation, postpartum supplementation, or both), dosing of the supplements, and comparison groups (that is, placebo or no intervention) (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also calculated the optimal information size for the outcomes and presented this information in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.

<P>Five randomized trials, which were conducted between 1995 and 2005 and included 7298 HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane Review. The included trials assessed the effects of vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy, immediately after delivery, or both. A synthesis of the results of the trials shows that vitamin A supplementation probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). However, vitamin A supplements may increase the mean birthweight (<I>low certainty evidence</I>) and probably reduce the incidence of low birthweight (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-16 12:21:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By the end of the 20th century, HIV had produced a global epidemic that was far more extensive than was predicted when the infection emerged less than two decades earlier. Antenatal seroprevalence of HIV was more than 10% in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV was about 30% to 45% in the region, and the region was contributing more than 90% of the nearly 2000 new HIV infections in children each day worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-De-Cock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Cock 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this context, it was estimated that even with a 3% reduction in transmission, vitamin A supplementation of HIV-positive women would be a cost-effective method of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Vitamin A supplements are easily provided through existing health services (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2006</LINK>). It was thus necessary to clarify the effect of the vitamin on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Such clarification was judged to be important to decision-makers considering affordable options for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite our comprehensive search, we found only six potentially eligible trials on the topic, of which five trials met our inclusion criteria. Our review shows that vitamin A supplementation of HIV-positive women during pregnancy, after delivery, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</P>
<P>Our data suggest that the association between low serum vitamin A levels and increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV seen in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Semba-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1997</LINK>), could have other explanations. Given the observational design of such studies, residual confounding by advanced HIV infection or other factors may explain the seemingly protective association (<LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In high-income countries, the combination of (1) antiretroviral prophylaxis, (2) elective Caesarean section delivery, and (3) formula feeding in clinical practice, coupled with increased prenatal HIV counselling and testing, has essentially eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV in those settings (<LINK REF="REF-Mofenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mofenson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nav_x00e9_r-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navér 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2015</LINK>). Due to cost and other constraints, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa had difficulties implementing these interventions (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2002</LINK>). However, in the last decade, there have been dramatic improvements. Antiretroviral drugs are now widely available in sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-constrained settings (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin A is teratogenic when consumed at high doses during early pregnancy, but none of the trials included in this review reported information on adverse events. However, the doses of vitamin A used in the trials were within the recommended safe low doses (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-10 20:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the inconsistency of the effect of vitamin A supplementation on mother-to-child of HIV across included trials, we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to moderate. The GRADE Working Group classifies research evidence as being of moderate certainty if the true effect of the intervention is likely to be close to what was found in the research but there is a possibility that it is substantially different (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). Therefore, this review does not completely exclude the possibility of a small beneficial or harmful effect of vitamin A supplementation on the risk of mother-to-child of HIV.</P>
<P>For most of the other outcomes assessed, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), implying that we are uncertain about the true effect of vitamin A supplementation on these outcomes. Our main concerns with the evidence were imprecision (as the CIs ranged from large benefits to clinically important increases in harm) and the possibility of publication bias (because two or more eligible trials did not report the outcomes).</P>

<P>We minimized bias in the process of conducting and reporting the review by adhering to the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ultimate goal of this review was to determine whether vitamin A supplementation of HIV-positive women could be recommended as a public health policy to reduce mother-to-child of HIV. We therefore considered overall mother-to-child of HIV, whether occurring during pregnancy, during delivery, or after birth. As such we pooled data from all studies, subgrouped by the timing of supplementation. We do not think that pooling data from these trials has introduced bias to the review.</P>

In a previous systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Gorgia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorgia 2010</LINK> pooled data from six randomized trials and found little or no effect on infant mortality of giving synthetic vitamin A supplements to seemingly healthy mothers after delivery.</P>
<P>In another review, <LINK REF="REF-Thorne_x002d_Lyman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne-Lyman 2012</LINK> pooled data from 17 trials among women of any HIV status and found little or no effect of antepartum retinol and beta-carotene supplements on infant mortality. As in this Cochrane Review, <LINK REF="REF-Thorne_x002d_Lyman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne-Lyman 2012</LINK> found that antepartum supplementation was protective against low birthweight among HIV-positive women.</P>
<P>Vitamin A is important for embryogenesis; playing a vital role in the development of the foetal heart, embryonal circulatory system, and the regulation of heart asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Zile-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zile 1998</LINK>). This role could explain the substantial reduction in low birthweight in the vitamin A group compared to placebo or no intervention.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-10 20:58:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antepartum or postpartum vitamin A supplementation, or both, probably makes little or no difference to the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The evidence from this Cochrane Review suggests that giving vitamin A supplements to pregnant HIV-positive women may have beneficial effects on birthweight.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-04 16:16:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that the currently available randomized trial data do not exclude the possibility that vitamin A supplementation could have small beneficial or harmful effects on mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there may be need for an appropriately powered randomized trial to assess the additive effect of the intervention in antiretroviral-treated women. However, with the current widespread use and success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, further research on the use of vitamin A supplements for this indication may not be warranted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between 2011 review and this review update</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Authorship</HEADING>
<P>The 2011 review had five authors (Wiysonge CS, Shey MS, Kongnyuy EJ, Sterne JA, and Brocklehurst P), but the current update has four authors (Wiysonge CS, Ndze VN, Kongnyuy EJ, and Shey MS).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>There are no differences between the two versions of the review, as both have an identical primary outcome (HIV infection status of the child).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The 2011 review had 12 secondary outcomes linked to the child (infant death, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis, neonatal admission to neonatal unit, death by 24 months of age, side effects in the child, preterm delivery, very preterm delivery, birth weight, low birth weight, very low birthweight, and long-term side effects in survivors) and five maternal secondary outcomes (maternal death, postpartum infection, side effects in the mother, cost of the intervention, and acceptability of the intervention). The current update has five child-related secondary outcomes (mean birthweight, low birthweight, child death by two years of age, preterm delivery, and stillbirth) and two secondary outcomes linked to the mother (maternal death and postpartum CD4 count).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methods</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2011</LINK>, we used a fixed-effect method as our default method for meta-analysis, and only used a random-effects model when there was substantial statistical heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1). However, due to clinical heterogeneity, we used the random-effects method for all meta-analyses in this review update.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>We included five studies in the 2011 review (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumwenda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumwenda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Friis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 2006</LINK>), and five reviews in the current update (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chikobvu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chikobvu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumwenda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumwenda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 2006</LINK>). We included <LINK REF="STD-Friis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Friis 2004</LINK> in the 2011 review but excluded it from this review update because further assessment revealed that the study did not meet our inclusion criteria. In addition, we included a new study in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Chikobvu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chikobvu 2000</LINK>).</P>
