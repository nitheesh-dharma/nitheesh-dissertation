<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:02:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Different types of hypnotherapy are used to try and help people quit smoking. Some methods try to weaken people's desire to smoke, strengthen their will to quit, or help them concentrate on a 'quit programme'. Trials have used different types and amounts of hypnotherapy and compared them with different control conditions, including no treatment, brief advice, or smoking cessation counselling. Although it is possible that hypnotherapy could be as effective as counselling treatment there is not enough good evidence to be certain of this.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-07-21 16:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register and the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, SCI, SSCI using the terms smoking cessation and hypnotherapy or hypnosis. Date of most recent searches July 2010. There were no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-07-21 16:15:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We considered randomized controlled trials of hypnotherapy which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. They also independently assessed the quality of the included studies.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Those lost to follow up were considered to be smoking. We summarised effects as risk ratios (RR). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-06 15:02:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven studies compared hypnotherapy with 18 different control interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the results of the individual studies, with conflicting results for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy compared to no treatment, or to advice, or psychological treatment. We did not attempt to calculate pooled risk ratios for the overall effect of hypnotherapy. There was no evidence of a greater effect of hypnotherapy when compared to rapid smoking or psychological treatment. Direct comparisons of hypnotherapy with cessation treatments considered to be effective had confidence intervals that were too wide to infer equivalence.</P>

<P>We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six-month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment. There is not enough evidence to show whether hypnotherapy could be as effective as counselling treatment.

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-03 13:53:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-02 15:46:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Hypnotherapy has been recognized as a therapeutic tool by professional medical groups in a number of countries for many years, and can be powerful for changing patterns of behaviour when used as an adjunct to other therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (<LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 1995</LINK>). Clinical research is still limited but some success has been reported for symptom reduction in irritable bowel syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Whorwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whorwell 1991</LINK>), asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1988</LINK>), chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1994</LINK>) and for improving the quality of life of cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1982</LINK>). There is however, little consensus about how hypnotherapy might induce these effects. It is also recognized that treatment success could be influenced by other factors such as the transference relationship between patient and therapist and the hypnotisability of subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale for hypnotherapy as a useful adjunct for smoking cessation is that, by acting on underlying impulses, it may weaken the desire to smoke, strengthen the will to stop or improve the ability to focus on a treatment programme by increasing concentration (<LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1993</LINK>). Many different hypnotherapy techniques have been employed but the most frequently used approaches are variants of the 'one session, three point' method developed by Spiegel. This method attempts to modify patients' perceptions of smoking by using the potential of hypnotherapy to induce deep concentration. During the session the smoker is instructed that a) smoking is a poison, b) the body is entitled to protection from smoke, and c) there are advantages to life as a nonsmoker (<LINK REF="REF-Spiegel-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiegel 1964</LINK>). This approach also includes training in self hypnosis which may be as important as hypnosis by a therapist (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1980</LINK>). Self-hypnosis can be used at will by the patient. Compliance may be higher and costs lower because only one session is required. In uncontrolled studies six-months abstinence rates using this method are reported to vary between 20 and 35%.</P>
<P>Most of the older studies in the scientific literature are either case reports or poor quality uncontrolled trials, which show a great variability in quit rates (4 to 88%) six months after treatment. Interpretation of these studies is complicated by the many different hypnotherapy regimens used and the variation in number and frequency of treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Holroyd-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holroyd 1980</LINK>). The purpose of this review is to assess the efficacy of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation from all the relevant trials purporting to be randomized and controlled.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of hypnotherapy as a treatment for smoking cessation.</P>
<P>We set out to test the following hypotheses: <BR/>a) That hypnotherapy has a therapeutic effect in achieving long-term smoking cessation compared with no intervention.</P>
<P>b) That the magnitude of the effects observed with hypnotherapy is greater than with other intervention strategies.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-06-09 12:16:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The primary outcome was abstinence (continuous, point prevalence or prolonged) from smoking, assessed at follow up at least six months from the start of treatment. Validated abstinence based on biochemical markers, and abstinence based on self report by telephone and postal questionnaires were accepted. We also looked for any adverse events reported in the studies.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-07-21 16:24:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We identified all reports which might describe randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register (most recent search July 2010). Additional search strategies used to identify studies included: searches of MEDLINE (1966-2010 June week 5), EMBASE (1980-2010 week 26), AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine database) (1985-July 2010) and the ISI Science Citation and Social Science Citation Indexes (BIDS 1981-2005, Web of Science 2005-July 2010) using the terms "hypnotherapy" and "smoking cessation", and cross-referencing the bibliographies of identified trials and reviews. The CISCOM database was no longer available for the 2010 update. There were no language or publication date restrictions in the search.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-03 10:07:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Three authors independently checked all of the trials identified against the inclusion criteria by reading through the full text copies. The lists of included studies were then compared and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. For each included trial, three authors independently extracted information on study methodology, randomization method, participant demographics, intervention details, smoking cessation rates after six months or more, follow-up rates and adverse events, using a standardised data extraction form. We also extracted information on sample size calculation and baseline equivalence. The same authors also independently assessed the quality of the trials based on the 'Risk of Bias' table elements using principles set out in the Cochrane Handbook. Six elements were assessed: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, addressing incomplete outcome data, freedom from selective reporting and verification of smoking cessation. For studies published after the year 2005, we attempted to contact the study authors for any missing or unclear information. Data extraction forms and quality assessments were then compared, and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion. Information extracted for each included study are presented in the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' tables, and the quality assessment results for each study are presented in the 'Risk of Bias' tables.</P>
<P>For data analysis, if the results were not based on an ITT analysis but had 'loss to follow up' recorded, we recalculated the results to include all randomized subjects (except those deceased), with those lost to follow up assumed to be continuing smokers. We used the strictest criteria for abstinence, preferring sustained over point prevalence measures. We summarized individual study results as a risk ratio (RR), calculated as: (number of quitters in intervention group/ number randomized to intervention group) / (number of quitters in control group/ number randomized to control group). An RR greater than 1.0 indicates a higher rate of quitting in the treatment group than in the control group.</P>
<P>We grouped studies into comparisons according to the characteristics of the 'control' condition, categorising it as a wait list/no intervention control, a brief intervention or advice on smoking cessation, a psychologically based counselling intervention, or some other intervention. For trials that provided additional identical therapies, for example counselling sessions, in both the treatment and control arms, we expected that the corresponding effects would be balanced in each arm, and included them in comparisons based on the 'control', but in a separate subgroup. So for each comparison the first subgroup was; 'hypnotherapy alone versus comparison alone' and the second subgroup was 'hypnotherapy + other treatments versus comparison + other treatments'. This allowed us to assess whether additional treatments in both arms might alter the relative effect of the hypnotherapy component and contribute to heterogeneity.</P>
<P>For comparisons where more than one eligible trial was identified, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method to estimate a pooled risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>). This is a change from previous review versions that used odds ratios (OR), because ORs can be misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>). We tested for statistical heterogeneity, and where we found it (p value of the chi-square test &lt; 0.05 or I &gt; ~60-70%) we considered whether it might be accounted for by characteristics of the interventions, patient populations or way in which outcomes were assessed or defined. If there were sufficient trials for a particular comparison, we used a funnel plot to assess the potential publication bias.</P>

<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-03 10:10:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>For the present update we identified five controlled trials potentially relevant for inclusion. All trials were identified within the specialised register of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group; additional searches did not identify further studies. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK>) were relevant to include, making a total of eleven included studies compared with nine in the previous version. All included studies were in English.</P>
</SEARCH_RESULTS>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-08-27 15:58:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The eleven included studies had data from approximately 1120 participants. Additional details of the included studies are presented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Five studies were conducted in the USA, four in Canada and one each in the UK and Australia. All of the included studies were parallel RCTs with follow-up length of at least six months. Sample sizes were typically small, and varied from 20 to 286 participants; only <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> included more than 100 people in each arm and only <LINK REF="STD-Lambe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lambe 1986</LINK> reported a proper sample size calculation. The studies typically included participants who smoked 20 to 40 cigarettes per day (CPD), with an average age between 30 to 40 years and with more females than males.</P>
<P>The studies varied greatly in the method of hypnotic induction used, number of hypnotherapy sessions and duration of hypnotic treatments. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>) mentioned the method or described the details of induction used whilst the rest did not describe the technique. The number of hypnotherapy sessions varied from a single session (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>) up to eight sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fee-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fee 1977</LINK> did not report the number of sessions. The total duration of hypnosis used in the studies ranged from 30 minutes to eight hours. Five studies provided hypnotherapy in a group format (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>). Although there was such diversity in the interventions, we were unable to do sensitivity analyses based on hypnotherapy type and intensity because there was also variation in the control conditions so very few studies were directly comparable. Some studies compared hypnotherapy alone against more than one intervention; and some studies compared hypnotherapy plus other therapies against other treatment(s). Of the studies comparing hypnotherapy alone against a single treatment (or control): one study compared hypnotherapy with a no-treatment waiting list comparison group <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>) had waiting list controls but could not be included in this comparison because treatment was offered before the end of the follow-up period. Five studies compared hypnotherapy with an attention placebo/anti-smoking advice group (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lambe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>). Of these, two (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>) used a control group matching the number of sessions and therapist contact whilst in the other three the comparison intervention had a different format. <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK> compared a session of cessation focused hypnotherapy to a hypnotherapy session that emphasised relaxation; both groups also had multiple sessions of counselling. <LINK REF="STD-Fee-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fee 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK> compared hypnotherapy with non-specific psychological treatments. <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> compared a combination of hypnotherapy, provision of nicotine patch and counselling follow-up calls versus a combination of matched duration psychological treatment, nicotine patch and counselling follow-up calls. Two trials compared hypnotherapy with rapid/focused smoking (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK>) and one with a specific drug (fenfluramine), and with a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fee-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fee 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies compared 'hypnotherapy + other therapies' with identical therapies without the hypnotherapy component. Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK> compared a combination of hypnotherapy, self-help materials and supportive calls against self-help materials and supportive calls; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1975</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK> compared hypnotherapy used in conjunction with counselling against counselling alone; and <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1980</LINK> compared hypnotherapy in conjunction with rapid smoking and counselling, against rapid smoking and counselling alone.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-09-03 11:16:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>We assessed the quality of each study report based on seven items: randomized sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; reporting of incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; verification of smoking cessation; and baseline imbalance.</P>
<P>
<B>Sequence generation and concealment: </B>All the included studies mentioned randomization but none reported the method in enough detail to assess whether sequence generation was adequate or whether there was adequate allocation concealment. We contacted the first author of <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> for more information on their randomization method, and their response showed adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding:</B> It wasn't possible to blind providers and participants in most cases, and most studies did not state whether the outcome assessors were blinded to participants allocation. Only <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK>, in response to our query, stated that the assessors were blinded.</P>
<P>
<B>Incomplete outcome data:</B> Most studies reported the number of participants lost to follow-up and the assumptions made about their smoking status in the analyses. Three studies by Pederson and colleagues did not report whether any participants were lost to follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK> did not report the number in each group; we assumed they were equally divided when calculating back from percentages.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective reporting:</B> All studies reported the outcomes described in their methods section.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Verification of cessation:</B> <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> validated self-reported success using saliva cotinine or spousal proxy and <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK> used carbon monoxide or saliva cotinine. Although two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>) measured serum thiocyanate during the intervention, in both cases abstinence at six months was based on self report. The other studies used self report obtained by a personal or telephone interview or by postal questionnaire, or did not state the method of follow up.</P>
<P>
<B>Baseline imbalance:</B> Two studies had baseline imbalance concerns (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lambe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lambe 1986</LINK>). Three studies did not provide sufficient data to assess baseline equivalence between intervention groups. The remaining studies showed a low risk of bias from lack of baseline equivalence.</P>
<P>There were too few trials in each comparison to undertake sensitivity analysis based on study quality.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-09-03 12:06:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>There was variation in intensity and little information on the types of hypnotherapy used in the studies reviewed, and large variation in the nature of the control interventions. Therefore we did not perform meta-analysis for different forms of hypnotherapy, or provide an overall summary estimate of the effectiveness of hypnotherapy. We organized studies under the following comparisons:</P>
<P>1. Hypnotherapy versus no treatment control<BR/>2. Hypnotherapy versus brief attention or advice on smoking cessation<BR/>3. Hypnotherapy versus psychological treatments<BR/>4. Hypnotherapy versus rapid/focused smoking<BR/>5. Hypnotherapy versus drug<BR/>6. Hypnotherapy versus placebo drug<BR/>7. Hypnotherapy + other treatment versus other treatment alone</P>
<P>Studies comparing hypnotherapy plus other treatments versus the treatments alone (where treatments in both arms are identical) were included in subgroups under one of the above comparisons as explained under <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK> above. We used smoking cessation at the longest follow-up for all studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Trials with multiple treatment or control arms contributed to more than one comparison. Forest plots are used to display the data in all comparisons (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>). Comparison 7 showed evidence of heterogeneity of effects, so no pooled estimate is given. Comparisons 1, 5 and 6 each included only one study. We estimated pooled risk ratios for comparisons 2, 3 and 4. No study reported any adverse events.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypnotherapy versus no treatment; Analysis 1.1</HEADING>
<P>One trial with 20 participants in each arm (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>) compared hypnotherapy with a waiting list control. There was a higher 12-month point prevalence cessation rate for hypnotherapy than the no treatment control group in which there were no quitters (RR 19.00; 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88, analysis 1.1.1). We did not include a second trial with a waiting list control (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1975</LINK>) here, because the intervention arm confounded hypnotherapy and counselling.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypnotherapy versus brief attention or advice; Analysis 2.1</HEADING>
<P>This comparison includes six trials with a total of 396 participants, comparing hypnotherapy with a brief attention or advice control; of these, five trials (n = 363) compared hypnotherapy alone versus attention/advice control alone. Pooling these five trials did not detect a difference in smoking cessation rates at six months or greater follow up (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.1, pooled RR 1.37; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.11, I = 37%). The two relatively larger trials (more than 80 smokers; <LINK REF="STD-Lambe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lambe 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>) showed no trend towards success of hypnotherapy compared to the brief attention/advice control group at follow up. Only one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>) showed a significant increase in smoking cessation rate in hypnotherapy group compared to a control consisting of a single discussion session; as with the separate wait list control condition used for this trial in Comparison 1 there were no control group quitters.The other trial of 33 smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK>) compared a single session of group hypnosis for cessation to a single session hypnosis for relaxation during which no suggestions were made about smoking, with both arms also receiving multi session group-based cessation counselling. This showed a benefit of the intervention but with wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.2, RR 4.24; 95% CI 1.07 to 16.70). Although when pooling all six trials the estimate suggests a benefit of hypnotherapy (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.35, I = 49%) care should be taken with interpreting this result, because a funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) shows clear asymmetry of the results of these six trials, indicating potential publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypnotherapy versus psychological treatments; Analysis 3.1</HEADING>
<P>This comparison includes three trials with a total of 492 participants. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fee-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fee 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 1984</LINK>) with 211 smokers compared hypnotherapy alone with psychological treatments alone. When pooled, no significant difference in smoking cessation rates was detected (pooled RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.1). <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> with 141 smokers compared hypnotherapy with psychological treatments, with nicotine patches being provided to all participants (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.2). There was no significant difference in validated cessation at 12 months although the cessation rate was higher in the hypnotherapy group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.58). The overall estimate pooling three trials did not detect evidence of an effect (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.89, I = 0%).</P>

Within these comparisons no trials provided additional treatments in any arms. None of these comparisons showed any significant difference in smoking cessation rates between the hypnotherapy group and the comparison group. Analysis 4.1 included two trials with 54 smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1986</LINK>) with no evidence that hypnotherapy was either more or less effective than rapid smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33) although with some evidence of heterogeneity (I = 65%). There was only one trial in comparisons 5 and 6 (<LINK REF="STD-Fee-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fee 1977</LINK> for both, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.33 and RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.58 respectively).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypnotherapy as an adjunct to other cessation interventions</HEADING>
<P>The last comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) included four trials that compared hypnotherapy in combination with other treatments, against the other treatments alone. The trials have been divided into subgroups depending on the categories of other treatments. There was too much evidence of heterogeneity to pool all studies (I = 75%). <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.1 included a single trial with only 20 smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK>) which compared multisession hypnotherapy plus self help materials and phone calls to materials and calls alone. No one quit smoking in the attention/advice alone group, and the CI was very wide (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.55 to 147.95). <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.2 included two trials with 65 smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1975</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK>); pooling these indicated a benefit of a hypnotherapy session as an adjunct to counselling although the estimate was not very precise (RR 4.80, 95% CI 1.71 to 13.49, I = 40%). <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.3 included a single trial with 44 smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1980</LINK>) that compared hypnotherapy combined with psychological treatments and rapid smoking treatments against a combination of psychological and rapid smoking treatments (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.99), which did not detect any benefit of the addition of the hypnotherapy component.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-03 13:53:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The eleven studies in this review do not demonstrate clear evidence of a greater long-term benefit of hypnotherapy compared to other interventions, or no intervention. Most studies did not detect significant differences in quit rates at six months or longer. Studies were very diverse so could not be combined in a single meta-analysis. Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide any additional evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy. Those studies which did find higher quit rates compared to controls were small, and had methodological weaknesses. Most studies were conducted before the improvements in the standard of study design and reporting for smoking cessation trials seen in the 1990s. Biochemical validation of self-reported quitting was only used in the two most recent studies. If hypnotherapy can increase the likelihood of quitting compared to no intervention or brief advice, it may be due to non-specific factors such as extended contact with a therapist. The absence of a suitable placebo for hypnotherapy to control for the non-specific effects makes evaluation difficult. One trial by Pederson and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1979</LINK>) did include two arms intended to investigate the non-specific elements of hypnotherapy. One arm received a hypnosis session which was presented as an aid to relaxation, and the other controlled for the therapist presence by using a video presentation for the hypnotherapy session. These both had lower quit rates, similar to the counselling alone control.</P>
<P>When hypnosis is compared with other interventions involving therapist contact, group contact or other support, there is no evidence that it is more successful. One problem with these 'head to head' comparisons is that the evidence for the efficacy of some other behavioural interventions is equally difficult to evaluate. A Cochrane review of aversive smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Hajek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajek 2001</LINK>) concluded that methodological problems in the trials made it impossible to show whether the technique was effective.</P>
<P>This update includes two new trials. One of these, with 281 participants, increases the amount of available supportive evidence considerably (<LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK>). In this study both intervention and control groups received nicotine patches, and the hypnotherapy component was compared to behavioural counselling, an effective cessation intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>). Both treatment conditions provided two hours of face-to-face contact and three follow-up phone calls. There were no significant differences between the conditions at any follow-up point but at six and 12 months the quit rate was higher in the hypnosis group. Since the control group received an effective intervention, the absence of a significant differences might be interpreted as evidence of equivalence, although the confidence intervals do not rule out the possibility that hypnotherapy was more, or less, effective than standard counselling. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006</LINK>) was a pilot study, so although the intervention of eight sessions of hypnotherapy and self-help materials had more quitters than self-help alone, numbers were too small to provide clear evidence.</P>
<P>The highly significant treatment effects of hypnotherapy on smoking cessation claimed by past uncontrolled studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dedenroth-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dedenroth 1968</LINK>) cannot be confirmed from analysis of randomized controlled trials. Although many therapists offer hypnotherapy for smoking cessation and it continues to be a popular choice amongst smokers seeking treatment there is recognition that the success rates quoted by practitioners are likely to be exaggerated (<LINK REF="REF-Handel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yager-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yager 2010</LINK>). Encouraging results reported in uncontrolled studies may be due to the motivation of those presenting for treatment, or may not reflect likely long-term success or drop-out rates.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-18 11:12:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend hypnotherapy as a specific treatment for smoking cessation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-18 11:12:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Since hypnotherapy is regularly suggested as a possible aid to smoking cessation there is a need for large trials to establish its efficacy. The type of hypnotherapy used needs to be clearly defined and described. Comparison needs to be made with active interventions, preferably matching for therapist contact time.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The comment asked whether anyone knew of any formal comparisons of hypnotherapy with treatments such as NRT or bupropion</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>We know of no randomized controlled trials comparing hypnotherapy with NRT or bupropion (Zyban) but we eagerly await such reports. We agree that it is important to compare different methods of smoking cessation. At the moment, only nine trials have been identified, and overall these have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six-month quit rates than other interventions or indeed no treatment. The small number of trials and their heterogeneity mean, however, that the jury is still out, and further data from adequately powered randomized studies is urgently needed.</P>

<P>This contribution raises an interesting and important point. The inclusion or otherwise of those lost to follow-up is the concern of intention to treat analysis (ITT) which is comprehensively discussed in Section 8.4 of the Reviewer's handbook (available on the web at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/homepages/106568753/handbook.pdf ).<BR/>The ideal strategy is to compare the groups exactly as randomised, but if data on some participants are lost for a variety of reasons, this can be impossible. ITT analysis aims to include all participants randomized into a trial irrespective of what happened subsequently. ITT analyses are generally preferred as they are unbiased, and also because they address a more pragmatic and clinically relevant question. It is the view of the Collaboration that ITT analysis delivers the most robust evidence and is to be preferred over less conservative approaches, and it explicitly adopts this approach in its reviews wherever possible.<BR/>In the case of smoking cessation, the convention is to treat patients lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. Some people may consider this inappropriate since we may be attributing the continuation of smoking to people who have actually quit. However, first, we are dealing here with randomised trials with a hypnotherapy and a control intervention, and this assumption is made for both the treatment and the control arms of each study, so it is thus unlikely that the use of ITT will adversely affect the treatment arm compared with the control arm. Second, the decision to assume that those lost to follow-up are continuing smokers is based on clinical judgement as to what would be the most likely outcome, and most professionals would agree that this assumption is not unreasonable.<BR/>Ideally, we would compute both ways, i.e. assuming that those lost to follow up were, first, continuing smokers and then, second, quitters, and perform a sensitivity analysis. Another option would be to analyse as you have suggested, using only the available data, i.e. excluding losses to follow up. Of the nine included studies in the current review, four only present an ITT analysis with insufficient information to perform an available-data analysis (the Pederson studies and the Williams trial). None of the remaining five studies achieves a statistically significant result by excluding dropouts and those lost to follow up. The main impact of the analysis is to reduce the precision of the estimates by widening the confidence intervals. We continue to abide by the guidance of the Cochrane Collaboration convention, and present the outcomes on an intention to treat basis where possible, as they are currently displayed in the review.</P>
