<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-25 15:19:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Does a policy of early discharge of stable preterm infants with home support of gavage feeding compared with a policy of discharge of such infants when they have reached full sucking feeds lead to improvement in feeding, growth and other clinical outcomes?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks) are not usually discharged from hospital until they are able to suck all their feeds. Early discharge of babies who are stable but still need gavage (tube) feeds could unite families sooner and might reduce costs. These babies could graduate to full sucking feeds at home with some professional support. However, this practice could present a burden for the family and might increase complications during the transition from tube feeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>Data from one quasi-randomised trial with 88 infants from 75 families were included in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> Infants in the early discharge programme with home gavage feeds had a mean hospital stay that was approximately nine days shorter than that of infants in the control group. Infants in the early discharge programme also had lower risk of clinical infection during the home gavage period compared with infants in the control group during the corresponding time in hospital. No significant differences were observed between groups in duration and extent of breast feeding, weight gain, re-admission within the first 12 months post discharge from the home gavage programme or from hospital, scores reflecting parental satisfaction or health service use.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions: </B>Evidence is needed regarding the effects of early home discharge for preterm babies who are stable but still need gavage (tube) feeds.</P>

<P>We included in the review data from one quasi-randomised trial with 88 infants from 75 families. Infants in the early discharge programme with home gavage feeding had a mean hospital stay that was 9.3 days shorter (mean difference (MD) -9.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.49 to -0.11) than that of infants in the control group. Infants in the early discharge programme also had lower risk of clinical infection during the home gavage period compared with those in the control group spending corresponding time in hospital (risk ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). No significant differences were noted between groups in duration and extent of breast feeding, weight gain, re-admission within the first 12 months post discharge from the home gavage programme or from hospital, scores reflecting parental satisfaction or overall health service use.</P>

<P>Experimental evidence on the benefits and risks for preterm infants of early discharge from hospital with home gavage feeding compared with later discharge upon attainment of full sucking feeds is limited to the results of one small quasi-randomised controlled trial.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-26 20:57:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-25 22:26:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A commonly accepted criterion for discharge of physiologically stable preterm infants is that gavage (tube) feeds are no longer required (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). The last one to two weeks of hospitalisation for stable infants is used primarily for providing gavage feeds during their transition to full sucking feeds, along with education and support for parents.</P>
<P>Reducing length of hospitalisation for preterm infants has been suggested to have positive emotional and psychological benefits for the family (<LINK REF="REF-Laddem-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laddem 1992</LINK>) and for the infant's development (<LINK REF="STD-Casiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Casiro 1993</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials have shown that 'early discharge' of physiologically stable preterm infants based on a set weight criterion is safe and cost-effective (<LINK REF="STD-Lefebvre-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lefebvre 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Casiro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 1997</LINK>). However, to be eligible for inclusion in these studies, infants had to be gaining weight satisfactorily on full sucking feeds.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-26 20:57:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Discharge of physiologically stable preterm infants who still need gavage feeds has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evanochko-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evanochko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meerlo_x002d_Habing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meerlo-Habing 2009</LINK>). This model of care is based on the premise that graduation to full sucking feeds can be undertaken successfully at home with appropriate healthcare support. Potential benefits of this model of care are that uniting the family earlier may have a positive impact on the infant's development, and costs for the health service and for the family may be reduced. Potential disadvantages arise from the increased burden on the family associated with this higher level of care and possible complications associated with gavage feeding, for example, growth failure and aspiration pneumonia.<BR/>
<BR/>All home gavage feeding programmes provide some form of follow-up until gavage feeding is no longer required and weight gain is adequate. The types of healthcare support described include outpatient clinic visits with hospital- and/or parent-initiated telephone calls (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evanochko-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evanochko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>); home visits as considered necessary by the nurse or as requested by the mother (<LINK REF="REF-Meerlo_x002d_Habing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meerlo-Habing 2009</LINK>); healthcare worker-initiated telephone calls; and 24-hour emergency phone contact for parents (<LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meerlo_x002d_Habing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meerlo-Habing 2009</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-25 17:10:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies investigating growth outcomes reported that early discharge with home gavage feeding for stable preterm infants led to adequate weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evanochko-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evanochko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>). Additionally, <LINK REF="REF-Meerlo_x002d_Habing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meerlo-Habing 2009</LINK> showed increased duration of breast feeding, with relative risk of breast feeding cessation before six months reduced for those infants discharged early (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.05). Only one study reported infants requiring re-admission (<LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1997</LINK> reported a reduction in hospital stay of 9.3 days from the birth weight category average, and <LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK> a reduction of 7.4 days. All anecdotal (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evanochko-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evanochko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1997</LINK>) and survey responses from parents (<LINK REF="REF-Sturm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturm 2005</LINK>) regarding home gavage feeding programmes were positive.

<P>We initially planned the search strategy to be centred around gavage tube feeding and early discharge. However, it was necessary to broaden the search to include all trials of early discharge programmes for preterm infants, as gavage feeding may have been included as one component of an early discharge programme.</P>
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.</P>
<P>We undertook literature searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to March 31, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to March 31, 2015) and MEDLINE (1982 to March 31, 2015) databases. We used the free-text terms 'early discharge', 'hospital in the home', 'random$', 'gavage', 'gavage feed$' and 'tube feed$'. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms used included 'patient discharge', 'home care services', 'home nursing', 'length of stay', 'enteral nutrition', 'randomised controlled trials', 'random allocation', 'double-blind method', 'single-blind method' and 'clinical trials'. We did not restrict the search by language. We found no new trials in the updated search.</P>

<P>We identified 12 trials. We excluded seven trials of early discharge programmes because all infants were on full sucking feeds before discharge home (<LINK REF="STD-Bhargava-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bhargava 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lefebvre-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lefebvre 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Casiro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charpak-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Charpak 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finello-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Finello 1998</LINK>). Feeding status on discharge home was not described in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dillard-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dillard 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puerto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Puerto 1993</LINK>). The authors of these trials have confirmed that infants in their study were on full sucking feeds before discharge home (<LINK REF="STD-Dillard-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dillard 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puerto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Puerto 1993</LINK>); therefore we excluded these trials. <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1998</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial of a home-supported early discharge programme. Infants were eligible for the study if birth weight was less than or equal to 1800 grams and gestational age was &lt; 36 weeks at birth. Exclusion criteria included infants with congential abnormalities, severe apnoea, neurological impairment, feeding intolerance, an unwilling or incapable caregiver, an unsafe home environment or lack of access to home care services. Infants in the experimental group were discharged home at approximately 1800 grams if certain clinical criteria were met, one of which was <I>"infant tolerating full feedings, either via gavage or nipple"</I>. Control group participants were discharged home according to routine hospital policy, including the requirement to be on full sucking feeds. The study authors have not reported the proportion of infants who received home gavage feeds; therefore, this study could not be included in the analysis. It may have been possible to include data from this study if the authors had provided separate subgroup analyses for the outcomes of those who were discharged home on gavage feeding; however, these data were not available from study authors.</P>
<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_rtenstrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Örtenstrand 1999</LINK>, most infants in the experimental group (80%) were discharged home while still requiring gavage feeds (n = 36/45). The inclusion criterion for this systematic review was <I>'early discharge home with gavage feeds and healthcare support versus later discharge home when full sucking feeds are attained'</I>. Given the difficulty involved in locating studies specifically designed to assess home gavage feeding, we have decided to include this study, even though 20% (9/45) of the infants in the experimental group did not receive home gavage feeds. The nine infants who did not receive home gavage feeds were discharged to the programme and received home visits. They were discharged from the programme when the ordinary criteria for hospital discharge were met (i.e. clinically well and gaining weight satisfactorily on full sucking feeds). These nine infants were included in the analysis for this systematic review.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, we will refer to the experimental group as the home gavage programme.<BR/>
<BR/>This review, therefore, includes one quasi-randomised controlled clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_rtenstrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Örtenstrand 1999</LINK>) as described in two publications.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>This single-centre Swedish study involved 88 infants from 75 families (45 infants/40 families - experimental, 43 infants/35 families - control). Participants were preterm infants with a mean gestational age at birth of 31.4 weeks (standard deviation (SD) 2.8) in the experimental group and 32 weeks (SD 2.3) in the control group. A total of 70% (23/40) of mothers in the experimental group were primiparous, and 60% (21/35) in the control group. The experimental group included five pairs of twins (10/45; 22%), and the control group included eight pairs (16/43; 37%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>This trial compared early discharge with home visits by a registered nurse for infants still requiring special care (mainly gavage feeds) versus standard care (discharge home when clinically well and gaining weight satisfactorily on full sucking feeds). Most of the infants in the early discharge group were discharged home while still requiring gavage feeds (36/45; 80%). Infants were discharged from the home programme when the ordinary criteria for hospital discharge were met (i.e. clinically well and gaining weight satisfactorily on full sucking feeds).</P>
<P>Study entry occurred when infants met the inclusion criteria listed in the table of included studies. On study entry, infants in the experimental group (allocated to the home programme) had a mean postmenstrual age of 35.9 weeks (SD 1.6) and infants in the control group (who remained in hospital) had a mean postmenstrual age of 35.6 weeks (SD 1.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures and results</HEADING>
<P>The end of the intervention was defined as discharge from the home gavage programme for the experimental group and as discharge from hospital for the control group. No significant differences in postmenstrual age were noted at the end of study intervention (experimental 38.7 weeks, control 38.6 weeks). The trial measured breast feeding outcomes, weight gain, rehospitalisation, infection (clinical signs), health problems, medications, home visits, telephone calls, visits to the neonatal ward, travelling time for the nurse, health service use during the first year post discharge, confidence in handling the baby, experiences related to care, experiences related to infant health and parental anxiety.</P>

The nursery in the trial included two separate rooms with separate teams of nursing staff; the rooms were randomly designated as experimental or control.

<P>Evidence from this single included study shows that early discharge with home support of gavage feeding for stable preterm infants resulted in a reduction in length of hospital stay and a decrease in the proportion of infants with clinically diagnosed infection. The home gavage programme was not associated with any significant effect on duration or extent of breast feeding, weight gain, parental confidence and anxiety or health service use.</P>
<P>The included study made no cost comparisons from trial entry to discharge from home support versus traditional hospital care, but study authors did document the amount of support provided during the home gavage period. This was as follows.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Days on home programme - mean 19.6 (SD 9.2).</LI>
<LI>Visits per family - median 5, range 1 to 19.</LI>
<LI>Nurse time (includes travel and visit) per family - mean 10.4 hours, range 1.8 to 38.9 hours.</LI>
<LI>Telephone calls by nurse - mean 1.1 (SD 1.2) per family.</LI>
<LI>Telephone calls by parents - mean 0.9 (SD 1.8) per family.</LI>
<LI>Scheduled visits to neonatal ward - mean 1.7 (SD 0.9).</LI>
<LI>Unscheduled weekday visits to neonatal ward - mean 0.3 (SD 0.7).</LI>
<LI>Unscheduled weekend visits to neonatal ward - mean 0.1 (SD 0.4).</LI>
</UL>
<P>On face value, it would appear that costs to support an early discharge programme with home support for gavage feeding would be less than costs to support in-patient hospital care, but further work is necessary to adequately document and compare healthcare costs.</P>
<P>Although the single included study suggests that early discharge with home support of gavage feeding for stable preterm infants was a safe, manageable option for infant and family, and may even be beneficial, these results need to be interpreted with caution. The single trial in the review included a relatively small number of infants and was not adequately randomised. This may have resulted in a selection bias that makes it difficult to assess the true benefits and risks associated with the early discharge programme. Nevertheless, the positive findings warrant further examination in high-quality clinical trials with concealed allocation and adequate sample size.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-25 21:56:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Experimental evidence on the benefits and risks of early discharge with home gavage feeding of preterm infants compared with traditional hospital care is limited to the results of one small quasi-randomised controlled trial. Therefore, recommendations for practice cannot be made with confidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-25 21:58:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials are needed that include concealed random allocation, complete follow-up of all randomly assigned infants and adequate sample size to evaluate infection rates, feeding and growth, healthcare costs, impact on family, complications of gavage feeding and long-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants allocated to early discharge with home gavage feeding or traditional hospital care.<BR/>
