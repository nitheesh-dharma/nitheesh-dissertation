<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-09 12:09:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) are naturally occurring hormones that control the production of circulating blood cells by the bone marrow. Some CSFs also release stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream; these could help the brain repair itself after stroke. In experiments of stroke, CSFs show the potential to improve disability caused by a stroke. In this analysis, we assessed the effect of CSFs on outcome after stroke using data from clinical trials of people with recent stroke. We included a total of 11 studies and 1275 participants. A higher death rate was observed in participants treated with erythropoietin (EPO) in three trials (782 participants); whether further trials of EPO will be performed early after stroke remains unclear. In eight small trials involving 548 participants, patterns of improvement after a stroke were observed using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and further trials are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CSFs in the treatment of people with recent stroke.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1985 to September 2012), EMBASE (1985 to September 2012) and Science Citation Index (1985 to September 2012). In an attempt to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we contacted manufacturers and principal investigators of trials (last contacted April 2012). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.</P>

<P>We included a total of 11 studies involving 1275 participants.

EPO significantly increased the red cell count with no effect on platelet or white cell count, or infarct volume. Two small trials of carbamylated EPO have been completed but have yet to be reported. We included eight small trials (n = 548) of G-CSF. G-CSF was associated with a non-significant reduction in early impairment (mean difference (MD) -0.4, 95% CI -1.82 to 1.01, P = 0.58) but had no effect on functional outcome at the end of the trial. G-CSF significantly elevated the white cell count and the CD34+ cell count, but had no effect on infarct volume. Further trials of G-CSF are ongoing.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:19:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is one the commonest causes of disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>), ranked third in all causes of global disability life-years. There are very few effective treatments for acute stroke: aspirin, thrombolysis and hemicraniectomy for ischaemic stroke, and none for haemorrhagic stroke. Colony stimulating factors (e.g. erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor) show promise for therapeutic use in experimental stroke and in early human clinical trials.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-09 11:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Colony stimulating factors (CSFs), also called haemopoietic growth factors, regulate the bone marrow production of circulating red cells, white cells and platelets. CSFs act on stem cells leading to lineage-specific differentiation. Stem cell factor (SCF) regulates the differentiation of CD34+ stem cells whilst other factors modulate the synthesis of more specific cell types: erythropoietin (EPO) for red cells; granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for neutrophils; granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for macrophages and neutrophils; macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, or colony-stimulating factor-1, CSF-1) for monocytes; and thrombopoietin (TPO) for megakaryocyte maturation and platelet synthesis. Evidence now suggests that these factors may be candidate treatments for stroke, either as potential neuroprotectants or as neuroreparative agents (<LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:19:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>SCF is a haemopoietic cytokine produced by bone marrow stromal cells. It has limited clonogenic activity when used alone but augments other CSFs, including G-CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Gabrilove-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabrilove 1994</LINK>). When administered following middle cerebral artery occlusion in pre-clinical studies, SCF induced neuroproliferation and neurogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2002</LINK>), the former by a combination of inducing migration of bone marrow derived cells to the peri-infarct area and stimulating proliferation of intrinsic neural progenitor cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kawada-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawada 2006</LINK>). Alone and in combination with G-CSF, SCF can reduce infarct size and induce functional improvement in rat models of acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2007a</LINK>). Similarly, in experimental chronic stroke (3.5 months post ictus), SCF plus G-CSF treated rats had an improved outcome and a reduced infarct volume when compared with control (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>EPO controls red cell production and has been available in recombinant form since 1985; it has been utilised for the treatment of anaemia in people with end-stage renal disease since 1988. EPO was neuroprotective in experimental stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Brines-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brines 2000</LINK>) and increased functional recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004</LINK>), effects possibly mediated by inhibiting apoptosis in the penumbra (<LINK REF="REF-Siren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siren 2001</LINK>). In a small clinical trial, EPO was safe and well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2002</LINK>) but in the following phase III trial safety concerns were raised (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2009</LINK>). Derivatives of EPO, e.g. carbamylated EPO, which do not alter red cell kinetics but retain their neuroprotective activity, have been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Erbayraktar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erbayraktar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leist-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leist 2004</LINK>); small clinical studies of these have been completed but have yet to be reported.</P>
<P>G-CSF acts on haemopoietic stem (CD34+) cells to regulate neutrophil progenitor proliferation and differentiation. It is used routinely to mobilise stem cells in humans for transplantation into patients with haematological malignancies, or in the patients themselves. Pre-clinical studies have found that G-CSF modulates the regenerative ability of cells in the brain and enhances their capacity to acquire neuronal characteristics. When given to mice following intravenous bone marrow transplantation, G-CSF increased the number of neuronal cells derived from bone marrow precursors (<LINK REF="REF-Corti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corti 2002</LINK>). Administration of G-CSF to mice (<LINK REF="REF-Six-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Six 2003</LINK>) or rats (<LINK REF="REF-Schabitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabitz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shyu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shyu 2004</LINK>) improved survival and reduced cerebral infarct size in experimental studies. Functional recovery was also enhanced, with mice demonstrating improved cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2005b</LINK>), and rats demonstrating improved neurological behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Shyu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shyu 2004</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis observed that these effects occur in transient but not permanent models of cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-England-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2009</LINK>). Neuroprotective effects are thought to relate to an anti-inflammatory action, with up-regulation of transcription protein STAT-3. G-CSF also appeared to reduce apoptosis and enhance neurogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2005a</LINK>). Interestingly, G-CSF deficient mice have larger infarcts, effects that are reversed by G-CSF administration (<LINK REF="REF-Sevimli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sevimli 2009</LINK>). G-CSF induced improvements in functional outcome appeared to be preserved in aged stroke rats (<LINK REF="REF-Popa_x002d_Wagner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popa-Wagner 2010</LINK>) and no deleterious effects were seen with co-administration of thrombolysis in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Kollmar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollmar 2010</LINK>). Although G-CSF increases total leukocyte counts, there was no evidence of neutrophils infiltrating the stroke lesion, important since this might lead to microvessel occlusion and the release of free radicals and interleukins (<LINK REF="REF-Schabitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabitz 2003</LINK>). G-CSF improved sensorimotor recovery in a rat model of cerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2005</LINK>) and in vitro can protect human cerebral neurons from ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Jung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jung 2006</LINK>). G-CSF is a candidate treatment for stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2005b</LINK>) and has been assessed in phase II and III clinical trials.</P>
<P>GM-CSF can be used to mobilise stem cells (CD34+) and activate macrophages, and has been shown to induce vascular proliferation. GM-CSF improved collateral flow in people with coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Seiler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiler 2001</LINK>). In people with stroke, baseline GM-CSF levels have been seen to be higher when compared with control, but no correlation has been found with clinical or neurological outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro_x002d_Sobrino-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro-Sobrino 2009</LINK>). Pre-clinical studies have found that GM-CSF stimulates arteriogenesis, improves cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Buschmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buschmann 2003</LINK>) and protects against haemodynamic injury in a rat model of cerebral artery occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Schneeloch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneeloch 2004</LINK>). Intra-carotid injection of GM-CSF increased numbers of activated microglial cells and protected against neuronal apoptosis after transient middle cerebral artery ischaemia in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2006</LINK>); GM-CSF, given intravenously, crosses the blood-brain barrier and counteracts programmed cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Schabitz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabitz 2008</LINK>); intra-peritoneal administration decreases infarct volume and improves locomotor recovery in rats with ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Kong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>M-CSF (CSF-1) selectively stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of monocytes, as well as granulocytes and platelets, indirectly through the generation of interleukin-6 and G-CSF. M-CSF has also been reported to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. Serum levels of M-CSF were elevated in people with previous cerebral infarction compared with healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-Suehiro-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suehiro 1999</LINK>). In vitro, M-CSF is neuroprotective, inhibiting excitotoxic neuronal apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2002</LINK>). In mice, recombinant M-CSF increased neuronal survival and reduced the size of the cerebral infarct (<LINK REF="REF-Berezovskaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berezovskaya 1996</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-24 16:28:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although there are several types of bone marrow-modulating colony stimulating factors (CSFs), only erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been studied in completed trials in people with acute or subacute stroke. Most studies were small, studying safety, except for one phase III trial of EPO (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2009</LINK>) and a phase II/III trial of G-CSF (<LINK REF="STD-AXIS_x002d_2-2012" TYPE="STUDY">AXIS-2 2012</LINK>). EPO did not show a significant effect on combined death and dependency but there was an increase in death rate. The trial authors suggest that mortality was related to the abnormally high number of recruits receiving thrombolysis (63%), of which half demonstrated contraindications to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administration. Although no particular mechanism of death was apparent, an EPO/rt-PA interaction could not be ruled out. Additionally, the significant rise in red cell count caused by EPO might be a contributing factor.</P>
<P>Non-haematopoietic derivatives of EPO, which do not increase red cell count and haematocrit (and a subsequent procoagulant state), are in clinical development: two trials of carbamylated EPO have been completed and their results are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-CEPO-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CEPO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CEPO-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CEPO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>G-CSF did not significantly alter functional outcome or death, although its administration was associated with a non-significant reduction in early impairment. G-CSF was well tolerated in all eight trials and appeared to be safe, although it significantly increased white cell count.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:20:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>It is apparent that at least two paradigms are being studied with CSFs in the treatment of stroke. First, CSFs such as EPO and G-CSF are neuroprotective in animal models of acute stroke and this potential mechanism has been investigated in people with acute stroke (<LINK REF="STD-AXIS_x002d_1-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AXIS-1 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AXIS_x002d_2-2012" TYPE="STUDY">AXIS-2 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2009</LINK>). Second, stem cell mobilising CSFs (e.g. SCF, G-CSF and GM-CSF) could contribute to brain repair through neurogenic-related mechanisms, again as has been seen in experimental models of stroke: six trials have investigated this approach (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shyu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shyu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STEMS_x002d_1-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STEMS-1 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STEMS_x002d_2-2012" TYPE="STUDY">STEMS-2 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STEMTHER-2011" TYPE="STUDY">STEMTHER 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>). All of these studies focus on recent stroke. <LINK REF="STD-Floel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Floel 2011</LINK> was a trial of G-CSF in chronic stroke (n = 41) reporting safe and feasible administration.

It is feasible, however, that we did not identify small trials published in less well-known journals. Further bias is introduced from clinical heterogeneity that exists between the studies (e.g. drug dose, timing of outcome measures). This was accounted for, in part, by use of a random-effects model.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:20:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The completed trials provide evidence for the practicality and feasibility of administering CSFs. However, questions have arisen regarding the safety of erythropoietin (EPO) in the context of acute stroke, especially in people who have received thrombolysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrenreich-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenreich 2009</LINK>). The mechanism explaining an EPO/rt-PA interaction is unclear: an increase in blood brain barrier permeability may contribute (<LINK REF="REF-Zechariah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zechariah 2010</LINK>) but further experimental work in stroke models is required. Further clinical studies using EPO in stroke should be avoided at least until safety aspects are explored further experimentally. Whether this applies to non-haematopoietic derivatives of EPO (e.g. carbamylated EPO) is unclear, and results of <LINK REF="STD-CEPO-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CEPO 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CEPO-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CEPO 2009</LINK> are awaited.</P>
<P>The mechanisms by which CSFs might work in acute or subacute stroke are unclear. Although CSFs could be neuroprotective, reductions in stroke lesion size were not seen in trials of EPO or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This may reflect the difficulties in translating experimental stroke models into clinical medicine with animal models not being sufficiently representative of human stroke (<LINK REF="REF-STAIR-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">STAIR 1999</LINK>). G-CSF may also be neuroreparative since its administration in the sub-acute period was associated with a non-significant reduction in early impairment. Similar results have been seen in preclinical studies and mobilised stem cells could enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis. One clinical trial of G-CSF attempted to track the migration of CD34+ cells into the brain (<LINK REF="STD-STEMS_x002d_2-2012" TYPE="STUDY">STEMS-2 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further studies need to address mechanisms by which CSFs might work, for example, using alternative cell labelling techniques or cerebral perfusion imaging. Understanding potential mechanisms of action will help investigators decide when to administer treatment relative to stroke onset. Whether CSFs aid recovery in chronic stroke also needs to be addressed, as is being done in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-STEMS_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">STEMS-3</LINK>).</P>

<P>In Forest Plot 1.1, for the Shyu study, the figures are 0/7 and 3/3.  It is not clear from the review exactly which outcome this relates to in the Shyu 2006 paper (Shyu WC et al. Canadian Medical Association Journal 2006;174:927&#8211;33).  However, if the information comes from Table 2 of the Shyu paper, then it looks as if the numbers should be 1/7 and 3/3.</P>
<P>This potential error will not change the conclusions, but as it involved the primary outcome of the review, I thought I should make you aware of it.</P>
