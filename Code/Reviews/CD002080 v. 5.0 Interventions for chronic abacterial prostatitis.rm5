<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Little evidence that antibiotics or alpha-blocker drugs help to relieve chronic abacterial prostatitis, but heat treatments might be effective and more research is needed.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic abacterial prostatitis (CAP) involves inflammation of the prostate gland and commonly affects men of all ages. It can cause problems urinating, including discomfort and pain, increased frequency and urge, or problems emptying the bladder. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Treatments for CAP include heat treatments (using microwaves) and several different types of drugs. The review found that there is little evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic or alpha-blocking drugs for CAP. Heat treatments in comparison may be useful. However, the few studies that have been performed are generally of poor quality. More studies are needed. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-30 10:49:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), the Cochrane Library, bibliographies of identified articles and reviews, and contact with an expert.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were eligible if they: (1) are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) (2) involve men with chronic abacterial prostatitis (3) control group receives placebo, sham intervention, active pharmacologic or device therapy for chronic abacterial prostatitis and (4) outcomes data are provided. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-30 10:55:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study information on patients, interventions, and outcomes was extracted independently by two reviewers. The main outcome was the efficacy of treatment for chronic abacterial prostatitis versus control in improving urologic symptom scale scores or global report of urinary tract symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the prostate examination, uroflowmetry, urodynamics, analysis of urine, expressed prostatic secretions and seminal fluid, and prostate ultrasonography.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-30 10:56:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 15 treatment trials involved: medications used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 4 trials); anti-inflammatory medications (n = 2 trials); antibiotics (n = 1 trial); thermotherapy (n = 5 trials); and miscellaneous medications (n = 3 trials). The disparity between studies did not permit quantitative analysis. There were a total of 600 enrollees (age range 38 to 45). All but one of the trials were done outside the United States.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The treatment trials are few, weak methodologically, and involve small sample sizes. The routine use of antibiotics and alpha blockers for chronic abacterial prostatitis is not supported by the existing evidence. The small studies examining thermal therapy appear to demonstrate benefit of clinical significance and merit further evaluation. Additional treatment trials are required and they should report important patient characteristics (e.g., race), study design details and utilize clinically relevant and validated assessment measures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-30 10:59:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic abacterial prostatitis is a common but enigmatic condition (<LINK REF="REF-Pfau-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfau 1986</LINK>) that has been termed "a wastebasket of clinical ignorance" (<LINK REF="REF-Stamey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamey 1980</LINK>). The hallmark of chronic prostatitis is its symptom complex of pelvic area pain and lower urinary tract symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krieger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krieger 1996</LINK>). There were almost 2 million outpatient visits per year in the United States from 1990-94 with a diagnosis of prostatitis (<LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton Collins 1998</LINK>). Prostatitis affects men of all ages, unlike BPH and prostate cancer which are predominantly diseases of older men. There are several types of prostatitis, each with different characteristics and proposed treatments. The umbrella term, prostatitis, is frequently used to cover all these conditions. The etiology of prostatitis is unknown in over 90% of cases; the remaining 5-10% of cases are bacterial (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Rosette-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Rosette 1993a</LINK>). Previous literature describes potential determinants of prostatitis, including: sex hormone levels, diet, past genitourinary disease, stress, psychological factors, allergy, and marital status (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>). More recent studies have examined age (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton Collins 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1998</LINK>), race (<LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton Collins 1998</LINK>), infectious agents (including viral and sexually transmitted diseases) (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dominique-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dominique 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowentritt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowentritt 1995</LINK>), uric acid (<LINK REF="REF-Persson-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persson 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Persson-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persson 1996b</LINK>), sexual activity (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drabick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drabick 1997</LINK>), autoimmunity (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 1998</LINK>), prostatic cysts and calculi (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Rosette-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Rosette 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thin 1997</LINK>), proinflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1998</LINK>), and prostate biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Aus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aus 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional classification of prostatitis by Drach (<LINK REF="REF-Drach-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drach 1978</LINK>) is popular, although the validity has never been tested. In addition, this etiologic-based classification system may contribute to the confusion (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 1998a</LINK>). A newly established (also not validated) NIH chronic prostatitis classification system (<LINK REF="REF-Krieger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krieger 1999</LINK>), based closely on the traditional classification, incorporates the terminology "chronic pelvic pain syndrome" to reflect the uncertainty about whether the categories of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia are, in fact, related to the prostate gland. The NIH definition of Type III chronic abacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CAP/CPPS) is defined as "no demonstrable infection," broken down further to reflect inflammatory ("white cells in semen, expressed prostatic secretions or post-prostatic massage urine") and non-inflammatory ("no white cells in semen, expressed prostatic secretions or post-prostatic massage urine") components. The scope of treatments recommended for chronic abacterial prostatitis is a testament to how little is known about what causes the condition, and how to diagnose and treat it. Since the symptom complexes of chronic abacterial prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia overlap, investigators have hypothesized that benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments (i.e., finasteride and alpha blockers) may help some men with chronic abacterial prostatitis. Other treatment options have ranged from antibiotics to thermotherapy. As a result, chronic abacterial prostatitis often causes physician frustration (<LINK REF="REF-Meares-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meares 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nickel-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 1998b</LINK>), patient confusion and dissatisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Keltikangas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keltikangas 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meares-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meares 1973</LINK>), variable thresholds for referral (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Rosette-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Rosette 1993b</LINK>), and potentially inappropriate antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton Collins 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Randomized or controlled clinical trials for abacterial prostatitis were identified through MEDLINE from 1966 to March 1999 by crossing an optimally sensitive search strategy for trials developed for the Cochrane Collaboration with the MeSH headings (including all subheadings) prostatitis, chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, chronic abacterial prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and prostatodynia (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>). The Cochrane Library, reference lists of identified trials, and previous reviews were also searched for additional trials. An expert in prostatitis (J. Curtis Nickel, MD) was asked to identify additional trials. There was no language restrictions.</P>

<P>Eligibility:<BR/>At least two reviewers (MMC, RM) independently decided on eligibility.</P>
<P>Extraction:<BR/>Data extraction, including study characteristics, was performed independently by two reviewers. Extracted data was reviewed by the principal reviewer and discrepancies resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality:<BR/>As a measure of overall methodologic study quality we assessed the quality of concealment of treatment allocation according to a scale developed by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) assigning 1 to poorest quality and 3 to best quality: 1 = trials in which concealment was inadequate (e.g. such as alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth); 2 = trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the other categories; and 3 = trials deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation (e.g. central randomization; numbered or coded bottles or containers; drugs prepared by the pharmacy; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes etc. that contained elements convincing of concealment). Additionally, we assessed whether study participants and investigators were blinded to the treatment provided.</P>
<P>Outcomes:<BR/>Symptomatic changes measured by urologic symptom scale scores (AUA, Boyarsky, Prostatitis Symptom Severity Index), global assessment, pain scores, quality of life score, or subjective rating; uroflowmetry (peak or mean urine flow rate ml/sec); prostate examination (volume); analysis of urine (leukocyte or erythrocyte counts, urate concentrations); analysis of expressed prostatic secretions and seminal fluid (leukocyte counts, urate and xanthine concentrations); prostate ultrasonography (volume); and analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA - serum volume). The number and percent of men reporting specific side effects and/or withdrawing from the study were recorded.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis:<BR/>For the clinical trials meeting criteria, there were a range of differences in the interventions, study duration, assessment measures, and clinical outcomes. The disparity between studies and reported outcomes did not permit quantitative analysis or pooling of findings across trials.</P>

<P>Medications Used to Treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>:<BR/>Finasteride, a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, has been investigated as a treatment option to reduce symptoms associated with inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Leskinen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leskinen 1999</LINK>).

There was no statistically significant difference in pain between the two groups. Three men on finasteride experienced partial impotence.

Duzendorfer (<LINK REF="STD-Dunzendorfer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dunzendorfer 1983</LINK>), investigating the use of diphenoxybenzamine, found statistically significant improvements in several pain outcomes at 6 weeks follow up. Although the treated group had orthostatic complaints, the number of patients with this side effect and the duration or severity were not described. In another study involving alpha blockers, 37 patients were enrolled in a double blind, cross-over trial of phenoxybenzamine, baclofen, and placebo; treatments were given in random order and were each given for one month. Phenoxybenzamine resulted in symptomatic improvement in 50% of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Osborn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anti-inflammatory medications:<BR/>Muraro (<LINK REF="STD-Muraro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Muraro 1995</LINK>) examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with Seaprose S (a proteolytic enzyme reported to have anti-inflammatory action) in combination with local prostatic hyperthermia versus monotherapy with hyperthermia in 20 men with chronic abacterial prostatitis. No adverse effects were encountered. The study found that spontaneous pain and pain on palpation were reduced more in the combination treated group compared to the hyperthermia alone group. Wedren (<LINK REF="STD-Wedren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wedren 1987</LINK>) examined the efficacy of Elmiron, an anti-inflammatory agent which has been used in the treatment of interstitial cystitis. Although the treated group (N=15) was noted to have improvement in symptoms, the only symptoms that improved were physician rated non-specific myalgias and arthralgias. One-third of men in the Elmiron group dropped out of the study.</P>
<P>Antibiotics:<BR/>Although antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of chronic abacterial prostatitis, only one small randomized controlled trial has addressed the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for use in men with this condition (<LINK REF="STD-Simmons-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 1985</LINK>). The investigators found no difference in symptom improvement between the antibiotic (minocycline) and the control (Valium) groups.</P>
<P>Thermotherapy:<BR/>Five studies have evaluated different types of heat treatment (either transrectal microwave hyperthermia (TRMH) or transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT)) for chronic abacterial prostatitis; three of the studies used sham treatments. In a study by Vassily (<LINK REF="STD-Vassily-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vassily 1999</LINK>) greater symptom improvement was noted in the TRMH treated group (N = 80), compared with the sham treated group (N = 20). In another trial versus sham in 30 men with both inflammatory and noninflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome, treatment success, defined as a greater than 50% improvement in symptoms, was documented in 55% of men in the heat treated group at 3 months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1993</LINK>). No complications were reported. Montorsi (<LINK REF="STD-Montorsi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Montorsi 1993</LINK>) evaluated different treatment schedules of TRMH in men with both inflammatory and noninflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome in which subjects were randomized to one of three therapeutic heat regimens that differed from each other in total dose of heat delivered and in the time interval between each session. Significant symptom improvement was found in all patients at long term follow-up (26 months), as well as quality of life improvement in 50% of men. Strohmaier (<LINK REF="STD-Strohmaier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Strohmaier 1988</LINK>) randomized subjects to one of two therapeutic heat regimens that differed from each other in total dose of heat delivered. While objective parameters such as uroflow, residual volume, and urinalysis were not effected by TRMH, marked symptom improvement was noted at six months.</P>
<P>The safety and efficacy of TUMT was investigated in 20 men (<LINK REF="STD-Nickel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Nickel 1996a</LINK>). The strengths of the study included the use of validated prostatitis symptom indices, a validated benign prostatic hyperplasia symptom score (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1992</LINK>) and a quality of life question. Heat-treated patients had significantly improved symptom scores compared with sham-treated patients at the 3 month follow up. However, 20% of patients exhibited an array of temporary side effects, including hematuria, impotence, premature ejaculation, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>Miscellaneous medications:<BR/>Persson (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 1996</LINK>) theorized that back flow of urine into prostatic ducts causes prostatic inflammation by increasing concentrations of metabolites containing purine and pyramidine bases and, subsequently, conducted a double-blind controlled study of allopurinol treatment in 54 men with 330 days of follow up. Although this small trial showed improvements in patient-reported symptoms, investigator-graded prostate pain, and biochemical parameters, the data provided, the measures used, and the statistics presented, do not make these findings conclusive that changes in urine and prostatic secretion composition regarding purine and pyrimidine bases relieves symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-Collins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton Collins 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Okada (<LINK REF="STD-Okada-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Okada 1985</LINK>) examined the use of an amino acid preparation, PPC, in comparison with a control group who was treated with a pollen extract. Fifty-one percent of the PPC treated group (N = 32) compared with 37% of the pollen treated group (N = 30) noted "moderate to excellent" symptom improvement. The statistical significance of this finding was not reported. The authors report no severe side effects, but do not elaborate on other side effects that may have been demonstrated.</P>
<P>Quercetin is a naturally occurring bioflavonoid with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In a placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shoskes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shoskes 1999</LINK>), Quercetin was investigated as a treatment in 30 men with NIH category III prostatitis syndromes (chronic abacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia). Symptom improvement, measured by the NIH chronic prostatitis symptom score, was significant in the Quercetin group (mean score improved from 21.0 to 13.0, 35%) but not in the placebo group (mean score improved from 20.2 to 18.8, 7.2%). With Quercetin, one subject reported a headache and one subject reported mild tingling of the extremities, both resolving after cessation of therapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-30 12:17:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review has summarized a diverse range of randomized and controlled trials of treatment options for chronic abacterial prostatitis. The results of the review revealed that the trials are few and weak methodologically with small sample sizes. The heterogeneity of the treatments examined precluded a formal meta-analysis and a quantitative estimate of efficacy.</P>
<P>Several studies had methodologic flaws. For the study conducted by Shah (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1993</LINK>) (reported as an abstract), the symptom assessment instrument was not described. While a validated prostatitis symptom index was used (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 1996b</LINK>) in the study by Vassily (<LINK REF="STD-Vassily-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vassily 1999</LINK>) (also reported as an abstract), the authors reported the index was "modified", raising concern about the validity of the modified version. The symptom index used in the Montorsi study (<LINK REF="STD-Montorsi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Montorsi 1993</LINK>) was an unvalidated modification of a BPH symptom index, the Boyarsky index. The duration of follow up was not reported for one study and whether the pain instrument used was validated is unclear [<LINK REF="STD-Muraro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Muraro 1995</LINK>].</P>
<P>Simmons used a control group that was treated with diazepam rather than placebo and there is no evidence that diazepam is superior to placebo in chronic abacterial prostatitis. The Okada (1985) study utilized a pollen extract as the control. Since there is no evidence that pollen extract is effective in the treatment of chronic abacterial prostatitis, this control group is unsatisfactory. Symptom improvement was measured, although it is unclear whether a validated instrument was used.</P>
<P>Although experts may recommend or support an empiric course of antibiotics for chronic abacterial prostatitis (Nickel 1998a, Lipsky 1999, Bjerklund Johansen 1998), this practice is not supported by the existing evidence regarding disease etiology and treatment outcomes and deserves further scrutiny. Additionally, while a recent review has categorized alpha blocker treatment as "likely to be beneficial" in chronic abacterial prostatitis (Stern 1999), the routine use of alpha blockers was not supported by the available evidence.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The routine use of antibiotics and alpha blockers for chronic abacterial prostatitis are not supported by existing evidence and deserve further scrutiny. The small studies examining thermal therapy appear to demonstrate benefit of clinical significance and merit further evaluation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future methodologically robust randomized controlled treatment trials with larger sample sizes are needed. Future trials should report important patient characteristics (e.g., race), study design details and utilize clinically relevant and validated assessment measures.</P>
