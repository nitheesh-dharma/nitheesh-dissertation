<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 09:53:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Babies who are born before 37 weeks, and particularly those born before 34 weeks, are at greater risk of having problems at birth and complications in infancy. Infants who are born preterm are at greater risk of dying in their first year of life, and of those infants who survive, there is an increased risk of repeated admission to hospital and adverse outcomes including cerebral palsy and long-term disability. Progesterone is a hormone that reduces contractions of the uterus and has an important role in maintaining pregnancy and is suggested for the prevention of preterm labour. Maternal side-effects from progesterone therapy include headache, breast tenderness, nausea, cough and local irritation if administered intramuscularly. At present, there is little information available regarding the optimal dose of progesterone, mode of administration, gestation to commence therapy, or duration of therapy.</P>
<P>The review of 36 randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 8523 women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth, and 12,515 infants, found that where progesterone was given (by injection into the muscle in some studies and as a pessary into the vagina in others), it had beneficial effects, including reducing the risk of the baby dying after birth, suffering complications such as requiring assisted ventilation, necrotising enterocolitis or requiring admission to neonatal intensive care, prolonging the pregnancy, and reducing the chance of neonatal intensive care admission.</P>
<P>Information related to longer-term infant and childhood outcomes was limited. Overall, the trials included in this review were considered to be of good to fair quality. Further trials are required to assess the optimal timing, mode of administration and dose of administration of progesterone therapy.  </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-19 10:54:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation is a common problem in obstetric care, with estimates ranging from 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>). In Australia, approximately 8% of all infants were born preterm in 2000, with 2.7% of these births occurring prior to 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2003</LINK>). Figures are similar for the United States, with a preterm birth rate of 12.0% (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>). While less than 2% of these infants were born prior to 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>), they are at increased risk of complications in infancy, and contribute in excess of 50% of the overall perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2003</LINK>). Infants who are born preterm are at greater risk of dying in their first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>), and of those infants who survive, there is an increased risk of repeated admission to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 1999</LINK>) and adverse outcomes including cerebral palsy and long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1992</LINK>), creating a significant burden upon the community (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 'cause' of preterm labour is multifactorial in origin, and it is important to consider the role of any identifiable risk factors in a woman's pregnancy.</P>
<P>The most significant and consistently identified risk factor for preterm birth, is a woman's history of previous preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakketeig-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakketeig 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berkowitz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkowitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bloom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaminski-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaminski 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kistka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kistka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papiernik-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papiernik 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrini 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>). Estimates suggest the rate of recurrent preterm birth in this group of women to be 22.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Petrini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrini 2005</LINK>), a 2.5 times increased risk ratio when compared with women with no previous spontaneous preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Mercer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 1999</LINK>). For women with a history of a single preterm birth, the recurrence risk in a subsequent pregnancy is approximately 15%, increasing to 32% where there have been two previous preterm births (<LINK REF="REF-Carr_x002d_Hill-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr-Hill 1985</LINK>). Information derived from population-based cohort data suggests that for women who give birth between 20 and 31 weeks' gestation in one pregnancy, 29.3% will give birth prior to 37 weeks in a subsequent pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>). For approximately 10% of these women, the preterm birth will occur at a similar gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kistka-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kistka 2007</LINK>). In up to 50% of cases of preterm birth, the cause is spontaneous onset of labour or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (<LINK REF="REF-Hewitt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattison-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other characteristics in a woman's current pregnancy may place her at increased risk of preterm birth, including women with a short cervix identified by ultrasound assessment, the presence of fetal fibronectin in the vaginal secretions, and presentation with symptoms or signs of threatened preterm labour.</P>
<P>The identification of a short cervix (considered to be less than 2.5cm) on ultrasound examination has been associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth before 34 weeks&#8217; gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>). Identification of fetal fibronectin present in cervico-vaginal secretions has also been proposed as a means of identifying women at risk of preterm birth. Overall, the value of fetal fibronectin in women presenting with symptoms of threatened preterm labour, is a negative test, where women are unlikely to proceed to preterm birth before 34 weeks&#8217; gestation or within seven days of testing (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth though the mechanisms may be different to those operating in women with a singleton pregnancy. Up to 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2003</LINK>). The preterm birth risk of early birth before 37 weeks for women with a singleton pregnancy is 6.3% compared with 97% for women with a triplet pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Progesterone may be administered in various forms and by various routes. These different formulations and modes of administration will have different absorption patterns and potentially have differing bio effects. Whilst no teratogenic effects have been described with most progesterones, there is little in the way of long-term safety data. Maternal side-effects from progesterone therapy include headache, breast tenderness, nausea, cough and local irritation if administered intramuscularly. At present, there is little information available regarding the optimal dose of progesterone, mode of administration, gestation to commence therapy, or duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review was modified in 2006, from the original protocol published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2004, in order to clarify the scope of the review. The title and objectives changed, and the description of participants expanded to include the reason the women were considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth. The primary outcome measure of preterm birth less than 32 weeks' gestation has been changed to preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation to be consistent with World Health Organization definitions of preterm birth. Secondary outcome measures reflecting childhood developmental assessment have been added, reflecting the need for ongoing evaluation of children participating in randomised trials.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-06 11:05:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth and its consequences for women and their babies is a significant health problem in pregnancy and childbirth. While the suppression or prevention of preterm labour should lead to improved survival through a lower incidence of premature delivery, there are theoretical reasons why a fetus may not survive without disability. It is possible that an intrauterine mechanism that would trigger preterm labour could also cause neurological injury to the fetus and that progesterone may prevent labour but not fetal injury. The purpose of this review is to assess the benefits and harms of progesterone administration for the prevention of preterm birth for both women and their infants, when considering the risk factors present for preterm birth.</P>

<P>The analysis in this review involves multiple pregnancies, therefore, wherever possible, analyses should be adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>). Treating babies from multiple pregnancies as if they are independent, when they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies, will overestimate the sample size and give confidence intervals that are too narrow. Each woman can be considered a cluster in multiple pregnancy, with the number of individuals in the cluster being equal to the number of fetuses in her pregnancy. Analysis using cluster trial methods allows calculation of relative risk and adjustment of confidence intervals. Usually this will mean that the confidence intervals get wider. Although this may make little difference to the conclusion of a trial, it avoids misleading results in those trials where the difference may be substantial.</P>
<P>We planned to adjust for clustering in the analyses, wherever possible, and to use the inverse variance method for adjusted analyses, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1983</LINK> involved 168 women from the United States of America who were considered to be at risk of preterm birth due to active military service. Women received 1000 mg of progesterone weekly or placebo, from 16 to 20 weeks' gestation, up until 36 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome for the study related to the incidence of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moghtadaei-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moghtadaei 2008</LINK> involved 260 women from Iran, in a single centre trial, who were considered to be at risk of preterm birth due to advanced maternal age (greater than 35 years). Women received weekly injections of 17P (250 mg) starting at 16 to 20 weeks' gestation until 34 weeks or matching placebo. The main outcomes for the study included delivery before 37, 35 or 32 weeks' gestation, hypertension, diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction or side effects at the injection site. Data from this study could not be included in a meta-analysis because the number of women randomised to each group was not reported in the brief abstract report of the study.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Aboulghar-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Aboulghar 2012</LINK> recruited 313 women from Egypt who were considered to be at high risk of preterm birth because all the pregnancies were conceived by IVF or ICSI. Women received vaginal progesterone 200 mg twice daily from randomisation until delivery or 37 weeks&#8217; gestation or matching placebo. The primary outcomes included preterm birth of singleton and twin pregnancies before 37 completed weeks and before 34 completed weeks. This study contains a mix of singleton pregnancies (n = 215) and twin pregnancies (n = 91) and presented some outcome data separately, as well as for the whole group.  The results for this study have been analysed separately for the two risk groups: multiple pregnancies and women at risk for 'other' reasons. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses to account for multiple pregnancies</HEADING>
<P>For multiple pregnancies we had planned to analyse neonatal data as 'clusters' to account for dependency between twins and triplets. We anticipated that the degree of dependence between twins would vary at the outcome level i.e. in the case of preterm birth the dependency (ICC) is likely to be high, whereas in some outcomes, such as perinatal death or morbidity, the ICC may be much lower. However, there were insufficient data presented in the trial reports to allow us to carry out necessary adjustment for cluster design effect ourselves and, although in several trials results had already been adjusted, we were not able to present these data in our data and analyses tables because they were not reported in a consistent way.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome perinatal death, we therefore carried out a sensitivity analysis assuming two extremes. In the first we assumed complete dependence between infants in multiple pregnancies, i.e. we assumed outcomes were the same for all infants within that pregnancy; in this case the effective sample size for twin pregnancies would be the total number of women rather than infants, and for infant outcomes all event rates and sample sizes were therefore divided by two. In the second sensitivity analyses we assumed very limited dependence (1%) and in this case event rates and sample sizes were divided by 1.01. Results from sensitivity analyses were very similar to those from the unadjusted analyses although the effect estimates changed slightly due to rounding up of event rates and sample sizes, and the 95% CIs were generally slightly wider. Adjusted analyses showed that for women administered progesterone during pregnancy, for the primary outcome perinatal death, there were no statistically significant differences identified when compared with placebo.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Progesterone for women with a past history of spontaneous preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>For women with a past history of spontaneous preterm birth, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of the primary outcomes, perinatal death and in the risk of preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation. The reduction in risk of perinatal death is confined to the subgroup of women receiving intramuscular progesterone. There was significant heterogeneity identified for the outcomes preterm birth before 34 and 37 weeks&#8217; gestation, with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, raising questions about potential bias and therefore caution in interpretation. For the secondary infant and maternal outcomes, the use of progesterone was associated with a reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g, use of assisted ventilation, necrotising enterocolitis, neonatal death, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation and a significant increase in prolongation in pregnancy prolongation. There were no significant differences identified for other secondary infant and maternal health outcomes with the use of progesterone. Information related to childhood health and well being is limited, with only two trials reporting two-year follow-up results to date (<LINK REF="REF-Northen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2007</LINK>), in which there were no documented differences in growth or developmental outcomes between those infants exposed in utero to progesterone and those to placebo. There was no differential effect on outcomes in terms of time of commencing therapy and dose of progesterone from the available evidence.</P>
<P>Further information is required about the optimal route of administration of progesterone, with the largest study to date using vaginal progesterone gel suggesting no benefit in this group of women (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Progesterone for women with a short cervix identified on ultrasound</HEADING>
<P>In the trials to date assessing the role of progesterone in women with a short cervix identified on ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Fonseca-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fonseca 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grobman-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Grobman 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hassan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2012</LINK>), there were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcome perinatal death. Women administered progesterone were significantly less likely to have preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation. For the secondary infant outcomes, the use of progesterone was associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth at less than 28 weeks' gestation. There was also a significant increase in the risk urticaria in women receiving progesterone. Further information is required about the risk of other infant health outcomes, and maternal health outcomes in this group of women. Reporting of childhood outcomes is lacking, with no trials reporting this information to date. The relative efficacy of progesterone compared with cerclage for women with a short cervix remains uncertain, as does the use of progesterone as an adjunct therapy following cerclage placement (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Progesterone for women with a multiple pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The role of progesterone in women with a multiple pregnancy is less clear, with no identified differences in the primary outcomes perinatal death, and preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation. There were also no differences identified for the other secondary infant and maternal health outcomes. Information relating to long-term childhood health outcomes is unavailable to date. There are several ongoing randomised trials assessing the role of intramuscular (<LINK REF="STD-Nassar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nassar 2007</LINK>) and vaginal (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2007</LINK>) progesterone in women with a multiple pregnancy which will contribute information about the role of progesterone in this group of women.</P>
<P>For multiple pregnancies, we had planned to analyse neonatal data as 'clusters' to account for dependency between twins and triplets. We anticipated that the degree of dependence between twins would vary at the outcome level i.e. in the case of preterm birth the dependency (ICC) is likely to be high, whereas in some outcomes such as perinatal death or morbidity, the ICC may be much lower. However, there were insufficient data presented in the trial reports to allow us to carry out necessary adjustment for cluster design effect ourselves and, although in several trials results had already been adjusted, we were not able to present these data in our data and analyses tables because they were not reported in a consistent way. In future updates, we will contact trial authors for additional information to allow us to carry out necessary adjustments in the analysis of the neonatal data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Progesterone for women following presentation with threatened preterm labour</HEADING>
<P>The role of progesterone for women following presentation with threatened preterm labour remains uncertain. The identified randomised trials indicate a reduction in only the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g. However, the outcomes have been reported in only five small trials (332 women), with only four contributing data to meta-analysis (211 women) and are underpowered to detect differences in both maternal and infant health outcomes. There is an ongoing randomised trial assessing the role of vaginal progesterone in women presenting with symptoms or signs of threatened preterm labour which will contribute information about the role of progesterone in this group of women (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Progesterone versus placebo for women with 'other' risk factors for preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>The role of progesterone in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth for 'other reasons' is uncertain, with the three randomised trials that contributed data to the meta-analysis to date indicating no benefit in terms of perinatal death or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation. However, the combined sample size of these trials is significantly underpowered to detect all but large differences in these outcomes.</P>
<P>There is evidence that progesterone for women with a history of previous preterm birth is associated with a reduction in preterm birth before 34 and 37 weeks gestation. As indicated earlier, there was considerable heterogeneity identified, in addition to evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, raising concern about potential bias. The observed reduction in perinatal mortality appears confined to the use of intramuscular progesterone.</P>
<P>However, information relating to longer-term infant and childhood outcomes is currently insufficient, with only two randomised trials reporting to date. Ongoing follow-up of children exposed to progesterone in utero remains a priority. Maternal outcomes following antenatal progesterone therapy were poorly reported in the available literature, including treatment side-effects, preferences of mode of administration and satisfaction of care. Further information is required on these important issues (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2003</LINK>). In addition, there remains uncertainty as to the optimal dose of progesterone to be administered, the optimal route of administration, and the optimal gestational age at which to commence therapy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have issued a committee opinion relating to the use of progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth, indicating the need for further information about the optimal mode of administration (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2003</LINK>), including studies directly comparing the relative efficacy of vaginal and intramuscular preparations.</P>

<P>The use of progesterone in this group of women was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g. However, for all other outcomes, the role of progesterone in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth for 'other reasons' is uncertain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-24 07:46:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to assess the optimal timing, mode of administration and dose of administration of progesterone when given to women considered to be at increased risk of early birth, by virtue of previous history of spontaneous preterm birth, short cervix identified by transvaginal ultrasound, following arrest of symptoms or signs of threatened preterm labour, or on the basis of 'other' risk factors. Assessment of longer-term infant and childhood outcomes remains a priority.</P>
<P>There are several randomised trials that are currently addressing the use of progesterone for preterm birth which will contribute data in the future - <I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> for details.</P>

<P>In view of the increase in the number of trials published, along with the huge variation in the patient populations recruited, we have decided to categorise the studies by the reason women were considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth. We have also included longer-term childhood health outcomes, in recognition of the need for ongoing follow-up of children exposed antenatally to progesterone (Update 2008), and maternal quality of life (Update 2013).</P>

<P>This review examines prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth. Women considered in this review includes women considered at high risk because of multiple pregnancy as well as women with singleton pregnancies considered at high risk for various clinical reasons (history of preterm birth, short cervix, threatened preterm labour and other risk factors). This review included 36 trials with several trials recruiting only women with multiple pregnancies. The results of this review may be easier to interpret and more clinically relevant if the results for women with multiple and singleton pregnancy are assessed and reported separately. </P>
<P>Consequently, this review will no longer be updated in it's current form but will be split into two separate reviews: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy</LI>
<LI>Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy</LI>
</UL>
<P>Each of these reviews will be prepared following publication of a new protocol.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-17 18:06:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review and extracted the data. Any differences were resolved by discussion with all co-authors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The methodology used to assess risk of bias of studies included in the previous version of this review is given in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this update, the following methods were used.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g., random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non random process, e.g.,, odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g., telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Studies will be judged at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. Blinding will be assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate;</LI>
<LI>inadequate:</LI>
<LI>unclear;</LI>
</UL>
<P>where 'adequate' is less than 20% losses to follow-up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data management and analysis</HEADING>
<P>We conducted data management and analysis using RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). V Flenady, R Cincotta and J Dodd independently extracted data. Results are reported as mean differences for continuous variables, and risk ratios for categorical outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We conducted the meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model, and assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the outcomes tables and by using two statistics (H and I<SUP>2</SUP> test) of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). Where we discovered statistical heterogeneity, this was explored.</P>
<P>Results are presented by reason women were considered to be at risk of preterm birth, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>past history of spontaneous preterm birth (including preterm premature rupture of membranes);</LI>
<LI>multiple pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>ultrasound identified short cervical length;</LI>
<LI>fetal fibronectin testing;</LI>
<LI>presentation with symptoms or signs of threatened preterm labour;</LI>
<LI>other reason for risk of preterm birth.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses included an assessment of the effect of: (1) time of treatment commencing (before 20 weeks' gestation versus after 20 weeks' gestation); (2) route of administration (intramuscular, intravaginal, oral, intravenous); and (3) different dosage regimens (divided arbitrarily into a cumulative dose of less than 500 mg per week and a dose of greater than or equal to 500 mg per week). To evaluate the effect of subgroup comparisons, we considered confidence intervals (where non-overlap was taken to indicate a statistically significant difference).</P>
