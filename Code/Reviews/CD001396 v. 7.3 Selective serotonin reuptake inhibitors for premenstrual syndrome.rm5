<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-13 19:23:29 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cause of physical, psychological and social problems in women of reproductive age. PMS is distinguished from 'normal' premenstrual symptoms by the degree of distress and disruption it causes. Symptoms occur during the period leading up to the menstrual period and are relieved by the onset of menstruation. Common symptoms include irritability, depression, anxiety and lethargy. A clinical diagnosis of PMS requires that the symptoms are confirmed by prospective recording (that is recorded as they occur) for at least two menstrual cycles and that they cause substantial distress or impairment to daily life. It is estimated that approximately one in five women of reproductive age are affected. PMS can severely disrupt a woman's daily life and some women seek medical treatment. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treating PMS. They examined the research up to February 2013.</P>
<P>The review included 31 randomised controlled trials which compared SSRIs with placebo in a total of 4372 women who were clinically diagnosed with PMS. SSRIs were found to be effective for reducing the overall symptoms of PMS and also for reducing specific types of symptoms (psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). SSRIs were usually taken for about two weeks before the start of the menstrual period (the luteal phase) or every day (continuously). Both regimens appeared to be equally effective, although more research is needed to confirm this.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were more common in the women taking SSRIs than in those taking placebo. The most commonly occurring side effects were nausea and decreased energy. The review authors calculated that nausea is likely to occur as a drug side effect in approximately one out of seven women with PMS taking a moderate dose of SSRIs, and lack of energy is likely to occur as a drug side effect in approximately one out of every nine women.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low to moderate, the main weakness being poor reporting of methods in the included studies. At least 21 of the studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies.</P>

<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cause of physical, psychological and social problems in women of reproductive age. The key characteristic of PMS is the timing of symptoms, which occur only during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as first line therapy for PMS. SSRIs can be taken either in the luteal phase or else continuously (every day). SSRIs are generally considered to be effective for reducing premenstrual symptoms but they can cause adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-20 13:45:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (February 2013).

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-05 15:00:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were considered in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LPDD) were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-13 19:05:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data on premenstrual symptoms and adverse effects. Studies were pooled using random-effects models. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for premenstrual symptom scores, using separate analyses for different types of continuous data (that is end scores and change scores). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Analyses were stratified by type of drug administration (luteal or continuous) and by drug dose (low, medium, or high). We calculated the number of women who would need to be taking a moderate dose of SSRI in order to cause one additional adverse event (number needed to harm: NNH). The overall quality of the evidence for the main findings was assessed using the GRADE working group methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-13 19:13:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-one RCTs were included in the review. They compared fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram versus placebo. SSRIs reduced overall self-rated symptoms significantly more effectively than placebo. The effect size was moderate when studies reporting end scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84, nine studies, 1276 women; moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%), low quality evidence). The effect size was small when studies reporting change scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.51, four studies, 657 women; low heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=29%), moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>SSRIs were effective for symptom relief whether taken only in the luteal phase or continuously, with no clear evidence of a difference in effectiveness between these modes of administration. However, few studies directly compared luteal and continuous regimens and more evidence is needed on this question.</P>
<P>Withdrawals due to adverse effects were significantly more likely to occur in the SSRI group (moderate dose: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.53, 15 studies, 2447 women; no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), moderate quality evidence). The most common side effects associated with a moderate dose of SSRIs were nausea (NNH = 7), asthenia or decreased energy (NNH = 9), somnolence (NNH = 13), fatigue (NNH = 14), decreased libido (NNH = 14) and sweating (NNH = 14). In secondary analyses, SSRIs were effective for treating specific types of symptoms (that is psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). Adverse effects were dose-related.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate, the main weakness in the included studies being poor reporting of methods. Heterogeneity was low or absent for most outcomes, though (as noted above) there was moderate heterogeneity for one of the primary analyses.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-13 20:42:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most women of reproductive age experience premenstrual symptoms that are associated with the rise and fall of ovarian sex steroids precipitated by ovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2008</LINK>). Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is distinguished from 'normal' premenstrual symptoms by the degree of distress it causes or its detrimental effect on daily functioning, or both (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>). The physiology of PMS is complex and the disorder is poorly understood (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2012</LINK>). It may be associated with the actions of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid, which are neurotransmitters influenced by the menstrual cycle. Abnormal function or deficiency of these neurotransmitters may cause increased sensitivity to progesterone, precipitating PMS symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Definitions of PMS vary, and a wide range of psychological and physical symptoms has been reported. The key characteristic of PMS is the timing of symptoms, which occur only during all or part of the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle). Symptoms disappear by the end of menstruation and do not recur before ovulation, giving a symptom-free interval of at least one week. PMS is cyclical, and occurs in most menstrual cycles (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>). Psychological symptoms can include irritability, depression, anxiety, mood swings, a flat mood (anhedonia) and lethargy. Physical symptoms may include breast tenderness, weight gain, bloating, muscle or joint pain, headache and swelling of the extremities (hands and feet). A clinical diagnosis requires that symptoms are confirmed by prospective recording for at least two menstrual cycles and that they cause substantial distress or impairment to daily life (for example activities at home, work or school, social activities, hobbies, interpersonal relationships) (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epperson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epperson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>). As collecting multiple, daily data points is a laborious process, most diagnoses of PMS are made based on a woman's own perception of her problem. Hence it is suggested that up to 50% of women with reported PMS do not meet the clinical criteria for the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Plouffe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plouffe 1993</LINK>). PMS in this review is defined as symptoms meeting the clinical criteria described above.</P>
<P>A severe form of PMS is known as premenstrual dysphoria or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and was previously also known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>). PMDD is characterised by severe symptoms occurring for a week before each menstrual period and remitting in the week after menstruation, over a period of at least a year. According to American Psychiatric Association (APA) criteria, in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 4 (DSM IV), at least five of the following symptoms must occur for most of the week prior to menstruation: depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability (at least one of these four), decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, appetite changes, sleep disturbance, feeling overwhelmed, and physical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Symptoms should remit within a few days of menstruation. This definition has been questioned because it focuses on severe psychological symptoms while placing relatively little importance on physical symptoms, and may exclude some women with debilitating symptoms that do not meet these specific criteria (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>DSM criteria are currently being updated to include PMDD as a new diagnostic category rather than (as previously) a mood disorder needing further research. Although the proposed DSM V criteria for PMDD are similar to those of DSM IV, they differ in the following respects (<LINK REF="REF-Epperson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epperson 2012</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>symptoms must occur during the final week before menstruation, but do not need to be present most of the time;</LI>
<LI>symptoms are not required to remit within a few days of menstruation, but should improve and should be minimal (if not absent) in the week following menstruation;</LI>
<LI>mood lability and irritability are the leading two symptoms;</LI>
<LI>symptoms cause clinically significant distress or interference with activities at work or school or at home, or both (previously there was no mention of clinically significant distress or of activities at home);</LI>
<LI>PMDD symptoms are not due to an ongoing medical disorder or substance-induced condition.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is a wide variation in estimates of the prevalence of PMS, but it is estimated that 15% to 20% of women of reproductive age have PMS with significantly impaired functioning, and a further 3% to 8% have PMDD. Thus approximately one in five women of reproductive age are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Pearlstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearlstein 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is currently no haematological or biochemical test for PMS, and studies have not shown consistent differences in cyclical hormone levels. In the absence of any objective parameter to measure or diagnose PMD, clinicians and researchers rely largely on validated scales in which a woman self-rates her symptoms. The most widely used self-rating tool is the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), which is a prospective scale that focuses largely on psychological rather than physical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-17 15:18:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drugs that are believed to inhibit the absorption of serotonin, a naturally occurring chemical which acts as a messenger between brain cells (a neurotransmitter). Changing the balance of serotonin appears to improve neurotransmission and enhance mood.</P>
<P>SSRIs are most commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders, and appear to take four to eight weeks to reach clinical efficacy in these disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1999</LINK>). However, it has been shown that SSRIs may become effective for PMS in a matter of days, and usually within four weeks from the start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 1995</LINK>). This may be due to the cyclical nature of PMS and may reflect SSRI action at a different receptor site to that involved in affective disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Sundblad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sundblad 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rapid efficacy of SSRI treatment in PMS permits the use of intermittent dosing regimens. For treatment of PMS a relatively small dose of SSRI is generally used. Administration can be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>continuous, SSRI is taken every day throughout the menstrual cycle;</LI>
<LI>luteal or intermittent, SSRI is taken only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (i.e. from estimated ovulation to menstruation). The SSRI is started about 14 days prior to expected menstruation, based on a woman's usual cycle length;</LI>
<LI>semi-intermittent, taken every day, with a low SSRI dose during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and a higher dose in the luteal phase;</LI>
<LI>as required, SSRI is started at the onset of PMS symptoms and continued until the onset of menstruation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is suggested that avoidance of continuous use may reduce the risk of side effects of SSRIs, which can include anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, sedation, gastrointestinal disturbance, headache, loss of libido and anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearlstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearlstein 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>SSRIs are licensed for treating PMMD in the United States, but not in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other interventions used for premenstrual symptoms include lifestyle modification (for example exercise, smoking cessation, weight management), herbal remedies (for example vitex agnus castus), calcium, vitamin C, hormones, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, danazol and (rarely and as a last resort) hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>). Uncertainty about the pathogenesis of PMS has led to many other treatments being suggested as possible therapies. It has been suggested that, as there is a substantial placebo response, a large number of uncontrolled trials have resulted in a proliferation of claims for ineffective therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Magos-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magos 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different PMS symptoms may have separate causes and therefore require different treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2011</LINK>). It is suggested that most women with severe PMS require either hormonal medication (estrogen with or without progestin) or a psychotropic medication (such as an SSRI) for symptom relief (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>). As the disorder is usually chronic, and may require treatment for 20 years or more, the long-term effects of an intervention are important (<LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the interventions are the subject of other Cochrane reviews, either published or in preparation (as of April 2013), as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Oral contraceptives containing drosperinone</LI>
</UL>
<P>This review found that drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 &#956;g may be beneficial for PMDD.

<P>Serotonin levels appear to vary during the menstrual cycle under the influence of estrogen and progesterone (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>). SSRIs may increase the amount of serotonin available for neurotransmission.</P>
<P>It has been noted that treatments that enhance the action of serotonin improve premenstrual irritability and low mood with a rapid onset of action, which suggests a different mechanism of action than in the treatment of depression. Neurosteroids such as progesterone metabolites may be responsible for the rapid action of SSRIs in this context (<LINK REF="REF-Pearlstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearlstein 2002</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-13 20:51:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the debilitating symptoms and economic cost of PMS, and the likelihood that it will persist long-term, it is important to confirm and quantify the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for treating this disorder. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002.</P>

<P>For the 2013 update of this review, JM conducted an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search and retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (JM and KMW) independently examined these full text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion. We corresponded with study investigators, as required, to clarify study eligibility. Disagreements as to study eligibility were resolved by discussion or by a third review author.</P>

<P>For the original version of this review (2002), all publications identified in the search strategy were assessed by two authors (PWD and KMW) working in parallel. Selection of the trials for inclusion was performed by PWD and KW. Any disagreements were assessed by a third review author and other uncertainties regarding inclusion were resolved by contacting the primary study authors. For the 2008 update of the review, an additional 22 studies were identified by JB and JM, who independently checked the potentially eligible studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-13 23:25:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2008 and 2013 updates, two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This assesses: allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors; and completeness of outcome data.</P>
<P>For the 2013 update, new studies were also assessed for risk of selective reporting bias, which refers to the selective reporting of some outcomes (for example positive outcomes) and the failure to report others (for example adverse events), and for other potential sources of bias.</P>
<P>Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table. Differences in study quality were incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-05-13 23:28:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For continuous data (for example symptom scores), as similar outcomes were reported on different scales, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) between the end scores or change scores for the control and intervention groups of each study. End scores were extracted in preference to change scores, where available, as they may be preferable for outcomes which are unstable or difficult to measure precisely (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For dichotomous data (for example withdrawal rates), we used the numbers of events in the two groups to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes. We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they were presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>
<P>Where there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the rate of adverse events, we calculated numbers needed to harm (NNH) for the moderate dose (that is an estimate of the number of women who would need to receive treatment using a moderate dose in order for one additional harm to occur).</P>
<P>Standard mean differences were interpreted using the following rule of thumb: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1. Total symptoms: end scores</HEADING>
<P>When effects were assessed with end scores, SSRIs reduced overall symptoms significantly more effectively than placebo, with a moderate effect size. This applied to low dose SSRIs (SMD - 0.67, 95% CI -0.29 to -1.05, two studies, 301 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), moderate dose SSRIs (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84, nine studies, 1276 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and high dose SSRIs (SMD -0.95, 95% CI - 0.58 to -1.31, one study, 134 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity for both pooled analyses.</P>
<P>The analyses were stratified by type of intervention (luteal or continuous). The effects of the intervention were non-significantly higher in the studies of continuous SSRIs, but there may have been too few studies in each group to show a significant difference.</P>
<P>Five of the studies in this analysis used sertraline. When analysis was restricted to these studies, there was a significant benefit for the SSRI group with a smaller effect size and no heterogeneity (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.60, five studies, 780 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Functional symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Five studies reported functional symptom scores, reported either as end scores (two studies) or as change scores (three studies).</P>
<P>When functional symptoms were assessed with end scores, no significant difference was found between SSRIs and placebo for low dose SSRIs (SMD -0.34, 95% CI 0.05 to -0.74, one study, 100 women; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.4 Irritability</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies reported irritability scores, reported either as end scores (seven studies) or as change scores (one study).</P>
<P>When irritability was assessed with end scores, SSRIs reduced symptoms significantly more than placebo, with a moderate effect size. This applied to both low dose SSRIs (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.57, one study, 53 women; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>) and moderate dose SSRIs (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.72, five studies, 655 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>). Heterogeneity was absent.</P>
<P>Similarly, when irritability was assessed with change scores, SSRIs reduced symptoms significantly more than placebo. Low dose SSRIs were associated with a small effect size (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.70, one study, 169 women; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>) and moderate dose SSRIs were associated with a moderate effect size (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.80, one study, 169 women; <LINK REF="CMP-012.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effectiveness of SSRIs</HEADING>
<P>The findings of this review indicate that SSRIs are effective for reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This applies both to overall symptoms and also to specific types of symptom (that is psychological, physical, functional symptoms and irritability). Most of the data related to a moderate dose of SSRIs, taken either in the luteal phase only or continuously. Findings were fairly consistent regardless of the dose and timing of the SSRIs. Effect sizes were small or moderate for most outcomes. All the SSRIs tested appeared effective.</P>
<P>There was consistent evidence that even low doses of SSRIs were effective, although moderate doses generally were associated with a larger effect size and a higher response rate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>A wide range of side effects were reported in women taking SSRIs. When numbers needed to harm (NNH) were calculated (that is the number of women who would need to take a drug in order for one women to be likely to experience an event over and above her underlying risk), the most common side effects associated with a moderate dose of SSRI were nausea (NNH = 7), asthenia (NNH = 9), somnolence (NNH = 13), fatigue (NNH = 14), decreased libido (NNH = 14) and sweating (NNH = 14).</P>
<P>For most of these adverse events there was a clear dose-response trend, with an increased risk of adverse events in women receiving a higher dose of SSRI. Adverse events were very common in the only study that used a high dose of SSRI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effectiveness and adverse events associated with different types of administration</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>Only three of the included studies compared different types of SSRI administration, and they included only 269 participants. No significant difference in effectiveness was found between luteal and continuous administration for most outcomes, though there was substantial heterogeneity for the analysis of response rates (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 50%).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that intermittent SSRI administration may be as effective as continuous administration with respect to symptoms such as irritability and mood swings, but may be less effective for somatic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 2008</LINK>). Our analysis of end scores for physical symptoms (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) provides some indirect support for this suggestion. However, direct comparisons between administration regimes are required and currently there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. This is an area that could be further explored.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Only one study compared the rates of individual adverse effects associated with different types of administration, and the difference between luteal and continuous administration was significant only for decreased libido (favouring luteal administration). It seems likely that the risk of adverse effects will be minimised by use of the lowest effective dose and an intermittent dosing regimen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Overall findings</HEADING>
<P>Overall, these findings support the use of SSRIs as an effective and reasonably tolerable first line treatment for PMS.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-22 14:11:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included 31 studies and the findings were generally consistent with regard to both efficacy and safety outcomes. There was very little direct evidence about the relative effectiveness and tolerability of luteal versus continuous drug regimens.</P>
<P>There was some indication that heterogeneity for the primary outcome might relate to differences in effectiveness between SSRI types. However, there were too few studies of specific SSRIs to determine whether any particular SSRI appeared substantially more effective than any other, and subgroup analyses require very cautious interpretation. Direct head-to-head comparisons of different SSRIs would help determine their relative effectiveness and we propose that future updates of this review include such comparisons.</P>
<P>Several of the trials included in this analysis had a single-blind placebo run-in stage to exclude placebo responders, and exclusion of placebo responders may yield estimates of effect that differ from findings in an unselected population. A subgroup analysis of studies without placebo run-in protocols was carried out, which found a large effect size in the SSRI group, suggesting that the benefit of SSRIs may be stronger in an unselected population than in placebo responders. However subgroup findings require very cautious interpretation and, moreover, there was substantial heterogeneity for this analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%).</P>
<P>Studies have reported a high risk of relapse following cessation of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundblad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sundblad 1997</LINK>). The risk appears to be highest in women with severe symptoms at baseline and in those who do not achieve remission, and it has been suggested that these factors be considered when determining the optimum duration of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-14 22:50:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the study quality was poor, with only four studies reporting acceptable methods of randomisation and allocation concealment and nine studies at high risk of either attrition bias or selective reporting bias. For most studies the risk of bias was unclear, largely due to poor reporting of methods. The overall quality of the evidence for the main findings was graded as low to moderate using the GRADE criteria, due to the suboptimal quality of most of the included studies and moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%) in one of the primary analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-14 22:53:18 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Efforts were made to retrieve all eligible studies. However, it is likely that some unpublished studies were not retrieved. This is mainly because efforts to contact pharmaceutical companies, in 2013, were unsuccessful in most cases; automated responses were received but no information was sent. GlaxoSmithKline have recently undertaken to make unpublished data available (<LINK REF="REF-Glaxo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaxo 2012</LINK>), and hence we were able to add to this review three unpublished studies on paroxetine dating from 1996. This raises the possibility that there may be other unpublished data that we are unable to access.</P>
<P>The choice of end scores (where reported) rather than change scores had the potential to influence effect estimates for the primary outcome. We considered including an additional analysis pooling all studies that reported change scores for the primary outcome, but we found that this allowed only two additional studies to be included in the analysis of change scores for moderate dose SSRIs. Other studies did not report effect estimates in a form which permitted the standard deviations of the change score to be extracted or calculated.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-14 22:57:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of behavioural and pharmacological interventions for PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinstauber-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinstauber 2012</LINK>) included 14 RCTs of SSRIs versus no treatment, wait list or placebo, and found that SSRIs were associated with a small to moderate benefit for PMS symptoms. Similarly, an earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Halbreich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halbreich 2008</LINK>), which included 14 placebo-controlled RCTs of SSRIs for PMS, concluded that even though SSRIs are effective for many women with PMDD, alternative targeted treatments need to be developed since around 40% of women fail to respond to SSRIs.</P>
<P>A systematic review of 19 RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK>) also found SSRIs effective for treating PMS and PMDD compared to placebo (OR 0.40, 95% 0.31 to 0.51), with substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66%). In subgroup analysis, luteal dosing was found to be less effective than continuous administration (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.68; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42, respectively).</P>
<P>The current review found no convincing evidence of a significant difference in effectiveness between luteal and continuous dosing (<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-015.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.2</LINK>). The difference in findings between the current review and <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK> may possibly be due to differences in data management. In <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK>, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Veeninga-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Veeninga 1990</LINK> (which was excluded from the current review), the three studies with the lowest effect estimates were studies of luteal phase SSRIs in which change scores had been converted to end scores by the review authors. In the current review, a) studies reporting end scores tended to report higher effect estimates than those reporting change scores, b) all studies of continuous administration reported end scores, and c) studies reporting end scores were not pooled with those reporting change scores.</P>
<P>A small (n = 36) open-label RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>) comparing intermittent versus continuous paroxetine found that luteal and continuous administration were both effective for treating symptoms of PMDD. Effects were maintained over six months of follow-up and did not differ significantly between the groups. This study was not included in the current review because there was no placebo group.</P>
<P>As the authors of <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK> suggest, more head-to-head trials of luteal versus continuous dosing strategies are needed to provide conclusive evidence on this point. Such studies should report both effectiveness and adverse effects.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis by type of SSRI in <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK> found no significant difference in effectiveness between the most commonly used SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline).</P>

<P>There is now very convincing evidence to support the use of SSRIs for reducing the symptoms of PMS. All doses appear effective, but there is a dose-response effect that applies both to symptom reduction and to adverse events. High doses of SSRIs may be intolerable. This review suggests that both intermittent and continuous dosing regimens are effective in reducing symptoms. </P>
<P>In most instances the choice of SSRI dose and type of administration could be based on an individual woman's preference and modified according to the effectiveness and tolerability of the chosen regimen.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-14 22:59:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should focus on direct comparisons between different SSRI administration regimens, including their safety, tolerability and effectiveness for overall symptoms and for specific symptom types over long-term follow-up. Head-to-head comparisons of the effectiveness and tolerability of different SSRIs may also be useful, and such comparisons should be included in future updates of this review. A multiple treatment meta-analysis (network meta analysis or mixed treatment comparisons) should also be considered for this topic. Primary studies should report full statistical information with standard deviations for all continuous outcomes to facilitate their inclusion in meta-analysis.</P>
