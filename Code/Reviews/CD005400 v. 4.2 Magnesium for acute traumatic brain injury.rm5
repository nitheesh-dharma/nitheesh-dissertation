<P>Traumatic head injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the teenage population, primarily arising from traffic accidents. The estimated annual cost of treating and rehabilitating victims of head injury is approximately US$2Billion in the United States alone. Most of the neurological damage occurs at the time of injury, though the hours or days following the injury account for addition damage. It is believed that excessive calcium entry into the cells is the biggest threat to brain damage, in which the calcium excess ultimately leads to increased free radicals, proteolysis, initiation of apoptosis, and inflammation. As one of the most important ions in the central nervous system, magnesium is important in various physiological effects, such as ischemia, cellular energy metabolism, and protein synthesis. Magnesium is also a potent calcium channel blocker, and helps to control intracellular calcium activity. Magnesium increases cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. Low levels of magnesium can lead to an increase of intracellular calcium levels. Hypomagnesaemia is a risk to head injuries, and this has been associated with poor neurological outcome and increased mortality. Restoring the levels of magnesium may reduce edema, improve neurological and cognitive outcomes, and help with problems associated with ischemia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-27 13:44:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Acute traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in young adults. Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological tools have been investigated and considered as potential mechanisms for improving neurological outcome. Magnesium has been considered as one of these potential therapeutic tools because of its activity on NMDA-receptors, calcium channels and neuron membranes. Animal studies have indicated a beneficial effect of magnesium on outcome after brain injury, but its efficacy in humans is unknown.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-27 14:57:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-27 14:57:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Traumatic head injury is a major public health problem worldwide and is a leading cause of death and disability in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Jennett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennett 1996</LINK>). Road traffic crashes account for the majority of serious head injuries and the global incidence of road traffic injury is increasing rapidly (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1995</LINK>). Most fatal and serious road traffic injuries are in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>). The cost to society of head injury is considerable. In the USA, it is estimated that the cost of treatment and rehabilitation for patients with head injury is around two billion US$ per year (<LINK REF="REF-McGarry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGarry 2002</LINK>). The identification of effective but inexpensive and widely practicable treatments for head injury is of enormous public health importance.</P>
<P>Although much of the neurological damage after traumatic head injury is caused at the time of the injury, the cascade of patho-physiological processes that occur in the hours or days immediately following the injury is believed to exacerbate the damage. These secondary insults to the brain are multi-factorial but excessive calcium entry into the cells is believed to be the most important (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 1998</LINK>). The excess of calcium leads to activation of calcium-dependent intracellular enzyme systems, causing increased production of free radicals, proteolysis and subsequent initiation of apoptosis and inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1996</LINK>). The activation of NMDA-receptors secondary to a massive release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate) is also believed to play an important role in the secondary damage (<LINK REF="REF-Faden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faden 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-27 14:56:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>In the context of traumatic brain injury, the magnesium ion has some potential as a therapeutic agent. Magnesium is the second most common intracellular cation (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcett-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcett 1999</LINK>) and is one of the most important ions in the central nervous system (CNS). It has a number of physiological effects in various cellular processes related to ischaemia. It is an important cofactor in cellular energy metabolism and protein synthesis, involved in the trans-membrane ion exchanges that occur during depolarisation and re-polarisation (<LINK REF="REF-Altura-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altura 1984</LINK>). It is a potent calcium channel blocker (<LINK REF="REF-Iseri-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iseri 1984</LINK>) and a modulator of intracellular calcium activity by non-competitive NMDA-receptor channel inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Faden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1999</LINK>). Its effects are not limited to the CNS; it increases both cardiac output and cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Belfort-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfort 1992</LINK>). Low levels of magnesium can generate an impairment of the ATPase pump function (<LINK REF="REF-Dacey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dacey 2001</LINK>), leading to a reduction of intracellular ATP and thus increasing the intracellular calcium levels.</P>
<P>Head injured patients are at high risk of developing hypomagnesaemia, which can persist for several days (<LINK REF="REF-Kahraman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahraman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polderman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polderman 2000</LINK>). Animal head injury models have demonstrated that this reduction in magnesium levels is associated with poor neurological outcome and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Vink-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vink 1988</LINK>), while restoring these levels reduces brain oedema, and improves neurological and cognitive outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hoane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoane 1998</LINK>). Magnesium also ameliorates the cellular changes secondary to global ischaemia in trauma, reduces the incidence of seizures, and prevents anoxic axonal injury (<LINK REF="REF-Bareyre-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bareyre 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, magnesium is widely available, inexpensive and has predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-27 14:52:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>As there is a theoretical potential for magnesium administration to improve outcome following traumatic brain injury, there has been growing interest in the use of this intervention in the context of randomized controlled trials. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials aims to quantify the evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium administration in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with traumatic brain injury.</P>

<P>The Temkin study was divided in two for the purpose of analysis.

<P>A total of 574 patients from 3 randomized controlled studies were included.</P>
<P>There was a good balance in the baseline characteristics of the placebo and treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Temkin_x0028_LD_x0029_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Temkin(LD)2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Temkin_x0028_HD_x0029_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Temkin(HD)2007</LINK>. In 95% of cases the intervention/placebo was given for the duration of time pre-specified in the protocol; the remaining 5% was due to early discharge or death. The study was un-blinded for medical reasons in 40 patients and the study nurse was aware of the treatment in 4% of the cases. The target level of magnesium was achieved in 100% of the patients. Group 1: 1.45 mmil/L (SD 0.2) and group 2: 2.15 mmol/L (SD 0.35); the placebo group reached a level of 0.9 mmol/L (SD 0.1).<BR/>
<BR/>Both the primary and the secondary analysis show that the infusion of magnesium did not demonstrate a positive effect. When the higher treatment dose was used, the relative risk for mortality was 2.40 (intervention vs. placebo).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 13:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two of the included trials <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004</LINK> have important deficiencies which make the data difficult to interpret. Allocation concealment was inadequate in both trials and there was no information about blinding. There was also no information on loss to follow-up.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Temkin_x0028_HD_x0029_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Temkin(HD)2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Temkin_x0028_LD_x0029_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Temkin(LD)2007</LINK> is a well designed randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. However, the effectiveness of the low-dose intervention could be due to the play of chance.</P>
<P>The currently available evidence does not support the use of magnesium in brain-injured patients. There is no evidence to support the use of magnesium as a treatment to improve neurological outcome and mortality in patients with acute traumatic brain injury.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently no evidence to support the use of magnesium in patients with acute traumatic brain injury.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further adequately concealed, randomized controlled trials of magnesium in brain injured patients are required.</P>
