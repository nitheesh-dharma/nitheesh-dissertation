<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Chronic palmoplantar pustulosis is a skin disease where repeated crops of painful yellow pus spots form on the palms and soles, often over many years. Many different treatments have been used including topical creams and ointments, drugs by mouth and ultraviolet radiation. The review of trials found that several treatments improve the symptoms of chronic palmoplantar pustulosis, although no treatment was shown to suppress the condition completely. Oral retinoid therapy (acitretin) appears to be helpful at relieving symptoms, particularly if combined with PUVA. Ciclosporin and tetracycline antibiotics can also provide some relief. Topical treatments were generally less helpful. As yet there is no ideal treatment for chronic palmoplantar pustulosis, though oral retinoids, particularly when combined with psoralens and ultraviolet radiation (PUVA), may help</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by crops of sterile pustules (yellow pus spots) on the palms and soles which erupt repeatedly over months or years. The affected areas tend to become red and scaly; cracks may form and these are often painful. Many different treatments have been used for palmoplantar pustulosis but none is generally accepted as being reliably effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of treatments for palmoplantar pustulosis, both in reducing disease severity and in maintaining remission once achieved.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to February 2003). We also cross-checked with the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials and reference lists of articles. We also contacted authors included trials, members of the Cochrane Skin Group and dermatologists interested in psoriasis. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Any randomised controlled trial in which patients with chronic palmoplantar pustulosis were randomised to receive one or more interventions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>At least two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 724 people were included. There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 28 to 59%), oral PUVA (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 26 to 62%). However, a combination of PUVA and retinoids is better than the individual treatments. The use of topical steroid under hydrocolloid occlusion is beneficial. It would also appear that low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful in treating PPP. Colchicine has a lot of side effects and it is unclear if it is effective and neither was topical PUVA (rate difference of 0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to +0.04). There is no evidence to suggest that short-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) is effective. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Many different interventions were reported to produce "improvement" in PPP. There is, however, no standardised method for assessing response to treatment, and reductions in pustule counts or other empirical semi-quantitative scoring systems may be of little relevance to the patient. This review has shown that the ideal treatment for PPP remains elusive and that the standards of study design and reporting need to be improved to inform patients and those treating them of the relative merits of the many treatments available to them.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:15:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition/biology </HEADING>
<P>Chronic palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by crops of sterile pustules (yellow pus spots) on the palms and soles which erupt repeatedly over months or years (<LINK REF="STD-Reitamo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Reitamo 1993</LINK>). The affected areas tend to become red and scaly; cracks may form and these are often painful. As it has been thought to be a variant of psoriasis it has historically been known as chronic palmoplantar pustular psoriasis and is still widely known by this name.<BR/>The relationship of PPP to psoriasis vulgaris is, however, not clear cut. Most people with the condition have no evidence of psoriasis elsewhere; the proportion that do varies in different series from 2% to 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Enfors-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enfors 1971</LINK>). Furthermore, recent genetic studies have failed to find any link between PPP and the major genetic susceptibility locus for psoriasis vulgaris, PSORS1 (<LINK REF="REF-Asumalahti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asumalahti 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, histologically it closely resembles psoriasis and it does occur in the presence of typical psoriasis elsewhere, or if this is a personal or family history of psoriasis. Many dermatologists are thus happy to regard it as a localised pustular variant of psoriasis. It must be differentiated from acute palmoplantar pustulosis (pustular bacterid) and from other pustular forms of psoriasis affecting the hands and feet (for example, acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or acropustulosis).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>A strong association with smoking has been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kubeyinje-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubeyinje 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nymann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nymann 1996</LINK>; O'Doherty 1985; <LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1988</LINK>) but there is no evidence that, once the condition has developed, stopping smoking improves this form of psoriasis. PPP may also be associated with an arthritis of the anterior thorax (sternocostoclavicular, manubriosternal or sternocostal joints) (<LINK REF="REF-Edlund-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edlund 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jurik-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jurik 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Loet-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Loet 1991</LINK>) or with abnormalities of thyroid function (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1988</LINK>). A recent study from Sweden suggested that PPP is an autoimmune disease: circulating antibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of normal palmoplantar skin were detected in the sera of 42% of patients with PPP, whereas none were seen in patients with chronic hand eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Hagforsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagforsen 2002</LINK>). There has been little investigation into the role of stress in PPP but in one small study (Saez-Rodriguez 2002) anxiety scores were found to be higher in patients with PPP than in controls. The authors suggested that stress and exacerbations of PPP may be related.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>PPP tends to run a prolonged course with intermittent exacerbations followed by partial but rarely complete remissions. It may cause minimal symptoms but often represents a debilitating illness which interferes not only with work but also with everyday activities involving the hands and with mobility. It may also be socially stigmatising. A burning discomfort is common. Intolerable itch may occur. The affected areas have a tendency to crack and fissure and this may increase discomfort. Once PPP has developed it may persist for decades.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:16:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Therapy is unsatisfactory (<LINK REF="REF-Camp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 1998</LINK>). Topical treatments tend to be ineffective though some patients with mild disease may obtain relief from emollient creams or ointments alone. Many different systemic therapies (treatments administered remote from their site of action,usually by mouth or by injection) have been tried. None can reliably suppress the condition and none is curative. Interventions which have been advocated for palmoplantar pustulosis include coal tar, topical corticosteroids with or without polythene occlusion, photochemotherapy, oral tetracyclines, methotrexate, systemic retinoids and ciclosporin. Of these, dermatologists appear in general to have found topical psoralen photochemotherapy and systemic retinoids of most value (<LINK REF="REF-Camp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:16:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>PPP is a disabling condition for sufferers and a frustrating condition for dermatologists to manage. Many treatments are used and some are potentially toxic. There are significant cost differences between different treatment methods but there is little information regarding their relative efficacy. The current review is intended to address these questions and, where appropriate, point to areas requiring further research.</P>

<P>At least two authors (AMM, RJGC) examined all identified citations. If it was felt that the citation referred to a clinical trial of PPP, we obtained reprints and scrutinised these to determine whether the diagnostic criteria, randomisation methods and outcome measurements enabled a satisfactory comparison of interventions. If these details were unclear, we wrote to authors requesting further clarification. Non-randomised clinical studies were excluded. All relevant studies were evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration guidelines as set out in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook and two members of the Review Group independently assessed these before being included in the review. Excluded studies and reasons for exclusion are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:30:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Two authors (AMM, RJGC) extracted data and this was then checked by a third (SH). If the details were unclear or were missing we attempted to contact the authors but did not receive any replies. Since a variety of scoring methods were used across the eligible trials, we elected to analyse dichotomous outcome data where possible. We examined each RCT to see whether this outcome data was reported or whether the outcomes could be transformed into dichotomous data (e.g. "improved/not improved" or "cleared/not cleared").</P>
<P>No attempt was made to extract or analyse continuous data, such as pustule counts, unless no other information was reported. If it was felt that the trials were sufficiently homogeneous in design, methodology and outcome, these data were pooled.</P>

<P>We based a subjective assessment of methodological quality on the following four criteria, where each component was categorised as adequate, unclear, or inadequate:<BR/>(a) concealment of allocation (we deemed adequate in any sequence where the treatment assignment cannot be foreseen);<BR/>(b) method of generation of randomisation sequences;<BR/>(c) blinding of outcome assessor, participant and care-giver (we deemed adequate when outcome assessor, participant and/or care-giver are unaware of the treatment assignment);<BR/>(d) comparability of treatment groups at baseline.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:33:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Rate differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as the main measure of effect to allow for comprehensibility of the results. We have also, however, reported rate ratios. We elected to use the term rate rather than risk, because we were interested in positive outcome measures. Newcombe's method was used to calculate confidence intervals for paired proportions from within-patient designs (<LINK REF="REF-Newcombe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcombe 1998</LINK>), since insufficient data could be extracted from the publications to allow for conditional effect measures to be calculated. However, the data were included in graphs when the confidence intervals obtained were very similar to those obtained with the correct paired analysis. We analysed separately and did not pool parallel group and within-patient comparisons. We reported continuous data from within a single trial as mean differences with 95% CI.<BR/>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:34:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We examined the studies to ensure that intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used in all studies; the texts were scrutinised for drop-outs and results were adjusted if necessary to count these as treatment failures. Whilst by convention it is assumed that participants who drop out of trials have not responded, it may be that participants drop out because their condition has cleared and they decide not to return to their physician. The numbers of drop-outs involved were small and we did not undertake a sensitivity analysis. Within the treatment groups themselves, study designs were broadly similar (thus all phototherapy trials were within-patient whereas retinoid comparisons were parallel group) and it was felt that it was reasonable to pool data and subject them to meta-analyses. We used a random effects model for all comparisons of pooled data. </P>

<P>The 23 trials which were included in the review, involving 724 people, contained 27 randomised comparisons which fell into nine broad categories (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section). Some reports contained more than one comparison. The majority of included RCTs were of retinoid therapy, photochemotherapy or combinations of both. We also found studies examining Grenz ray therapy, ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), colchicine and topical corticosteroids. Within these therapeutic categories, it was possible to make comparisons and pool data as the populations, disease parameters and treatment methods appeared to be broadly similar. Outcome measures were very variable. Most studies used some semi-quantitative method of scoring based on degrees of erythema, scaling, fissuring and pustulation as assessed objectively. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bhushan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bhushan 2001</LINK>) gave useful information from the patients' own assessments of treatment efficacy.</P>

<P>In general, we felt the methodological quality of trials was poor.

No trial examining standard interventions was considered by these criteria to be of high quality.

<P>In order to minimise bias, randomisation and concealment of allocation are essential components of a RCT.

<P>Chronic palmoplantar pustulosis can persist for decades once established but during this time there may be periods of remission. It would appear sensible therefore to assess any intervention after a reasonable time period. Most of the trials used study periods of 8-12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Bhushan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bhushan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foged-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Foged 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassus-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lassus 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lassus 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Layton-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Layton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsunami-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsunami 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1985" TYPE="STUDY">White 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>) which can be considered barely adequate.

<P>Of the eight trials examining the use of systemic retinoids, six compared etretinate with placebo, one (<LINK REF="STD-Lassus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lassus 1988</LINK>) compared acitretin with etretinate and one (<LINK REF="STD-Bhushan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bhushan 2001</LINK>) compared liarozole with placebo (Analyses 1 to 3).</P>

Forty-eight of 67 (72%) patients who received retinoids as compared with 17 of the 60 (28%) patients who received placebo showed some improvement (rate difference 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.59; rate ratio 2.54, 95% CI 1.65 to 3.91). When using good or excellent response as an outcome measure, 26 of 67 (39%) patients who received retinoids as compared with 10 of 60 (17%) who received placebo achieved a good or excellent response (rate difference 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.36; rate ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.46).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Retinoids compared</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lassus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lassus 1988</LINK> found no difference in efficacy between etretinate and acitretin, as measured by reduction in the number of pustules (mean difference 3.24 95% CI -29.13 to 35.61; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Note</I>: Retinoids are teratogenic (may induce birth defects) and must therefore be strictly avoided in early pregnancy. As there is concern that etretinate, the first systemic retinoid to be released, is retained in fat stores for prolonged periods after discontinuation of therapy, a safer alternative was sought. The active moiety of etretinate was thought to be its hydrolysis product, acitretin, which is much more rapidly eliminated from the body than the parent compound. As a result of comparative clinical studies both in psoriasis vulgaris and in PPP showing little difference in efficacy and because of the presumed greater safety of acitretin, etretinate was withdrawn from the market. It was subsequently shown, however, that esterification of acitretin to etretinate may occur in vivo, particularly in the presence of alcohol. The disadvantages of systemic retinoid therapy for women of child-bearing potential therefore remain. It seems reasonable to conclude that the effects of the two drugs in PPP are broadly similar and that the conclusions from trials of etretinate may be extrapolated to acitretin.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Induction of remission using liarozole</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bhushan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bhushan 2001</LINK> conducted a small study showing marked improvement in four out of seven patients receiving liarozole compared with one out of eight patients receiving placebo (rate difference 0.45, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.88; rate ratio 4.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.89; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The study incorporated analysable data for individual patients' own assessments of efficacy: five out of seven patients receiving liarozole and three out of eight receiving placebo indicated some possible improvement of symptoms at the end of the intervention period (change in visual analogue score, rate difference 0.34, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.81; rate ratio 1.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 5.23), although this did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<I>Note</I>: Liarozole is an imidazole-like compound which inhibits the cytochrome P450-mediated breakdown of all-trans retinoic acid (RA). This inhibition causes elevation of plasma and cutaneous levels of RA and thus liarozole acts in a similar way to retinoid drugs. It is sometimes termed a "retinoid mimetic" for this reason. A commercial decision was taken not to market liarozole.</P>

Lassus used topical and systemic PUVA and Rosen used oral PUVA. The study by Rosen showed no benefit of retinoids over PUVA but the data from Lassus, who had generally disappointing results with PUVA, appears to demonstrate an advantage with retinoids (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).

The design of two of these was complex in that patients were randomised into two parallel groups (oral retinoid or placebo) and then every patient received PUVA to one hand, foot or side (hand and foot) only (<LINK REF="STD-Matsunami-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsunami 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK> - <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>). In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 1984</LINK>) all patients received PUVA but were similarly randomised into retinoid and placebo groups (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Re-PUVA versus PUVA</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Matsunami-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsunami 1990</LINK> reported that six of 10 (60%) sides cleared with topical PUVA-etretinate compared with 1 of 10 (10%) sides with topical PUVA alone (rate difference 0.50, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.86; rate ratio 6.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 41.22, <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 1984</LINK> found that all eight patients treated with PUVA-etretinate cleared compared with five out of nine patients treated with PUVA alone and <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK> found that the PUVA-treated sites cleared in 14 of 23 patients randomised to etretinate compared with 3 of 14 patients randomised to placebo. If these data are combined then 22 of 31(71%) cleared with oral PUVA-etretinate compared with 8 of 23 (35%) with oral PUVA alone (rate difference 0.41, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.64 (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>); rate ratio 2.26, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.11, <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). If the topical and oral PUVA data is added then it can be shown that 28 of 41 (68%) cleared with PUVA-etretinate compared with 9 of 33 (27%) receiving PUVA alone (rate difference 0.44,95% CI 0.24 to 0.63; rate ratio 2.66, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.75; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Re-PUVA versus retinoid</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK> showed that 17 of 23 (74%) sites were much improved or cleared with PUVA-etretinate compared with 10 of 23 (43%) sites with etretinate alone (rate difference 0.30, insufficient detail available to calculate 95% CI; worst case p=0.17, <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). It was not possible to analyse lesser responses than clearance in the small study by <LINK REF="STD-Matsunami-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsunami 1990</LINK>, where 6 of 10 (60%) sites cleared with Re-PUVA as against 2 of 10 (20%) sites with retinoid alone (rate difference 0.40, rate ratio 3.00). Clearance was achieved in 14 of Rosen's 23 Re-PUVA-treated sites (61%) compared with 3 of 23 (13%) sites which received no PUVA (rate difference 0.48, rate ratio 4.67).</P>
<P>
<I>Note</I>: The within patient data from <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Matsunami-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsunami 1990</LINK> could not be appropriately analysed in RevMan but more suitable methods gave very similar results in this case. Insufficient details were available to calculate correct confidence intervals; the worst case p values were 0.01 and 0.29 respectively. Since the estimates from the two studies were similar, this gives reasonable evidence of benefit of re-PUVA over retinoid from the two studies combined (rate difference 0.45, rate ratio 4.00,<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1973</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1976</LINK>) examined the use of a tetracycline (tetracycline for one month and clomocycline for three months respectively). Pooled data showed improvement in 30 of 80 (38%) tetracycline treatment courses compared with 10 of 80 (13%) placebo courses (rate difference 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.37; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Note</I>: These were both crossover studies and so could not be analysed appropriately within RevMan. For <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1973</LINK> the first period data were extracted whereas both periods are included for <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1976</LINK> and so this is not a paired analysis. However, the confidence interval for a correct paired analysis is very similar to that shown in RevMan. The difference between placebo and tetracycline antibiotic is less obvious in the three month study with clomocycline than the one lasting one month with tetracycline, but an advantage is still apparent. <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1973</LINK> stated that in some cases of improvement the lesions disappeared completely, but in most cases no more than an 'improvement' was recorded.

Both studies reported high rates of side effects related to the use of colchicine, including diarrhoea, headaches and nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK>). None of the patients 'responded' in the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK>. There were 13 documented 'improvements' in that reported by <LINK REF="STD-Thestrup_x002d_Pedersen-84" TYPE="STUDY">Thestrup-Pedersen 84</LINK>: 10 of 27 patients improved when receiving colchicine compared with 3 of 27 when receiving placebo (rate difference 0.26, insufficient details to calculate 95% CI, worst case 0.004 to 0.44).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Few high quality studies were identified in the review. The majority were short-term studies in a chronic disease subject to relapses and remissions. Many studies used non-standardised semi-quantitative scores as outcome measures and few reported patient satisfaction measures. Documented superiority over placebo does not necessarily equate to worthwhile benefit for the patient. It is also of course possible that failure to report negative trials has resulted in an overestimate of benefit for some of the interventions examined in this review. The heterogeneity of outcome measurement and methodology makes pooling of statistical data difficult. Within these trials other distinguishing variables were identifiable:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient factors </HEADING>
<P>Most trials demonstrated that groups were matched for age, sex, length and history of previous treatment and site of lesions. The proportion of patients with evidence of concomitant psoriasis elsewhere varied considerably and it is not known whether this may influence responses to therapy. As PPP is a chronic relapsing-remitting condition, many patients had received previous treatments for their disease. It is not known whether the response of patients to treatment for an initial episode differs from the response seen in those who have received multiple previous treatments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment factors</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Oral Treatments: different drugs, doses and formulations of tetracyclines and retinoids</LI>
<LI>Topical PUVA: different concentrations, formulations and methods of application of psoralen; different irradiation doses and regimens.</LI>

<P>Whether or not there is a difference between hands and feet in the probability of response to treatment is a question which was not discussed by most researchers. In an uncontrolled trial which could not be included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Agren_x002d_Jonsson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agren-Jonsson 1985</LINK>), palmar disease appeared to respond much more readily than plantar disease to treatment with systemic PUVA.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:59:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>With the exception of corticosteroids under occlusion, there is little evidence for efficacy of topical therapy in PPP. The efficacy of topical corticosteroids is increased by occlusion with hydrocolloid gel dressings: such therapy may be expected to affect clearance within 12 days in about two thirds of people with PPP. This remission may, however, be short-lived. There is some evidence to suggest that additional short-term PUVA does not prevent relapse. We found no eligible studies examining other topical therapies such as tar, anthralin, calcipotriol or tazarotene. Grenz Ray therapy has been shown to produce moderate improvement in about two-thirds of patients with PPP. There are no studies examining the use of this as an adjunct to other interventions. There is little evidence from RCTs to support the use of topical PUVA. </P>
<P>Systemic photochemotherapy and systemic retinoids are both of value for PPP. Systemic PUVA can induce clearance in up to two fifths of people with PPP though larger studies are needed to confirm this figure. Systemic retinoids (etretinate and acitretin) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day produce objective improvement in about two thirds of people with PPP. A good or excellent response is seen in about two fifths. Many patients who do improve will not, however, achieve satisfactory control of disease either because of an insufficient response or because of intolerance of retinoid side effects. Continuation of retinoid therapy after induction of remission reduces the incidence of relapse. Limited data suggest that liarozole might be similarly efficacious in producing objective improvement in PPP. Comparison between retinoids and PUVA suggests that retinoids are more likely to induce clearance but there is little difference in the proportions of people who will show improvement. A combination of systemic retinoids and PUVA produces clearance in about two-thirds of people with PPP, and compares favourably with PUVA or retinoid therapy alone.</P>
<P>There is evidence that ciclosporin and tetracycline antibiotics may be of some benefit for PPP. Ciclosporin at low dose (1 to 2.5 mg/kg bw/day) produces moderate objective improvement in about two-thirds of patients over one month. The evidence which suggests that about one-fourth of patients may be expected to maintain the improvement gained for one year needs confirmation by further studies. The response rates reported in uncontrolled studies and case series using higher doses of ciclosporin suggest that the doses used in published studies may be suboptimal; further studies using higher doses are required to establish whether this is so. Tetracycline antibiotics produce objective improvement in about half of patients with PPP. Clearance is rarely seen.</P>
<P>There is a paucity of evidence supporting the use of colchicine in PPP. There is no evidence to suggest that short term treatment with hydroxycarbamide is effective in PPP. There are no randomised controlled trials to date that support the use of methotrexate, although one uncontrolled prospective study claimed benefit in only a third of treated patients, mainly those people with evidence of psoriasis at other sites (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1971</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-18 12:59:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The clinical outcomes of trials for PPP are not standardised and this makes it difficult to compare studies. Although many investigators use changes in pustule counts or clinical scores of erythema and scaling, these on their own are insufficient. It should always be possible to dichotomise the results into categories such as improved/not improved or clear/not clear. Of equal importance are the assessments of patients receiving the treatment both in terms of efficacy and acceptability.</P>
<P>We suggest that future trials should report specifically:</P>
<UL>
<LI>numbers of patients randomised into each treatment arm as well as the numbers completing each arm according to protocol</LI>
<LI>numbers of randomised patients who achieve clearance</LI>
<LI>numbers of randomised patients who show objective improvement</LI>
<LI>numbers of randomised patients who report significant benefit</LI>
<LI>numbers of randomised patients who regard the intervention as acceptable or "worth-while"</LI>
</UL>
<P>We also suggest that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the presence or absence of evidence of psoriasis at other body sites should be recorded</LI>
<LI>trial design should incorporate separate stratification for this</LI>
<LI>data should be presented in such a way that differential response rates of hand and feet can be identified</LI>
</UL>
<P>Further studies of systemic PUVA against placebo may help to determine more precisely the proportion of people who may be expected to clear with PUVA and to clarify the differences in response rates to systemic PUVA reported by <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1987</LINK> on the one hand and <LINK REF="STD-Lassus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lassus 1988</LINK> on the other. There is much uncertainty as to the efficacy of topical PUVA in PPP and, ideally, a treatment arm using topical PUVA should be included in order to determine whether this modality has any place in its management. A study of ciclosporin at a dose of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg bw/day would help to establish the value of this drug for PPP.</P>
<P>A comparison of liarozole with acitretin would help to establish whether the former can achieve response rates to compare with acitretin and, if so, whether it offers benefits in terms of reduced side effects.</P>
<P>A comparison of methotrexate with acitretin would establish whether there is a place for the former in the management of PPP.</P>
<P>In view of the encouraging reports regarding the use of oral pimecrolimus in the treatment of psoriasis, and of its apparent improved side-effect profile over ciclosporin, a study of this drug as a treatment for PPP would seem appropriate. Although there have been anecdotal reports that the new biological agents which have been introduced for psoriasis may be beneficial in PPP, RCTs should be performed to evaluate their efficacy.</P>

<P>We undertook a validation check by cross-checking with the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials for trials containing the keyword term PALMOPLANTAR PUSTULAR PSORIASIS. The Salford Database is derived from searches of MEDLINE (from 1966 to 1999) and EMBASE (from 1988 to 1999) using the terms STUDY or TRIAL* or RANDOM* in the text, COMPAR* in the title or CLINICAL-TRIAL in the subject heading; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); and the European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database. We screened and retrieved all retrieved studies by disease type and by intervention including PALMOPLANTAR PUSTULAR PSORIASIS.</P>
