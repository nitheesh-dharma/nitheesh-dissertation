There tends to be more reporting in full text papers. This affects most of the studies reported as abstract. We consistently rated studies as 'unclear' risk of bias for this domain where we didn't know if all the outcomes were reported, and 'high' where the studies had clearly not reported all the outcomes. We could cahnge all of them if you would like us to do so, but we thought this was a fair assessment based on the information we had available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;summary of findings tables &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add the follow up time to the first column Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add the MD to the 4th column Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we tend to write units mg/kg/min throughout reviews rather than mg.kg.min- the style guide says that &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; should be used for 'per' Changed as requested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUgust 7th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for responding to the comments from the Peer Reviewer.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:52:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>We reviewed available evidence on the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on exercise capacity, shortness of breath and quality of life in people with interstitial lung disease (ILD).</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> People with ILD often have reduced exercise capacity and shortness of breath during exercise. Pulmonary rehabilitation can improve well-being in people with other chronic lung disease, but little is known regarding pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD. We wanted to discover whether pulmonary rehabilitation was safe for people with ILD, and whether it provided advantages over usual care. We also looked at whether people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a type of ILD that can progress rapidly, could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> Nine studies were included; however only five studies provided sufficient information for the analysis (86 participants receiving pulmonary rehabilitation and 82 participants not receiving pulmonary rehabilitation). Three studies included only people with IPF, and the other six studies included people with a variety of ILDs. The average age of participants ranged from 36 to 71 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> No reports described unwelcome effects of pulmonary rehabilitation. Immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation, participants could walk farther than those who had not undertaken pulmonary rehabilitation (on average, 44 metres farther in six minutes). Participants also improved their maximum exercise capacity and reported less shortness of breath and improved quality of life. People with IPF also experienced improvements in exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life following pulmonary rehabilitation. Information was insufficient to establish whether ongoing effects were noted once pulmonary rehabilitation had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> Because of inadequate reporting of methods and small numbers of participants, the quality of evidence was low to moderate.</P>
<P>This Cochrane plain language summary is current to June 2014.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:51:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is characterised by reduced functional capacity, dyspnoea and exercise-induced hypoxia. Pulmonary rehabilitation, an intervention that includes exercise training, is beneficial for people with other chronic lung conditions; however its effects in ILD have not been well characterised.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:51:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>&#8226; To determine whether pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with ILD has beneficial effects on exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life and survival compared with no pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with ILD.</P>
<P>&#8226; To assess the safety of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with ILD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:51:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (all searched from inception to June 2014). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies, international clinical trial registries and respiratory conference abstracts to look for qualifying studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:51:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in which pulmonary rehabilitation was compared with no pulmonary rehabilitation or with other therapy in people with ILD of any origin were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-30 10:36:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Study authors were contacted to provide missing data and information regarding adverse effects. A priori subgroup analyses were specified for participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and participants with severe lung disease (low diffusing capacity or desaturation during exercise). We planned to subgroup according to training modality applied, but there were insufficient data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-30 10:37:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Nine studies were included, six of which were published as abstracts. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis (86 participants who undertook pulmonary rehabilitation and 82 control participants). One study used a blinded assessor and intention-to-treat analysis. No adverse effects of pulmonary rehabilitation were reported. Pulmonary rehabilitation improved the six-minute walk distance with weighted mean difference (WMD) of 44.34 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.04 to 62.64 metres) and improved oxygen consumption (VO<SUB>2</SUB>) peak with WMD of 1.24 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% CI 0.46 to 2.03 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP>). Improvements in six-minute walk distance and VO<SUB>2</SUB> peak were also seen in the subgroup of participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (WMD 35.63 metres, 95% CI 16.02 to 55.23 metres; WMD 1.46 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP>, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.39 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively). Reduced dyspnoea (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.66, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.28) following pulmonary rehabilitation was also seen in the IPF subgroup (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.25). Quality of life improved following pulmonary rehabilitation for all participants on a variety of measures (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.98) and for the subgroup of people with IPF (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.03). Two studies reported longer-term outcomes, with no significant effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on clinical variables or survival at three or six months. Available data were insufficient to allow examination of the impact of disease severity or exercise training modality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:52:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation seems to be safe for people with ILD. Improvements in functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life are seen immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation, with benefits also evident in IPF. Because of inadequate reporting of methods and small numbers of included participants, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. Little evidence was available regarding longer-term effects of pulmonary rehabilitation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-30 10:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-30 10:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly disabling group of conditions including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute and chronic interstitial pneumonias, connective tissue diseases and sarcoidosis. People with ILD frequently experience breathlessness on exertion, which limits their ability to undertake daily activities. Patients report low levels of physical functioning and vitality and high levels of dyspnoea and fatigue. Those with the greatest exercise limitations have the worst quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Available treatments for patients with ILD have proved largely ineffective, offering no improvement in survival and demonstrating only limited impact on quality of life.</P>
<P>The mechanisms of reduced exercise capacity in ILD are multi-factorial. Impaired gas exchange occurs as a result of destruction of the pulmonary capillary bed, resulting in ventilation-perfusion mismatch and oxygen diffusion limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Agusti-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agusti 1991</LINK>). Circulatory limitation results from pulmonary capillary destruction and pulmonary vasoconstriction and leads to pulmonary hypertension and cardiac dysfunction in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1996</LINK>). Ventilatory limitations to exercise may also occur, although these are not thought to be a major contributor in most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Harris_x002d_Eze-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris-Eze 1996</LINK>). Peripheral muscle dysfunction may play a significant role in limiting exercise capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Markovitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markovitz 1998</LINK>) as a result of physical deconditioning. Patients who experience dyspnoea and fatigue with functional activity commonly reduce their activity levels, leading to a vicious cycle of worsening exercise capacity and increasing symptoms. In addition, treatments for ILD such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy may lead to drug-induced myopathy.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation includes patient assessment, regular participation in an exercise training programme, education and behavioural change (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). The role of pulmonary rehabilitation is well established in people with other chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for whom it improves exercise performance and reduces symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). Several authors have postulated that similar effects of pulmonary rehabilitation may be seen in patients with ILD.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The mechanism by which pulmonary rehabilitation might improve outcomes in people with ILD has not been established. In people with other respiratory diseases, pulmonary rehabilitation may improve aerobic capacity and improves peripheral muscle performance (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). Effects on these outcomes in ILD are unclear. Despite this, recently published guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation have advocated its use in 'individuals with chronic respiratory disorders other than COPD' as 'there is now more robust evidence to support inclusion of some of these patient groups in pulmonary rehabilitation programs' (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). However, it has been suggested that the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD are smaller than those generally seen in COPD, and its ongoing effects are not sustained beyond six months (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). Guidelines for clinical management of both ILD (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008</LINK>) and IPF (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2011</LINK>) indicate that more information is needed on the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation for these patients. The greater prevalence of exercise-induced hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension and arrhythmia compared with other chronic lung diseases in this patient population raises the possibility that response to exercise rehabilitation may also differ (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (LD and AH) assessed the internal validity of included studies using a component approach (including sequence generation for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors, loss to follow-up, completeness of outcome assessment and other possible bias prevention).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:53:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>For continuous variables, we recorded mean change from baseline or mean postintervention values and standard deviation (SD) for each group. When measures of improvement had opposite directions of effect on different scales (e.g. quality of life scales), all improvements were recorded as positive values, and all deteriorations were recorded as negative values. Mean differences (MDs) for outcomes measured with the same metrics or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for outcomes measured with different metrics with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using RevMan 5.2. For binary outcome measures, we recorded the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, to allow intention-to-treat analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated for each study.</P>

<P>In the original version, 4783 records were identified from the initial search of databases. From the studies on this list, 15 full-text articles were retrieved for closer inspection. No additional studies were identified upon handsearching of reference lists or contact with study authors. Review authors achieved agreement on 13 of the 15 full-text articles (87%) with kappa = 0.74, indicating substantial agreement. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Five articles were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria for the original review. An update search conducted in December 2009 identified no relevant studies for inclusion in the review. The 2014 updated search of databases returned 1901 potential studies. Eight full-text articles from this list were retrieved for closer inspection. Six additional studies were identified upon handsearching of reference lists and review of international clinical trial registries and annual international respiratory conference abstracts. Correspondence with <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK> indicated that the final results of the study had been submitted and accepted for publication. Data from the accepted manuscript were used in the analysis. Agreement between review authors was achieved on 13 of the 14 full-text articles (92%) with kappa = 0.81, indicating substantial agreement. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Four studies from the updated search were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria; one article is awaiting classification and therefore was not included in the analysis. Nine articles in total from the original and updated searches were included in this review. Common reasons for exclusion were that studies were not randomised controlled trials (n = 5), studies included participants without lung disease (n = 3), studies included mixed disease groups (n = 3) and studies did not include pulmonary rehabilitation (n = 2).

The common effect (mean difference, MD) for change in distance walked was 44.34 metres in favour of the pulmonary rehabilitation group (95% CI 26.04 to 66.64 metres). A significant effect of pulmonary rehabilitation was also seen in the subgroup of participants with IPF (four trials, n = 59 pulmonary rehabilitation, n = 52 control) with a common effect of 35.63 metres (95% CI 16.02 to 55.23 metres). Only one study provided sufficient data to show the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation among participants with severe lung disease (n = 23) or in participants who desaturated (n = 30), and no significant effects of pulmonary rehabilitation were evident in these groups (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>) reported results of the six-minute walk test at six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and another study evaluated the six-minute walk test after a subsequent three-month observation period (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>). No significant effect of pulmonary rehabilitation was evident at either time point. Tests of heterogeneity for all analyses of functional exercise capacity were not significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Maximal exercise capacity</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported that cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed following pulmonary rehabilitation; however data were available from only two studies with 42 participants in the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 38 participants in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>). A significant increase in VO<SUB>2</SUB> peak was noted between baseline and follow-up with an MD of 1.24 mL/kg/min (95% CI 0.46 to 2.03 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP>) in favour of the pulmonary rehabilitation group (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). A similar effect was seen in the subgroup of participants with IPF (two trials, n = 32 pulmonary rehabilitation, n = 26 control) with a common effect of 1.46 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1 </SUP>(95% CI 0.54 to 2.39 mL/kg/min<SUP>-1</SUP>). No significant differences in VO<SUB>2</SUB> peak were observed among participants with severe lung disease or in participants who desaturated. Both studies reported that pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in a significant increase in maximum ventilation; however only one study with 57 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>) provided sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The MD between groups was 4.71 L/min<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% CI 0.10 to 9.32) in favour of the pulmonary rehabilitation group. The effect was more pronounced in the subgroup of participants with IPF (one study, 30 participants, MD 6.97 L/min<SUP>-1</SUP>, 95% CI 0.87 to 13.07). No significant effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on maximum exercise parameters were seen in the subgroups of severe disease or in desaturators. No significant effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on maximum heart rate was evident (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dyspnoea</HEADING>
<P>Dyspnoea was measured in five studies including 281 participants, with three reporting reduced dyspnoea immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Baradzina-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baradzina 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>) and two studies reporting no change (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiyama 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wewel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wewel 2005</LINK>). Data from three studies were pooled for meta-analysis with a total of 58 participants in the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 55 participants in the control group (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Two studies utilised the modified Medical Research Council Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>), and the other used the Baseline Dyspnoea Index (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiyama 2008</LINK>). The common effect (standardised mean difference, SMD) for change in dyspnoea was -0.66 in favour of the pulmonary rehabilitation group (95% CI -1.05 to -0.28). A similar reduction in dyspnoea was seen among participants with IPF (48 participants in the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 42 participants in the control group), with an MD of -0.68 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.25, three studies, 90 participants). An effect in favour of pulmonary rehabilitation was seen in participants with severe disease and in those who desaturated; however this finding reached significance only for the desaturators (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). One study reported dyspnoea at six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). No significant effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on dyspnoea was evident at this time. Tests of heterogeneity for all analyses of dyspnoea were not significant.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Health-related quality of life was measured in eight studies, with significant differences between groups reported immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiyama 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>). Two studies reported improvement in heath-related quality of life following pulmonary rehabilitation; however this finding did not reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-Bogerd-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Perez Bogerd 2011</LINK>); in the remaining studies it was unclear whether differences were noted between groups. Data were available for pooling from three studies with a total of 54 participants in the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 52 participants in the control group (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Two studies utilised the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>), one used the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiyama 2008</LINK>) and the other used the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis version) (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>). A common effect indicated improvement in quality of life associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.98). A similar effect in favour of pulmonary rehabilitation was seen in participants with IPF (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 103, three studies, 83 participants). Data regarding effects on quality of life in participants with severe disease and in those who desaturated were available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>), in which trends favouring pulmonary rehabilitation did not reach statistical significance. Data regarding longer-term effects on quality of life were available from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>) with one study reporting results at six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), and the other evaluating quality of life after a subsequent three-month observation period (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>). No effects of pulmonary rehabilitation were noted at three months or six months, except in the subgroup of participants with severe disease, who had significantly improved quality of life compared with controls at six-month follow-up (SMD 14.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 29.32, one study, 23 participants).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>This review identified nine studies comparing pulmonary rehabilitation versus no pulmonary rehabilitation or sham control among people with ILD. No adverse effects of this treatment were identified. Pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in a clear improvement in functional exercise capacity, as measured by the six-minute walk test, and a small increase in maximum exercise capacity. Significant reduction in dyspnoea and improvement in quality of life were seen immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation. Effects were similar in the subgroup of participants with IPF. Insufficient data were available to allow conclusions regarding the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation among those with severe disease and those who desaturated. To date, data are insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the long-term effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD.</P>
<P>Mean improvement in the six-minute walk test following pulmonary rehabilitation was 44.34 metres, which is similar to the mean improvement of 48 metres seen in people with COPD who have undergone pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006</LINK>). This suggests that people with ILD receive comparable benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. This improvement exceeds the minimal important difference for six-minute walk distance among people with ILD, which ranges from 30 to 33 metres (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2009</LINK>). This indicates that providing a pulmonary rehabilitation programme that is well aligned with current guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>) results in clinically important changes in functional capacity. Significant improvements were also seen in dyspnoea and in health-related quality of life following pulmonary rehabilitation, supporting the view that the observed improvement may be meaningful for patients.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Included studies involved participants with a range of ILDs, and studies often included samples of participants with mixed diagnoses (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mejia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mejia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-Bogerd-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Perez Bogerd 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wewel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wewel 2005</LINK>). This recruitment strategy probably reflects the relatively uncommon nature and the shared pathophysiological features of many ILDs. Participants with IPF often have more severe physiological derangement and a more rapid disease course compared with those with other ILDs (<LINK REF="REF-Lama-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lama 2004</LINK>), and we hypothesised that pulmonary rehabilitation might be less effective in people with IPF. However, this review indicates that participants with IPF did achieve significant improvement in six-minute walk test results, maximum exercise capacity, dyspnoea and health-related quality of life. Improvement in the six-minute walk test was smaller among participants with IPF (35.63 m vs 44.34 m); however this mean improvement still exceeded the minimal important difference for the six-minute walk distance in people with IPF, which is in the range of 29to 34 m (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2009</LINK>). Changes in quality of life, dyspnoea and maximum exercise capacity were also comparable in the subgroup of participants with IPF. Although patients with IPF appear to have smaller gains in functional capacity than those with other ILDs, they are equally important and meaningful for patients. Differences in functional outcomes do indicate that response to exercise may vary across the disease spectrum, which is not unexpected given the marked heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. It should be noted however that of the five studies contributing to the meta-analysis, three included only participants with IPF (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiyama 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>), whilst another included a majority of participants with IPF (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>); thus overall results of the meta-analysis are heavily influenced by the response of participants with IPF.</P>
<P>All studies in this review utilised aerobic exercise training or a combination of aerobic and resisted exercise training. These strategies are well aligned with current guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>), and the results therefore are readily applicable to clinical practice in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. However, we were unable to draw inferences regarding the most effective exercise training strategy for people with ILD. Given the relatively modest improvements in exercise capacity documented here, this may be an important area for future research. The included studies used a range of programme durations (five weeks to six months) and training frequencies (two to five sessions per week). Longer programmes and more frequent sessions appear to yield greater benefit for people with other chronic lung diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). To date the most effective dose of pulmonary rehabilitation for people with ILD has not been established.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Several potential sources of bias were identified in this review. Of the nine studies identified, six were available only in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Baradzina-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baradzina 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mejia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mejia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2011</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Perez-Bogerd-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Perez Bogerd 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainshelboim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vainshelboim 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wewel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wewel 2005</LINK>). These publications provided limited data on the outcomes of interest, and it was not possible for review authors to obtain additional data from study authors. Data that could be pooled for meta-analysis were usually limited to two or three studies. Despite this limitation, consistency was seen in most reported outcomes, with all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>) reporting improved functional exercise capacity following pulmonary rehabilitation. Reasons for lack of improvement in functional exercise capacity in the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2014</LINK>) are unclear but may have been related to the method by which the six-minute walk test was conducted or may have involved the small numbers of included participants. Assessment of study quality was also difficult because available data were limited. As pulmonary rehabilitation is a physical intervention, it can be assumed that no participants were blinded; however only one study reported blinding of the assessor (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>). Only one study reported use of an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2008</LINK>). Given the progressive nature of many ILDs, a significant dropout rate is likely and may impact both the size of the reported treatment effect and the feasibility of the intervention.</P>
<P>Review outcomes were rated as of moderate quality (six-minute walk distance) or low quality (all other outcomes) using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. Risk of bias was increased by poor reporting of methods and lack of assessor blinding. Imprecision was increased by the small numbers of included studies and participants, with one to five studies and 52 to 168 participants contributing to each outcome.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>All data were extracted independently by two review authors, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Risk of bias ratings were also completed independently by two review authors.</P>
<P>We conducted a broad search, which included handsearching of conference abstracts and trial registries. We included studies that were published only in abstract form, to ensure that all available trials were included. However, despite attempts to contact the authors of abstracts, in many cases additional data were not available. This may have influenced assessment of trial quality and some estimates of effect.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2008. Data included in the previous review suggested that improvement in functional exercise capacity following pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD was smaller than that seen in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006</LINK>); however this update has found comparable improvements. This is a significant finding that supports the recent international statement suggesting that people with ILD should be included in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). Although the previous review found that the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation tended to be smaller in people with IPF than in those with other types of ILD, this update has found similar, clinically important effects of rehabilitation in both groups, likely due to the larger number of trials including people with IPF that were included in this update.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>This review indicates that pulmonary rehabilitation seems to be safe for people with ILD and results in significantly improved functional exercise capacity, maximum exercise capacity, dyspnoea and health-related quality of life immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation. It is appropriate to include people with ILD in a standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme. To date, little evidence has suggested a long-term benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-09-29 10:54:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The optimum exercise training method for participants with ILD has not been established. Large studies are required to determine whether the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation vary according to disease severity and whether any longer-term effects are associated with pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD. Future trials should ensure that assessors are blinded to the intervention and that appropriate methods are used to account for dropouts.</P>
